My account gained around 2k in profits from the tech sector over the next few months. I lost that along with another 3k in June because I had 20k Twitter on margin with Robinhood gold and they got destroyed along with FB. I was at a 10k portfolio exactly a month ago. I was approved for options in June and finally was able to join you autists. I started seeing all these geniuses on wall street bets and decided to look for good DDs on here in the meantime while I learn more about different trading strategies.   Some of my positions that pushed me to 25k include cron, cgc, appl, amd, Yelp, sq, ba, and visa. I messed up a lot on FDs along the way and was going to buy lulu and Ulta FDs the other day but decided not to last second from my Best Buy burn Tuesday. The only thing I\u2019m mad about at WSB is losing thousands of dollars on MU, but at least now I can fit in. Anyways, thanks for the advice and shitposts.

Thinkolator says, with a rather tepid 85% likelihood, that this is Arista Networks (ANET).\n\nWhy Arista? Well, it is a cloud-focused networking equipment company, focused on the speedy movement of data\u2026 think Cisco (CSC)), but really focused on the biggest data center applications.\n\nAnd it does have a female CEO in the pretty understated Jayshree Ullal, who was recruited from Cisco to get Arista going about ten years ago.\n\nAnd we know that the Motley Fool has been investing in the stock, and that Tom Gardner himself had recommended it at least a couple times prior to a year ago, when it was the subject of a different Fool teaser ad. The Fool had only invested $280,000 at that time, but, depending on the actual price they paid, it could have been in the $533,000 neighborhood a couple weeks ago, when ANET was near all-time highs (or, of course, they could have invested more in the past year).\n\nAnd when it comes to the one semi-specific clue, the \u201czero to $1 billion\u201d in sales in eight years, that\u2019s an equally semi-specific match \u2014 Arista did start selling their products in 2008, though they didn\u2019t go public until 2014 (they were backed by some early Cisco scientists and Google investors, who bankrolled the first years of development), and they hit that billion-dollar level for annual sales late in 2016.\n\nInterestingly, given that this is the tenth anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, Lehman was actually their first big customer \u2014 the first wave of demand for this faster internet and faster data movement was among the high frequency traders, who could benefit from getting their data or placing their orders even a few milliseconds faster than the competition, and then other big companies who want to speed up their data started coming aboard. For a while they were plagued by back-and-forth patent infringement and intellectual property theft lawsuits with Cisco, but they settled most of that, at least temporarily, just a few weeks ago (part of the settlement was a 5-year embargo on most new litigation between the two, though there\u2019s also still an outstanding appeal on their older copyright case \u2014 so it\u2019s possible that the $400 million ANET paid in the settlement this year wont\u2019t entirely be the end, but the big stuff seems taken care of for now).\n\nI didn\u2019t invest in Arista last year, sadly (it\u2019s up a good 50% since I last wrote about them), but I summed it up as \u201chard to buy after a steep climb, but probably reasonably valued at a forward PE of 33 given the expectations of 20% earnings growth\u201d \u2014 the stock then had a strong few months in setting new highs over the winter, but since then has been fairly flat as growth expectations have come down considerably.\n\nSo what to do now? Arista reported fairly unexciting earnings in early August (good, but not fantastic \u2014 which counts as \u201cunexciting\u201d when you have a trailing PE of 99), then the stock popped up a little bit later in the month thanks (probably) to that Cisco settlement, and, more importantly, to the company being added to the S&P 500 (which usually creates a bit of temporary buying pressure, since all the index funds have to buy shares)\u2026 but it has come down in the past few weeks as tech stocks have come under pressure, and as at least one analyst downgraded the stock.\n\nAnalysts are actually fairly tepid on Arista in general, maybe because they think Cisco is getting its act together and taking some business back from them \u2014 they were just downgraded to hold by Morgan Stanley, for example, and average analyst earnings estimates for ANET are now for 15% annual growth\u2026 and there are more \u201chold\u201d ratings than \u201cbuy.\u201d\n\nThe average price target is now $288, the same as it has been since February, so this seems like a stock where the analysts have long been cautious about valuation and have really only lifted their price targets to keep up with the market \u2014 so it\u2019s going to have to be the next phase of surprising earnings growth that lifts the stock, I imagine, not some new excitement from Wall Street or another Motley Fool recommendation.\n\nThe risk for Arista, probably, is that they succumb to competition and lose some of their profit margin and see slowing revenue growth, like Juniper Networks (JNPR), the other \u201cpretty big\u201d Cisco competitor \u2014 Juniper is about half the size of Arista, but has more than twice Arista\u2019s revenue, and is also expected to have earnings growth of 15% next year (though analysts see Juniper\u2019s earnings growth slowing considerably to about 8% the following year). Arista is pretty clearly a stronger growth company, with more investor optimism and a technological lead and a strong customer base for their more focused offerings\u2026 but Juniper serves as a pretty useful warning sign of what could happen if earnings slow down more than expected for Arista \u2014 the stock is already mostly sitting still as investors and analysts chew on what kind of \u201cdeceleration\u201d there will be in earnings growth, so this would be a bad time for the company to report a disappointing quarter or two.\n\nThis Investors.com article sums up some of the analyst chatter about the race between Arista and Cisco to win \u201chyperscale\u201d customers (like that aforementioned Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon), much of it focused on who will win the first batch of customers for next-level 400-gigabit switches. Everything I read indicates that Arista still has an edge with these huge customers, but that there are plenty of risks \u2014 from Amazon developing its own switches to Cisco releasing next-generation switches a few months before Arista does.\n\nSo\u2026 color me still interested, but still not owning shares. \u201cDecelerating growth\u201d can lead to a lumpy stock market ride as investors who enjoyed Arista\u2019s crazy surge in 2017 reset their expectations, so I will keep an eye on this one to see if we get some more selling that makes the price more attractive. The stock is trading at a forward PE of 31 and is expected to grow earnings at 15%, so that\u2019s a PEG ratio of just about 2\u2026 which is probably reasonable, but not cheap.", "score": 5, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 14, "submission_ratio": 0.35714285714285715, "submission_title": "What's Motley Fool's dumb double-down of the week?", "submission_text": "Saw an ad for Motley Fool's latest \"double down\" (not as good as KFC's imho).
