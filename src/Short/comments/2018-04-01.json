And I do mean disruptive as hell.\n\nThis technology, when deployed, could cut the cost of the cost of the fuel price for electricity by as much as 99% while service contracts for wires and such will still be a charge until portable devices intended for individual home usage are still being worked out. And yes, that will likely be the end result of this. And to be honest, if the government and/or Lockheed Martin do not move in this direction then we the people need to push the government to nationalize the technology and provide it to promote the general welfare. Its just that simple after you quit listening to the profit people and asking \"what is the best way we can productively deploy this to take as much necessary productivity investment out of the equation so that saved productivity can be used elsewhere to solve other problems.\n\nWith that said, I'm pro high tech. Genetics, nanotech, biotech (protein creation and production is potentially the most profitable industry of the decade starting in 1-2 years as there are so many potential applications to this technology it boggles the mind), and quantum computing (The recent discovery of a method of making billions of quibits using silicon is another mind boggling game changer)\n\nThese are examples of high tech I'd focus in and where I am slowing transferring almost 90% of my investments at the moment with 10% going toward blockchain research and development. I'm reserving the right to pull all of my investments out of everything and into the first viable life extension / anti-aging concept that proves marketable although I think that is going to come from the protein creation department personally.

DCA is, because you're anticipating more favorable buying opportunities at some unknown time. LSI outperforms DCA.\n\n>In this paper, we compare the historical performance of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with lump-sum investing (LSI) across three markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. On average, we find that an LSI approach has outperformed a DCA approach approximately two-thirds of the time, even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock/bond portfolio versus cash investments.\n\n> We conclude that if an investor expects such trends to continue, is satisfied with his or her target asset allocation, and is comfortable with the risk/return characteristics of each strategy, the prudent action is investing the lump sum immediately to gain exposure to the markets as soon as possible. But if the investor is primarily concerned with minimizing downside risk and potential feelings of regret (resulting from lump-sum investing immediately before a market downturn), then DCA may be of use. Of course, any emotionally based concerns should be weighed carefully against both (1) the lower expected long-run returns of cash compared with stocks and bonds, and **(2) the fact that delaying investment is itself a form of market-timing**, something few investors succeed at. \n\n[Source](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf)", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 129, "submission_ratio": 0.015503875968992248, "submission_title": "what to do with $50000 in inherited stock", "submission_text": "I have 1800 shares of ppl stock which is worth about $50000. ppl is a midcap utility company that has not been doing so well the past year (down about 25%).

BABA -- I've been watching them closely. They are seeing one edge of their growth engine drying up, a kind of loan for businesses. The reason is that there is a crackdown on enterprise lending in China. That being said, they are growing in microfinance, and there is no other commerce engine in China that can match their sales revenue per year. They are a juggernaut, and as they expand globally, they will continue to expand their profit margins and their revenue. \n\n2. Tencent -- their work in gaming is going to be unsurpassed in China and Asia. \n\n3. JD -- JD is an interesting story, because they are, like Baidu, one of the few companies in China that will be unrestrained from the government in working with autonomous vehicles for delivery. They are especially secretive about their drones program, but that will be huge, and I believe China will be one of the first countries to delve into autonomous delivery via drone. I have been to their headquarters in Beijing, and saw a presentation about this in Chinese that convinced me that they are growing big but it's under the radar. \n\n4. Baidu -- for obvious reasons, like their search engine category, but also ro their growth in AI, autonomous cars, robotics, and more. I think they are a powerful company.\n\n5. Upcoming IPO that hasn't even been announced yet, but some time in 2019, I think is a company called Changba. Look for them. They have a great product -- a karaoke microphone -- that streams music and human voices to audiences all over the network. I see huge machine learning and AI capability built into this, and from what I can tell, they would find huge synergies with Baidu and Tencent, and other media companies. \n\nI could go on. But without too many particulars, I can give you some other names. \n\nNetease\nMOMO\n\nAnd there is a rumour that NextEV, the company that makes the NIO super electric car, may this year or next be publicly listed. I would totally dive into that. I know a lot of Chinese investors who privately own one, but they don't drive them, because the government has not cleared them for public use. I think once they do clear them, you can look for an IPO soon after. \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/chinese-startup-nio-is-said-to-consider-u-s-listing-next-year\n\n", "score": 7, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 8, "submission_ratio": 0.875, "submission_title": "Portfolio Idea: Buy the US-Listed China tech stocks, and manufacturing stocks", "submission_text": "The Chinese government looks pretty intent on letting the previously US-listed China companies also list in the Mainland markets, which would certainly improve their valuations or at least bring a bit of speculation and / or China POV to the valuations. \nIf that is the case, I think you can expect all of the stocks currently listed as ADRs in America to jump in value, maybe between 3-4%. \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-01/china-unveils-its-plan-to-bring-nation-s-tech-giants-back-home", "parent_text": "Is there 1 company you like more than the rest?", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 2.3333333333333335}, {"time": 1522637049.0, "submission_id": "88vw1b", "comment_id": "dwnog28", "body": "Baba!", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 8, "submission_ratio": 0.375, "submission_title": "Portfolio Idea: Buy the US-Listed China tech stocks, and manufacturing stocks", "submission_text": "The Chinese government looks pretty intent on letting the previously US-listed China companies also list in the Mainland markets, which would certainly improve their valuations or at least bring a bit of speculation and / or China POV to the valuations. \nIf that is the case, I think you can expect all of the stocks currently listed as ADRs in America to jump in value, maybe between 3-4%. \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-01/china-unveils-its-plan-to-bring-nation-s-tech-giants-back-home", "parent_text": "Is there 1 company you like more than the rest?", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1522648073.0, "submission_id": "88vw1b", "comment_id": "dwnvkag", "body": "Good one.
