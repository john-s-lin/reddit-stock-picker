Apple's biggest profit maker is the Iphone, right? It seems that Apple and every other tech company realized that the way the phone is now is basically as best as it is going to get unless something revolutionary came along. Since Cook took over, he has basically been stocking piling free cash to buy out anything that Apple sees fit. I think Apple realized the limitations of cell phone technology and began hoarding the cash flow from Iphone sales until they could make a strategic decision in the direction they want to take.\n\n[Look at the cash flow chart in Cook's reign.](https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Apple-3.png)\n\nHe's not an idiot. Sure he made mistakes and most likely his time as CEO is coming to an end. Cook did his job tremendously. He took Jobs products, sold and marketed it to record profits, and positioned Apple with the free cash flow to be relevant for decades to come. Steve Cook is no Jobs. He's an executive, not a designer or visionary. I think Cook will step down in the next two years or so. They have a lot of new healthcare technology coming out and I think the will step down after that and let a designer take over direction of the company. Maybe Ive, I'm not sure, but it seems like it would be the best bet.
