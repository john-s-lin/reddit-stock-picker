Our competition includes offerings from companies such as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Facebook, Corel, Microsoft, Quark and others, as well as from many lower-end offerings.\n\n>We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software. Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers will be encouraged to use the image and video editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.\n\n>The stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily operates today with our Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images and a number of smaller companies.\n\n>The nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web or via mobile applications.\n\n>Our Experience Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Marketo, Oracle, salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Verizon, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. Additionally, new competitors are constantly entering these markets.\n\n>Our Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies, as well as lower-end desktop publishing products.

Sketch is a ~150MB standalone download, whereas anything Adobe-related is funneled through Creative Cloud and is a pain in the ass to set up.\n\nOn top of that, Adobe\u2019s products have 25 years of bloat baked in and it\u2019s starting to show. When Photoshop takes 20 seconds to open on a $3k macbook pro then you\u2019ve got issues. It also has stuff like video editing, 3D rendering and loads of photo processing tools (which is what it was built for). They\u2019re hellbent on adding bolt ons as opposed to developing clean software.\n\nHistorically, in the context of UX and UI, Photoshop was used when no better alternatives existed and Adobe didn\u2019t act fast enough.\n\nThey\u2019re trying to change that with XD, but again they\u2019ve already lost the first mover advantage a while ago and momentum is a big thing when it comes to picking your tools. That\u2019s part  of the reason why Adobe stuck around so long in the first place.\n\nPersonally, I have slight concerns with Sketch as another poster pointed out, they\u2019re very slowly falling victim to featurism which ends up introducing bloat.\n\nThis is where new challengers are coming in. We recently ended up using Figma for a massive insurance company (named after a certain individual) as it provided better file syncing for a large design team and has cloud-based collaborative artifact creation. Something both Sketch and all of Adobe\u2019s products lack.\n\nAgain, I\u2019d like to point out that Adobe have a place and time in the product pipeline. Illustrator is very good, and I\u2019m judging their product lineup from a purely UX/UI perspective as that\u2019s where my bread and butter lies and my opinions/experience are coming from that particular lens.\n\nMy underlying point is that most UX/UI designers will never want to use an Adobe product as there are way better, proven alternatives out there.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t confirm or deny that three letter company :)\n\n\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 57, "submission_ratio": 0.05263157894736842, "submission_title": "Adobe has \"zero\" competition?", "submission_text": "[removed]", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 3.0}, {"time": 1520422133.0, "submission_id": "82fgsl", "comment_id": "dvbdnjb", "body": "To be honest, definitely not...

Whether your portfolio increases $1 in value because you got a dollar in dividends and reinvested *or* because the company you're investing in retained the money for that dividend (and your existing holding is just worth $1 more) doesn't really matter.\n\nA dividend is nice come retirement, because it's a way to draw cash out of your portfolio without a sale (avoiding the headache of constant rebalancing and avoiding transaction costs). However, while you're accumulating (and just reinvesting the dividends), a dividend is *at best* exactly equal to other growth (and, if held in a taxable account, potentially worse, as dividends are taxable but growth within the company is not).\n\nAs a result, it's worth remembering that many high dividend yield and/or dividend growth companies are mature, stable companies. While that's great and makes their dividend feel more \"guaranteed\" (not 100%, by the way. Remember that GE was a \"dividend aristocrat\" until 2009), it may mean they have little room for growth, such that your overall investment lags the market (which is bad since, at this stage, you should just care about growth, in whatever form it takes). Take $T, one of the all-time classic dividend aristocrats. Since January 1986, a regular S&P index fund ($VFINX) has returned a half percent more annually than T (and with *less* standard deviation/max drawdowns, actually). The market may pay less dividends than AT&T, but it also has had more room to grow than AT&T.\n\n[This is a good paper on dividend investing](https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/ISGADOS.pdf). One key takeaway is that historically, dividend portfolios are a stand-in for low volatility/value (in the case of high yield dividend portfolios) and low volatility/quality (in the case of dividend growth portfolios). If you're in a good time period for those factors, you'll do well and if not, you'll underperform. Regardless, my take away is that if what you actually like about dividend investing are those underlying factors, invest with an eye towards them directly (rather than through the screen of dividends).", "score": 18, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 43, "submission_ratio": 0.4186046511627907, "submission_title": "Best Long Term Dividend Stocks?", "submission_text": "Looking through some stock filters and seeing companies like Ford,  P&G, Coke, Pepsi, etc all having 3%+ dividends and a very stable/long life.  \n\nWould there be any reason to avoid these stocks?

HOWEVER, liquidity is VERY low in the am. Therefore, if there is a buy such as this 100 share lot, the price you see in A.M. is misleading DUE to the low liquidity/morning volume..\n\nSpend the next couple days, if able, to look at some stocks in premarket, and look at their volume. You will see that sometimes the price may be up xx% but it's misleading due to the small purchase and low volume...once the market opens, more volume comes into play as retail Investors begin to buy or sell at market open, thus creating more liquidity in the stock and market acts as it sees fit. More liquidity= a larger order book (bids/ask), therefore providing a better overall picture of the stocks price action.\n\nPM stocks can sometimes be manipulated to the average person by propping up the price with a small share purchase at a high price, but if volume is only 100 shares, that's garbage! It takes time and skill to learn how to trade in PM & AH due to risks of liquidity.

And I won't say \"fake news\". But your synopsis of current goings on in the world are a bit out of tune. At this time, there is not a lot of \"agitation\" in the world. Sure, there's some. Always has been and always will be. But thankfully, we have a POTUS who's standing up for our country as we've been walked over and used by other nations for decades - not anymore. And a POTUS who expects other nations to REALLY \"pay their fair share\" (see tarriffs/EU/increased exports). A POTUS who's working to level out NK and KJU. Currently talks to occur with Iran, Taliban. I mean, with all the stupid bullshit phony narratives the Democrats continue to push, in the background, POTUS is working to calm the world and work towards global peace (who doesn't want that? By the global terrorism has been down \ud83d\ude00)\n\nI definitely would not pull out of the stock market. I have friends, staunch liberals, who withdrew all funds for fear of loss. My 401k has done quite well. They've missed out \n\nI think one potential problem is when a large percentage or all of any society receives *something* from government, once measures of austerity are put in place, things go cookoo. Like in Greece 7 or 8 years back. But, I don't see POTUS doing anything like this. \n\nFor the upcoming election, the alternative plan to what's underway now with Trump is:\n\n1. Increased taxation\n2. Elimination of tax cuts\n3. Drastic reduction in military\n4 Somehow, someway an attempt at a single-payer healthcare system that would cost 32.6T over 10 years. And with only tax increases to fund it (add 10% VAT, income [increase 10%] and an additional 10 % for a total of 30% or more tax increase on most all Americans. (Sounds great with the exception of actually being able to fund it and of course it being government run healthcare)\n5. FREE school - $$ ??\n6. The abolition of ICE. Those who police our borders, on average, preventing 10 terrorists daily from entering our country. Democrats want ICE gone. We already know ms-13 is in the country. ICE is who apprehends this garbage from our streets. If ICE were to be abolished our country would be fucked. To hell with all the political shit talk, fact is, without ICE and unenforced borders we'd be overrun by terrorists, gangsters, people who have ill will towards our country and God only knows who else.\n\n**Notice that Democrats can't attack POTUS's agenda. Because they know it's proven a success. So they can only attack him personally and with their ongoing Russia collusion narrative when all along POTUS has been FAR tougher on Russia than and previous administration. Barack Obama is who was over heard on hot mic explaining that he'd \"have more flexibility after the election\" (hmm, interesting all things considered), Obama is who told the nation from the Rose garden at the WH that Russia couldn't do anything (ie mess with elections/voting) all the while Russia was working nefariously in the background AND Barack Obama knew as he had been informed by IT Intel at the time AND Barack Obama told IT team to \"prioritize other items\" ahead of Russian issues (in other words Russia bullshit began during Obama's tenure); it was Susan Rice who unmasked individuals and Barack Obama who wiretapped Trump tower; HRC and DNC. funded fake dossier. FISA warrants signed off using fake dossier. And had HRC been elected, we'd have never known a thing about any of this. Democrats have had to scuddle around, refuse to speak to congress and ignore court subpoenas to hide their guilt. The facts as they stand simply leave no room for any other possibility than corrupt, partisan high ranking FBI working in coordination with HRC, the DNC amongst others to ensure that Donald Trump was ousted and that HRC would be our next president.  And honestly, they did a pretty damn good job in all their shadiness, subverting our laws etc at getting HRC in office. But HRC's own arrogance was her demise. By overlooking important constituencies and regarding 1/2 the nation as \"deplorable\", calling everyone\"racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic, islamophobic, blah, blah, blah\", she fucked herself. Funny for all the blood, sweat and tears Democrats lost in playing their crooked game and hoops  jumped, just like that, HRC blew it all, the dummy! Thank God for our founders and their decision for an electoral system! The wise guys knew well in advance times as these would be upon us.\n\nI honestly can't see how anyone would vote Democratic. \n\nProblem I see: the Democratic political elite (class) and the Democratic electorate are on 2 pages. The political class have an agenda, which largely is power driven but an agenda that will damage the US irreparably. Democratic politicians package everything under one form or another of identity politics (GLBT, international, gender, pay issues, abortion, environmental issues and more) which is all fine and good as far as the everyday, local voter is concerned in taking concern with these issues. But I believe the Democratic electorate is attached to whichever of the issues they choose, giving power, unwittingly, to a Democratic political class who otherwise have a far different (and not so secretive) agenda underway. And with research, going back to the 1800's one can find these answere. In short, I believe the Democratic electorate is being utilized to build its power structure. And because they're struggling, now trying to sell repackaged socialism, they need as many illegal citizens as possible to boost their votes in November. Hence: abolish ICE, they don't like voter ID laws (because dead people voting is A-OK with them and NEVER have been interested in cleaning the rolls or simply ensuring voter integrity). Simply put, I believe the Democratic electorate are good people. They just don't have the same agenda in mind as does the Democratic political class. And the Democratic political class will continue to divide, divide, divide, and drive wedge after wedge (male/female, rich/poor, gay/straight, prolife/prochoice, race/race & nationality/nationality) until we, as a nation, are so divided that we simply cannot stand.\n\nI could go on and on and on. But to your thinking, I'd say invest, have fun. POTUS is balancing and correcting decades worth of shit that previous administrations either ignored, caused or kicked along down the road.  It's no surprise times could be a little rocky til things settle. But not rocky as in 1/2 the nation on welfare, high unemployment, low GDP etc.\n\nAnd remember that POTUS has kept ALL of his promises. He's still working healthcare and border wall. I can't remember the last president who kept all promises.\n\nhttp://www.promiseskept,com\n\n[Edit 1] web address hyperlink.
