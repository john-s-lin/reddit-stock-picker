Annual fees: Nobody charges as much in annual fees as American Express. Sure there are some Chase Visa products that carry a $450 fee in the US but the AMEX Platinum not so recently raised their fee to beyond $500. The difference in the next step down to Gold vs. a Visa or MC equivalent is laughable; Amex still costs more. \n\n2. Merchant fees: The reason AMEX is accepted in less places is because the perception is that the fee they charge merchants to swipe their card is typically much higher than V or MC. Granted AMEX customers spend more per month and year than their plastic counterparts (https://wallethub.com/edu/market-share-by-credit-card-network/25531/) but if you\u2019re talking to a typical business owners they see the fee rate and balk at the idea of accepting. \n\n3. Co-brand partnerships: The branded partnerships within AMEX have changed a lot in the last few years, at least domestically in the US. The loss of Costco and JetBlue had a large impact and the big partnerships of Delta and Starwood Hotels are brands with lots of competition and concern themselves. \n\nAll of these things I believe have caused instability with the Amex brand whereas if you look at Visa, they have had lower annual fees, lower merchant fees, and very stable partnerships with other brands and financial institutions. \n\nAll that said, I *love* my Amex and have been a member since I was 26. I use it for everything. If you know how to leverage cash flow and maximize the MR points the product and its ancillary features more than make up for the annual fee and the customer service is second to none. However, the three big points above are what I believe will keep the stock from performing like V or MC and will see much more volatility. \n\nTl;dr: Amex is a quality brand but their fees and constantly changing partnerships keep it from being a stable growth investment like V or MC.

TSLA fell for a couple reasons, IMO. First is that the 18.5k delivery number \"missed\" consensus estimates by thirty-some percent. Analysts covering Tesla generally have poor estimates though, and are not in-tune with the companies operations. Some are, but most are not. The analysts failed to take into account that Tesla would be holding back on Model 3 deliveries to avoid hitting 200,000 lifetime deliveries in the US, triggering the beginning of the phaseout of the federal tax credit. It's extremely likely that this is what Tesla did due to having 11k+ Model 3's produced but not delivered in the quarter, as well as diverting deliveries to Canada. This was predictable, I talked about it on my podcast in May, immediately after the earnings report.\n\nSecond, TSLA is the most shorted stock on the market. It is prone to manipulation. This week is a low volume week and historically TSLA has faired poorly in those predictably low volume weeks. Read into that however you want, but after following TSLA every day for the past 5 years, it is clear that there is a driving force behind that.

This one still looks like the stock price is based on everything going remarkably well. \n\nAbout eight years ago I was like \"They're priced like everything's going to go right for ten years, and something's already gone wrong.\" (At that point, I meant \"the price of oil is no longer $100/barrel.\")  \nPeople frequently point out that if people really trusted the company, the [bonds would be tracking the stock performance. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/major-disconnect-between-tesla-shares-and-bonds-signals-problems.html)  \n\n\nI'm going to take another quick look because a few months back I looked and went \"Yup, still priced like everyone's going to be able to sell to a greater fool.\"   \n\n\nIn detail: they are selling at 5 times SALES (not earnings, which are of course severely negative). They have a market cap of $55 billion, higher than Ford. Ford had revenues of 150 billion last year. Tesla had revenues of 11 billion last year. At some point if they're tremendously successful, they will go to \\[say\\] 150 billion a year in revenue, and let's say they make 15 billion in revenue. (Ford made 7 billion on their 150 billion, so that's twice the profit margin. ) They'd be as big as GM or Ford. That's the best possible case, and they'd have a price-to-future-earnings of about 4. So figure they need to be at around $75 billion per annum and making twice the profit margin of Ford.   \n\n\nFord sells 8 million cars a year. Tesla made 7,000 total cars on their best-yet week, so that's 350,000 cars a year.   \n\n\nThey would need to grow by a factor of 10 to be worth what they're selling for. (And let us temporarily ignore the $12 billion of bonds at, what, 6&#37;?)   \n\n\nThe possible downside, of course, is the value of the stock goes to zero. Elon Musk burnt half a billion dollars of cash last quarter, so at that rate he's got around a year of cash left. I don't think he's got a lot of tricks left if he runs out of money again.

", "parent_text": "TL:DR I like to make investments where the stock price is based on everything going about average. This one still looks like the stock price is based on everything going remarkably well. \n\nAbout eight years ago I was like \"They're priced like everything's going to go right for ten years, and something's already gone wrong.\" (At that point, I meant \"the price of oil is no longer $100/barrel.\")  \nPeople frequently point out that if people really trusted the company, the [bonds would be tracking the stock performance. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/major-disconnect-between-tesla-shares-and-bonds-signals-problems.html)  \n\n\nI'm going to take another quick look because a few months back I looked and went \"Yup, still priced like everyone's going to be able to sell to a greater fool.\"   \n\n\nIn detail: they are selling at 5 times SALES (not earnings, which are of course severely negative). They have a market cap of $55 billion, higher than Ford. Ford had revenues of 150 billion last year. Tesla had revenues of 11 billion last year. At some point if they're tremendously successful, they will go to \\[say\\] 150 billion a year in revenue, and let's say they make 15 billion in revenue. (Ford made 7 billion on their 150 billion, so that's twice the profit margin. ) They'd be as big as GM or Ford. That's the best possible case, and they'd have a price-to-future-earnings of about 4. So figure they need to be at around $75 billion per annum and making twice the profit margin of Ford.   \n\n\nFord sells 8 million cars a year. Tesla made 7,000 total cars on their best-yet week, so that's 350,000 cars a year.   \n\n\nThey would need to grow by a factor of 10 to be worth what they're selling for. (And let us temporarily ignore the $12 billion of bonds at, what, 6&#37;?)   \n\n\nThe possible downside, of course, is the value of the stock goes to zero. Elon Musk burnt half a billion dollars of cash last quarter, so at that rate he's got around a year of cash left. I don't think he's got a lot of tricks left if he runs out of money again.

If you really like China, why not something like 75% in a Fund like VTI or VOO and then 5% each into five of those Chinese companies to make up the remaining 25%? That still gives you a considerable amount of exposure to China but at least doesn\u2019t put all your eggs into one basket (in this case, a country).\n\nChina has a lot of potential and is really interesting but there are also a lot of concerns, issues, and problems with the country and its economy/market. And this is coming from someone who is pretty bullish on them over the course of the next decade. Just beware that these companies will be very volatile, frustrating, and downright crazy at times in how they behave.\n\nIf you truly must go all China alone, I would do something like 50% Tencent and then 10-15% each in companies like BABA, JD, IQ, etc. This gives you exposure to a few different sectors and while these stocks are still very risky and volatile plays, you\u2019re at least focusing on some of the more well known and fairly established companies in China. Tencent is a huge and more established company which is why I recommend going heavier on them. I wouldn\u2019t go over five companies total as it will limit your ability to truly research and understand them, which is likely to be more difficult with foreign investments.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t want to hear it but investing in China is still a massive gamble. The nation is full of potential and intrigue but this isn\u2019t the first time people believed that China is finally ready to break out. We\u2019ve been here before and were only left disappointed yet again. Like I said, I\u2019m pretty optimistic on the nation over the next 5-10 years but I\u2019m also not confident or optimistic enough to risk investing my whole portfolio into the country and sacrificing diversity.\n\nWhichever route you go, as someone with a moderate chunk of my portfolio invested in China I\u2019m wishing you luck.
