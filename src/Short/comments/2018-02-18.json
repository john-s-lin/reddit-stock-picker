They won't let you sell your shares at will, so whether or not the investment is doing well, you have to keep it. That's only ok if it's an investment that is relatively stable, which stocks/shares are not. \n\nThe second reason is that if you leave the company, they pay you at acquisition value or market value; a great deal for them as it guarantees they will profit and guarantees that you won't profit in case you leave the company. This puts you in a terrible position, as it takes away your biggest bargaining chip when negotiating promotions/raises; you can't leave and go work elsewhere (or you would be surrendering any profits you had).\n\nRight now the open market is doing great, and stocks/mutual funds bought on the open market are completely liquid. At current rates, it's a much greater risk to invest in just one privately owned company. \n\nAnd in the end, those rules they make you abide by are intended to screw you and benefit them.
