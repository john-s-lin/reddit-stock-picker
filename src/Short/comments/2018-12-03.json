After designing it with an HDL you generate a netlist. After, you need to *exhaustively verify* the design to make sure that the underlying hardware and logic match up. Verification alone is 75% if the job. You need to place and route and then perform a timing analysis. And then verify some more to make sure it matches your spec. After all this you send the design to a manufacturer which, by the way, has an upfront cost of millions on top of the price you pay per chip. If you fuck up one step and realize it too late after the chip has been manufactured, then it's back to the drawing board and you've wasted millions. By the way, make sure you do all this quickly, otherwise the market would've already rendered your design outdated\n\nThis isn't something you make in your garage. Even if a \"steve jobs\" did all this and made a super graphics card, nvda would buy him out before he even had a chance to market it and release it.\n\n>I\u2019m so tired of people talking about how NVDA will play a crucial role in AI and self driving car and shit.\n\nThey will.
