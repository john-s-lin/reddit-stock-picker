Now on some days I wake up thinking I'm some type of contrarian \"for the sake of being contrarian\" moron for not owning Amazon. Some days I look at my other investments and am glad I'm not holding Amazon. I just personally see it as holding risk. If Amazon's revenue growth slows to even something like 8% yoy I think the stock will take quite a hit. Is that going to happen? ...As if I know. Is a gain of 30+ percent revenue likely year after year? Again, I want to say now, but Amazon is unique in its boldness and might. \n\nOne thing I can say somewhat confidently, is that the more sectors that Amazon enters, the higher chance of Amazon experiencing a formidable headwind in one of them. On one hand with the added diversity comes some relative safety (if one sector is struggling but the other 8 are crushing then who really cares?) but if they stretch themselves too thin and can't throw money at that headwind, *and* an economic downturn happens resulting in a slightly down Prime membership, then I think that could spell serious trouble. I just cannot buy Amazon, and I'll either always look stubborn, or I'll look stubborn until I made a lucky call, because I certainly don't know enough about the inner working of Amazon to have a true grasp on the variables. For now Amazon is the king, but a lot of companies of significant size are feeling the Amazon burn and are going to protect their corner.... though to no avail, yet.

I will tell you my view. My personal opinion is that you shouldn't look where everybody is looking. Even if it grows 100% is size you have already paying 157 times the average 5 years cash flows (the net money it generates). \n\nSo it would take big amount of time to get your investment back. True the company can grow. But companies don't grow forever and as soon as you start getting earning under the forecast also investor would start doubting it the greatly overpriced share could become less overpriced. Moreover everybody in this moment is trying to figure out a way of fucking amazon. They are hurting many many businesses and there are many of them even very powerful (Walmart+Google) that are trying to do something about it (Jet acquisition by walmart). I personally don't think they have a business that is no replaceable quite easily by other companies especially if they start to increase prices like they should if they want to become profitable.\n\nBuying an amazing company at a crazy price is never a good investment. A good book that explains that is the intelligent investor by ben graham. The extreme summary of the book is that very often companies that are over expensive tend to underperform, while companies that are the underdog tend to do better than the others even because nobody expects much of them. And honestly they're less risky costing less. \n\nIn closure, It never happened in the past that there's a single company in the world and won't happen even though Amazon is trying to put a foot everywhere, they will stop growing so fast in the future, they'll grow less like many of the biggest company and the cost of their price per earning/flow will drop.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 37, "submission_ratio": 0.08108108108108109, "submission_title": "$AMZN doing too much ?", "submission_text": "IS there such a thing as doing too much?\n\nI've been holding off on buying Amazon as I think it is overpriced and they're trying to be an expert in everything.  \n\nIt also seems people are investing far into the future with this stock.\n\nWhat are some comparable companies in the past that successfully did what Amazon is doing?\n", "parent_text": "$AMZN doing too much ?

There's no clear cut way to say \"ok I have information and this is what I'm going to do with it.\" People take many different approaches. One common and very easy approach, is to take a company's financial reports, use earnings/assets depreciated over time along with other projected changes in spending/revenue to determine its current value, and then buy it if it's currently worth less than what you believe it should be worth. You can also invest off of technical analysis, by looking for indicators like rsi, or maybe looking at twitter hashtag analytics, whatever you want.\n\n>I just started investing on Robin Hood and that's the part I'm having a hard time with.\n\nFor starters, I would recommend downloading some 10Ks and 10Qs, looking over them, and using them to come up with how much you think a company should be worth. Off of that, decide whether or not to buy teh company.

If a poll of investment \u201cexperts\u201d had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, their guesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500.

Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is an ability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to look unimaginative for a sustained period \u2013 or even to look foolish \u2013 is also essential.\n\n", "score": -2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 31, "submission_ratio": -0.06451612903225806, "submission_title": "ETFs Vs Mutual Funds", "submission_text": "Hey guys,\n\nI understand the fundamental difference between an ETF and a mutual fund (ETF can be bought sold throughout the day), But can someone give me pros and cons of investing in a mutual fund vs an ETF?\n\nIs the primary difference that ETF's are more liquid in the event that you need to pull out your money?

There is no one right answer.\n\nLet's say you want to find an S&P 500 index tracker.  Look at both ETFs and mutual funds.  Most importantly, look at expense ratio.  Generally, pick the one with lower fees, whichever it is.  But you might also want to look at portfolio, past performance compared to the index, manager tenure... you might notice one of them is poorly managed and isn't tracking the index well, and choose to avoid it.  Or say you want to invest in Asian tech, you might see one is heavy on BABA while one is heavy on Samsung, and you like BABA better.  In other words, don't focus on whether it's an etf or fund, just focus on which one is the best choice for your goals.\n\nAlso look at commissions.  If you plan on selling within 90 days, 99% of the time the ETF is cheaper because a lot of mutual funds have early disposal fees.  But if you plan on holding long term- is there a commission-free etf you like, or a no load/no fee mutual fund?  Pick the free one.  Check to see if there are events that will trigger a fee (like early disposal).  This will vary a lot by brokerage and fund so look for the lowest commissions.\n\nIs this a retirement account, or one you'll be making regular investments in?  A mutual fund might be better.  An ETF you have to buy a share, whatever the cost.  A fund, if you just want to put in $100/month, you can do that, regardless of share price.  So it's better for automatic investing.  I've never actually looked if you can reinvest dividends on ETFs- I assume so- but if that's important to you look that up too.\n\nIs this super speculative, where you can see swings of 4-5% throughout a day and you'll be actively trading a lot?  In that case, definitely an ETF.  Obviously funds you can only trade at the end of the day, whereas an ETF you can get out immediately if it starts to dive.\n\nAs you can see it depends entirely on the situation and you should decide on a case-by-case basis.  As a general rule, I use no load/no fee mutual funds for my retirement accounts so I can just put in a set amount each month, reinvest dividends, transactions are free, and I don't care about selling or buying quickly because I'm holding for decades.
