In Canada I suggest canntrust and organigram. Both much much cheaper than bigger peers, both with very solid management and both takeover targets. Canntrust excels at higher margin oils which is key as flower prices come down.  Canopy is the biggest but the market cap is too high vs names I mentioned. \n\nStill, the time to make massive bank was a years ago when legalization was less assured and institutions were less involved. That time is currently now in the USA. If you believe there\u2019s no turning back and the USA will continue to allow more and more legal markets..that\u2019s where you park money. Top picks are actually Canadian companies which operate in the USA (beware on a whole the USA sector is full of pump and dump scams and you must do some diligence)- MPX, ianthus, cannaroyalty, liberty health sciences. I also like kush bottles..a solid ancillary play. \n\nGood luck. Pm if you wanna chat.

I want to address the question above because I see it frequently and it is something everyone should understand before investing.  When it comes to value of a company, the share price is 100% meaningless.  When looking at the face value of a company, the easiest way to view their size is by looking at their market cap.  \n\nTwo companies could have a market cap of $100,000 (we'll assume they're very small companies).  If Company A issued 100,000 shares, their share price would be $1. If Company B issued 1,000 shares, their share price would be $100. That doesn't mean that Company B is worth 100x of Company A's value, it just means that there are fewer shares so each share is worth more. \n\nLooking at Tesla, it is worth $5b more than Ford, but worth $8b less than Honda, $11b less than GM, and $163b less than Toyota (side note, Im shocked Toyota is worth that much more than the rest).

I would never ever use that logic again, as a previous comment was exactly right when saying the individual investor did not get saved in other situations. That is being too naive. Please don\u2019t ever follow that logic as a means of investment guidance.\n\nWatch the movie \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d or \u201cThe Big Short\u201d or a documentary or a read a book or anything just something about the 08-09 crisis. John Doe got screwed. \n\nAnd why would you brush off the cash burn rate because you \u201cassume\u201d they\u2019ll figure it out? Not sound logic, especially if you have been keeping up with the aforementioned problems acquiring additional capital. It\u2019s a quick check and by no means definitive, and I have not looked at their balance sheet prior to this, as I have no interest in owning Tesla but if they are  bleeding cash and are highly leveraged, that\u2019s not a positive indicator and surely not a great buy-side attribute.\n\nA recent thread discussed a gentlemen whose entire retirement portfolio was allocated in GE stock, which IMO has a much larger footprint and importance to the American economy than does Tesla and they could be forced into restructuring or ultimately liquidation if it got bad enough. You and I would lose our equity position in them and some institution or other entity would likely swoop in and purchase all the assets at a ridiculous discount with no concern about where our money went. \n\nAs a common shareholder, you are owed nothing by the Company. If you hold debt in the Company, you put yourself in a better position in the event of liquidation but there are multiple levels of creditors who may potentially be paid back.\n\nAnd downvote me to hell, and mine is not perfect by any means, but if you\u2019re going into an industry where you will be around things of this nature, ensure a nice brush up on grammar and things of that nature is performed. I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s phone related and it\u2019s not meant to be as mean as it probably sounds; but presentation is key in so many scenarios and attention to detail does not go unnoticed and will separate you from those who aren\u2019t, in a very noticeable manner.\n\nTheir stuff that they\u2019re bringing is over there.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 50, "submission_ratio": 0.02, "submission_title": "What are things you look for in a company when investing?

Bank loans given to tesla are with very high interest rate which makes the problem even worse long term.\n\nElon has a tendency to promise the moon and deliver a tree then hypes it a lot in Twitter and his fanbase follows.\n\nI like tesla for only few stuff is that they relaunched the idea of EV car to a level never seen before.However, i think other companies will take the lead from them.\nTesla has a very good brand value which  I believe is their strongest \"asset\".\n\nThe gigafactory for batteries was a interesting investment which I think will pay many folds in the future if they stay solvent. \nSolarCity however was a purchase that the board should have never allowed.\n\nI don't like shorting stocks but If i did I would short tesla\n\nDisosure : I don't own a tesla stock this is my opinion (SELL)\n\nEdit: Tesla has same market cap as BMW and Ford however sells hundreds of thousands cars less than them and also spends less than BMW in R&D which is unjustifiable for a company that preaches to be the next big thing.\n\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 50, "submission_ratio": 0.02, "submission_title": "What are things you look for in a company when investing?

Solid revenue growth, decent profits, reasonable debt. It\u2019s all there.

They skyrocketed like the rest of the mark in 2016-2017 but I feel a lot of it was unwarranted and too much too fast. They did well but shouldn\u2019t have been traded as high as they were.\n\nTelecom and utilities have both taken a bit of hit these past few months as well. Both aren\u2019t growth sectors but typically offer companies with decent dividends and some stability. Not sure how to feel with either but I think they\u2019re better value plays than consumer staples at the moment. There is actually a fair deal of excitement going on in the telecom sector at the moment so it will be interesting how many of the companies in it play out. The concern with utilities is there with raising rates, limited growth, and high barriers to entry for new up and coming companies leaving the giants we all known for decades. I\u2019m currently at about 2% utilities and 3% telecom right now for allocations.\n\nThey\u2019re not at lows but I think healthcare and finance have a lot of potential and are decent sector buys. Healthcare was my bet for 2018\u2019s big winner but I\u2019ve been pretty wrong thus far this year with that one. A lot of pharmaceutical and biotech companies have been hit hard this year along with some other healthcare providers. I\u2019m amazed at how little banking has moved, I was thinking they would be performing far better by now this time of year but we still have six months until 2018 is finished. I\u2019ve been adding to both sectors since the end of last year along with upping my international exposure (specifically China). I\u2019m about 20% in each sector as far as portfolio allocation.\n\nEnergy had been hurting for years but showed some life earlier this year. I like it in my portfolio for diversification but I wouldn\u2019t want to be heavy in the sector. Just too much uncertainty and just when you think the sector is turning it around it goes backwards again. I do think the sector will eventually experience a nice run and reward patient investors or those who got in at the right time but you could argue lost opportunities from being in the sector while other sectors thrived reduce any rewards from it. Speculating on energy feels like blindly throwing darts at a board. I\u2019m around 6-7% on this one.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t touch them myself but a lot of precious metals funds and companies are down as well (yet again!). Just not my cup of tea but they are down and pretty beat. I\u2019m 0% precious metals.\n\nTech is, well, tech. The sector is highly valued at the moment and makes up a considerable chunk of the market and many funds (to a fault I\u2019d say). This is where a lot of money and nice returns are but with that comes the risk and volatility. We haven\u2019t seen too much of it besides a few blips in the radar but it\u2019s always there. Even with the high valuations, there are still a lot of really solid companies in the sector that are some of top and most powerful companies in the world. 2018 looks to be another year of strong growth for the sector. I\u2019m about 18% tech myself at the moment.\n\nReal estate/REITs are a real mixed bag right now. Some have done decently in 2018 while others have been absolutely destroyed. I think there are some nice bargains out there right now along with some other fairly valued companies in the sector. Raising rates, fear of an end to this bull market, the debt issues of many Americans, and a stop to the raising real estate prices has left some investors weary of the sector. Just know and understand what you\u2019re getting with most REITs: dividends, inefficient tax costs if not held in an tax advantaged account, and a unique form of stock diversity.\n\nMaterials and industrials are more or less where they started the year with some mild swings in 2018. Not sure how I feel about material sector, especially with things like the tariffs but I\u2019m fairly optimistic about industrials even though the sector is overvalued. There are some well established giants in the sector with huge MOATs and solid streams of revenue, a lot of them locked up in contracts with major companies or government entities.\n\nLast but not least are foreign holdings. Europe has taken quite a beating in the past but showed some exciting things. I think a lot of European funds are valued pretty fairly but I\u2019m hesitant to put any money in them for fear of stagnation and being vulnerable during any sort of recession, market crisis, or political instability. It\u2019s easy to forget that Europe isn\u2019t a country and instead a continent so there are a lot of factors involved and it\u2019s more complex than focusing on just a sole country or company. Emerging market funds look intriguing but they\u2019re true wild cards right now. I could see them finishing 2018 really strong or burning out really bad depending on the political climate and global market. I\u2019ve been putting some money in China myself and am increasing my international exposure from 15% with a goal of 25% by end of year. I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for Pacific region in terms of investing but they\u2019re been pretty slow in terms of growth/reward this year. Wouldn\u2019t touch anything in Africa or the Middle East. Just know it will be a wild ride with a lot of these international funds and companies.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. I think 2018 finishes strong as a whole market wise. Mid to late 2019 is where I\u2019m looking as far as my concerns go but that\u2019s of course a lot of speculating on my part.", "score": 7, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 7.0, "submission_title": "What industry or sector is at or near a low?", "submission_text": "Like oil in 2015, looking for a long term low or something at a cyclical bottom.", "parent_text": "What industry or sector is at or near a low?

They skyrocketed like the rest of the mark in 2016-2017 but I feel a lot of it was unwarranted and too much too fast. They did well but shouldn\u2019t have been traded as high as they were.\n\nTelecom and utilities have both taken a bit of hit these past few months as well. Both aren\u2019t growth sectors but typically offer companies with decent dividends and some stability. Not sure how to feel with either but I think they\u2019re better value plays than consumer staples at the moment. There is actually a fair deal of excitement going on in the telecom sector at the moment so it will be interesting how many of the companies in it play out. The concern with utilities is there with raising rates, limited growth, and high barriers to entry for new up and coming companies leaving the giants we all known for decades. I\u2019m currently at about 2% utilities and 3% telecom right now for allocations.\n\nThey\u2019re not at lows but I think healthcare and finance have a lot of potential and are decent sector buys. Healthcare was my bet for 2018\u2019s big winner but I\u2019ve been pretty wrong thus far this year with that one. A lot of pharmaceutical and biotech companies have been hit hard this year along with some other healthcare providers. I\u2019m amazed at how little banking has moved, I was thinking they would be performing far better by now this time of year but we still have six months until 2018 is finished. I\u2019ve been adding to both sectors since the end of last year along with upping my international exposure (specifically China). I\u2019m about 20% in each sector as far as portfolio allocation.\n\nEnergy had been hurting for years but showed some life earlier this year. I like it in my portfolio for diversification but I wouldn\u2019t want to be heavy in the sector. Just too much uncertainty and just when you think the sector is turning it around it goes backwards again. I do think the sector will eventually experience a nice run and reward patient investors or those who got in at the right time but you could argue lost opportunities from being in the sector while other sectors thrived reduce any rewards from it. Speculating on energy feels like blindly throwing darts at a board. I\u2019m around 6-7% on this one.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t touch them myself but a lot of precious metals funds and companies are down as well (yet again!). Just not my cup of tea but they are down and pretty beat. I\u2019m 0% precious metals.\n\nTech is, well, tech. The sector is highly valued at the moment and makes up a considerable chunk of the market and many funds (to a fault I\u2019d say). This is where a lot of money and nice returns are but with that comes the risk and volatility. We haven\u2019t seen too much of it besides a few blips in the radar but it\u2019s always there. Even with the high valuations, there are still a lot of really solid companies in the sector that are some of top and most powerful companies in the world. 2018 looks to be another year of strong growth for the sector. I\u2019m about 18% tech myself at the moment.\n\nReal estate/REITs are a real mixed bag right now. Some have done decently in 2018 while others have been absolutely destroyed. I think there are some nice bargains out there right now along with some other fairly valued companies in the sector. Raising rates, fear of an end to this bull market, the debt issues of many Americans, and a stop to the raising real estate prices has left some investors weary of the sector. Just know and understand what you\u2019re getting with most REITs: dividends, inefficient tax costs if not held in an tax advantaged account, and a unique form of stock diversity.\n\nMaterials and industrials are more or less where they started the year with some mild swings in 2018. Not sure how I feel about material sector, especially with things like the tariffs but I\u2019m fairly optimistic about industrials even though the sector is overvalued.

Commission on the sites I have been using is $6.95 per trade (round up to $7 for disucssion). I have a Robinhood account, but my core investments are based on DRIPs which Robinhood doesn't support. Over time I'm looking to have about 10 core positions and have about 20-30% of my investment in a broad market ETF. Overall I've been trying to keep commission cost to 1% of my total purchase (i.e. investing at least $700 per order). This makes it hard to dollar cost average and I've been finding myself trying to time the market too much. I have safety net savings already and a 401k I contribute to the max of my employer match, so this question is relevant to investment specifically as opposed to savings or retirement.\n\n**My proposed solution that I'd like opinions on**: Put the $100 away each month in my savings account. Then each quarter put the $300 + $100 from my 2k cash into the core position that has the best value based on my research. I would probably be looking to time this roughly at mid-January, April, July, and October.

Right now it's not a huge problem as all but one of my core holdings are under $300. So if it did become a problem in the future, it's a good problem to have.\n\n3) Does moving from montly to quarterly contributions take away too many of the benefits of dollar cost averaging? Is there a better middle ground to use?\n\n4) Does picking the best value stock at each investment period take away the benefits of dollar cost averaging? This is my biggest question overall.
