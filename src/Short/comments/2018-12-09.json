Reddit seems to only see it's content/cinema/marvel business.\n\nParks/ resorts. Media. Studio. Interactive. Consumer products.\n\nTheir diversification and synergy between each core revenue stream is holistic and self sustained. Parks/resorts has been out performing year over year, and helping to fund the other aspects of the business that aren't so profitable: media (abc and ESPN, and others) and also the studio which despite Marvel's wild success, still isn't significantly profitable yet. \n\nDuring a recession, parks and resorts (the real money maker) will decline, if there's a recession. But during a recession the synergy from media, studios with consumer products and interactive will turn into other revenue streams. Huly and the upcoming sports streaming service as well as the Disney channel will slowly turn into new and well built revenue streams. Slowly because it's Bob iger, well built because it's Bob iger. This synergy between media/consumer products/interactive/studio will become their 6th core business, streaming. If any of their highly diversified, yet boring businesses fail, the others will hold the structure up. In a recession their growth will be boring, but their long term capacity to stay afloat will be legendary. Over the past 5 years, Disney has underperformed the market, and I've seen my ventures in buying more DIS as buying bonds, or doubling down on the one true competitor to Netflix/hbo/Amazon prime streaming service/ and whatever crap Comcast puts out. Their first 1-2 years of integrating and implementing the streaming service will have roadblocks, but this isn't a short hold for me.\n\nAlso, where else will children and their parents go for original content?

I invested in AMZN in mid October 2017, that investment more than doubled in less than a year, I got in before the market started to crash, and lets be real y\u2019all the market is crashing right now, but that\u2019s a historical pattern. So my investment might end up right back where it first started, maybe maybe not, but I wouldn\u2019t pull out any of that investment unless I absolutely have to because I deem it to be a long term investment. So if you\u2019re going to invest, look at it as something you would be holding for more than a few years, investing in anything in life is a commitment which takes time, patience, good days and bad days and overtime you\u2019ll either see that investment grow and become what you hoped it to be if not even better or you don\u2019t and you change direction. So if you have enough money to put in to AMZN right now at the current market value then do it, but do it with a realistic expectation. I think one of the biggest misconceptions of the stock market is that it\u2019s fast money and people get really rich off of taking risks, that\u2019s not true, people who get rich from the stock market are typically long term investors who let their portfolio build over time, and view it as savings plan for their future, a lot of those people contrary to popular belief started out with hardly anything, but they kept moving forward with their goals and what they believed in, some people yes they do get rich fast from lucky investments but they are more often the exception to the rule, so are you intending to invest long term or are you expecting to make a lot of money in a short period of time?

I invested in AMZN in mid October 2017, that investment more than doubled in less than a year, I got in before the market started to crash, and lets be real y\u2019all the market is crashing right now, but that\u2019s a historical pattern. So my investment might end up right back where it first started, maybe maybe not, but I wouldn\u2019t pull out any of that investment unless I absolutely have to because I deem it to be a long term investment. So if you\u2019re going to invest, look at it as something you would be holding for more than a few years, investing in anything in life is a commitment which takes time, patience, good days and bad days and overtime you\u2019ll either see that investment grow and become what you hoped it to be if not even better or you don\u2019t and you change direction. So if you have enough money to put in to AMZN right now at the current market value then do it, but do it with a realistic expectation. I think one of the biggest misconceptions of the stock market is that it\u2019s fast money and people get really rich off of taking risks, that\u2019s not true, people who get rich from the stock market are typically long term investors who let their portfolio build over time, and view it as savings plan for their future, a lot of those people contrary to popular belief started out with hardly anything, but they kept moving forward with their goals and what they believed in, some people yes they do get rich fast from lucky investments but they are more often the exception to the rule, so are you intending to invest long term or are you expecting to make a lot of money in a short period of time?
