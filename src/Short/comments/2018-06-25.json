If it's a massive drop then it's the right decision all day long, but if it's only for a few % then it's a question of trying to maximise profits. When you're maximising profits then you start trying to time the markets and that's a dangerous tightrope to walk for an inexperienced investor.\n\nFor example, I got in with NVDA at $96 in 2016. If it's a dip down to where it is now that's not a big deal. But if we're seeing a massive correction that could bring it down to below $200 then that's really worrying.

But when clients ask you if we\u2019re going to have one ask then why they think that. They\u2019ll either say someone said it or PE is higher than it has been historically.\n-If they said someone said it, heard it on news ect...point out that we just had one recently barely 6months ago. And that we haven\u2019t had the short exponential growth that usually precedes a correction. So it\u2019s very unlikely.\n- if they say PE(which is an intelligent answer lol) point out the relationship between PE and risk free rate. High PE only signals a recession when the risk free rate and the equity risk premium are high. We\u2019re just starting to get raises in interest rate so it\u2019s natural that\u2019s stocks in general, specifically indexes like sp500, are inflated. As interest rises the PE will get closer to its historical mean. But due to likely never having more than 4% interest in the future, more tech stocks in the SP500, and the promotion of index funds, it\u2019s likely we will never go back to the historical average of 15-16 times earnings. \n\nSome people say that we have been in a 10 year bull run but if you play close attention there was a 5 month period during 2011 where the market dropped 19%. IMO that\u2019s a recession not a correction. But people ignore that to hype up the long bull. Either way we will have a bear market sometime eventually. But the opportunity cost of cashing out and waiting for a drop will 99% be greater than if you just stayed in the market in a well constructed portfolio. Even with the correction, if you would have bought the Sp a year ago you would have made 13% returns by now. \nLastly no matter what your opinion is on trump he won\u2019t be here forever.
