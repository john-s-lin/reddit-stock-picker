I\u2019ve accumulated this money by reselling cloths and saving up my lunch money I get for food everyday. I get around $12 every school day to buy lunch ending up to be 60 a week. My plan is to leave 20 left over at the end of every week so I can top up my investment my $10 and save $10 dollars. The 10 I save is for back up money for if I ever really need it, but the long term goal is to keep it for when I\u2019m adult. And the same goes for the money I want to invest. Make in initial vestment of $370 and top it up $10 every week till I\u2019m 18. This is just a plan I\u2019ve made for myself so I can have money in the stock market and see how it works. When I become older I will be investing a lot more but this is just a tester. I\u2019m inspired by Warren Buffet and I think it\u2019s very interesting how you can turn your money into much more buy putting it into a company. I find school interesting (when we are actually learning) but there are some things that I\u2019m dying to know but school does not have all the answers! I\u2019ve been thinking about buying a B share in Berkshire Hathaway as of writing this it\u2019s $214. I think this is a good safe long term investment that I can hold onto for a while. This is what I think is a good investment for the research I\u2019ve done online so far. I put 5 dollars a month out of my allowance to a super ( I know it\u2019s very early to be thinking about retirement but I call it a head start).  I\u2019m reading an Australian book called the Barefoot Investor and it\u2019s giving me good tips on how I should spend my money and save it. What I want to know is some advice on what to spend my money on in the stock market. I\u2019m also just looking for new ways I can invest that $10 a week on things other then stocks.

I would go with one of the robot advisors like WealthFront or Betterment. The reason I recommend this is due to the size of your initial investment ($370) and subsequent top off amount ($10).  Especially with $10, you will be pressed to find names worth investing in. With the robo advisors mentioned above, they provide multiple advantages, most importantly partial share buys. Meaning if you put $10, they can get you 0.005 share of AMZN. This enables you to immediately put your money to work, rather than have it idle for weeks/months until something decent can be bought in one \u201cfull share\u201d. Aside from that, they do automatic dividend reinvesting and take action on your account to provide you with the best tax advantage. And finally their fees are relatively low.\n\nIf I got you correctly, you come of as a guy who wants to be hands on and wants to learn by investing your money. For that i advice you to open a practice account with any major broker. You will get $500k-1M in play money while practicing in real life market conditions.

I\u2019m reading an Australian book called the Barefoot Investor and it\u2019s giving me good tips on how I should spend my money and save it. What I want to know is some advice on what to spend my money on in the stock market. I\u2019m also just looking for new ways I can invest that $10 a week on things other then stocks. Any books you would recommend to a young investor. Anything will help!\n  \n\n\nNote: I posted this on the investing sub reddit but I think it got taken down. A lot of the comments were addressing how I should keep my money and save it. I have $400 in a saving account that is separate from the 370 I want to invest. And a lot of the comments were talking about how I should put the 370 into a lawn mower or some thing that that will help me make money, well I do have something. I have $230 that I buy cloths and sneakers with and sell them for more money so I do have another source of income besides my lunch money. I also live in NYC so I don\u2019t think buying a lawn mower would be so effective. Also people were saying enjoy being a kid and I do I hang out with my friends a lot and we do not constantly talk about money and stocks. This investment is a trail run, I just want to get into the habit of investing my money and saving it. I\u2019m going to try and get as much knowledge as possible by reading books and asking people around me who I think could help. This means when I get more money from reselling or when I turn 14 and get a job I will be able to invest a larger sum of money knowing what I\u2019m doing.

And a lot of the comments were talking about how I should put the 370 into a lawn mower or some thing that that will help me make money, well I do have something. I have $230 that I buy cloths and sneakers with and sell them for more money so I do have another source of income besides my lunch money. I also live in NYC so I don\u2019t think buying a lawn mower would be so effective.

Getting these through the FDA is a long, long, arduous and expensive process. But finally, we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Diseases that have long since been written off as having no cure or only mediocre therapies have legitimate, real potential for functional cures.\n\n\nPeople like biotech for a few other reasons:\n\n-The FDA has a very standardized drug application and phasing system that is relatively easy to follow. The game is to extrapolate what you are seeing in early phases to make educated bets on drugs or therapies that will make it through and have an impact in the industry. Not many drugs make it through all the way to phase 3 - so it can be quite risky, but that means big reward as well.\n\n-You can't put a pricetag on health. Imagine if you had cancer, were blind, losing a limb, etc - How much would you pay to prevent that?\n\n-Boomers are in the later stages of life now and will spend increasingly more on healthcare than anything we've seen in this country to date. \n\n\nI personally feel strongly about the next coming successes of the RNAI field being ripe as hell. Take a look at ARWR and the HepB therapy in P1/2 making big waves. I will probably slowly move into CRISPR tech in 3-5 years - this is a more complicated therapy then RNAI and believe it will take a bit more time to work out the last kinks.\n\n", "score": 8, "num_replies": 3, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 2.6666666666666665, "submission_title": "Why biotechnology stocks?", "submission_text": "I can't really understand properly why do people suggest on investing in biotechnology stocks, what has changed so dramatically?\n\nI don't know if it is, but people are giving me the vibe that biotechnology stocks are gonna have the same jumps like in technology stocks in the last ~10 years (more specifically Amazon, netflix...)

FB will provide greater long-term appreciation opportunity than the average company 2. FB isn't overpriced relative to the discounted value of it's future cashflows. Facebook has moats, upon moats, but Facebook has an important edge that I feel no other company in the world has. (Almost) Everyone is on there, and it's easy to share things with friends. This will allow it to deploy any new internet based product directly in the feed, and allow for it to gain popularity fairly quickly through people sharing with others on their friendlist.\n\nTwo examples: FB has started to step into Hulu and Netflix's territory with shows on FB watch like Sacred lies. Netflix and FB can both put out quality content, but Netflix doesn't have the edge in people sharing shows they like with friends. It takes 1 second to click share, and some percentage of the up to 5000 friends on your friendlist can see the episode. FB also has groups for each show where fans can bond with other fans over the show. Netflix doesn't have this ability, at least directly under their control\n\nAnother is gaming streams, where FB is attacking companies like twitch. They have an edge for the same reason above. They're also hosting live sports now.  \n\n\nEventually I think there will be an streaming parity with many companies putting out high quality entertainment series/streams, but no company (disney, amazon, netflix, hulu) will have that same edge in making discussion, and sharing easily available like FB will.\n\nFB fell partly because investments in making in these sorts of things. I agree that it lowers the value near term, but in the long term FB is making the time people spend on FB more valuable by providing things that users WANT to share/talk about.\n\nPlus there's stuff with Instagram, Oculus, and etc", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "What are our next moves with FB?", "submission_text": "Holding FB, want to trade it all for SALESFORCE, but don\u2019t want to sell FB at a loss.
