I personally wouldn't rely on a forward PE for a growth stock due to the factors that can quickly change. In recent, their growth has slowed which has caused a slight pullback, but they're still growing.. fast too just not as fast as before. Their PE is currently 48 or so - high but not as high as a lot of other growth stocks out there.

I believe a FB rebound is highly likely within the next 6 months, while I'm uncertain about the China situation. \n\nFB had -19% free cash flow last quarter, largely due to increased investment in privacy controls and other growth areas. This, combined with multiple instances of negative publicity, has driven the stock down. There is short term uncertainty for FB right now is due to these factors, and as a result investors are pricing the stock based on conservative metrics such as free cash flow instead of metrics related to future growth potential. To put it simply, privacy issues led to increased investment in privacy controls which led to less free cash flow which led to lower stock price. That's my over simplified thesis. Zucky is playing for the long term, and at these prices, I'm playing along with him, because I don't believe there is much more downside. If it does go down, I'm not worried, unless it's due to new factors that I'm not aware of.\n\nJD and BABA on the other hand, has uncertainty hovering around it for the foreseeable future. Between the departure of Jack Ma and an unpredictable political climate, I believe BABA's share price is largely at the mercy of political factors, at least until a trade deal is signed or Trump leaves office.

But here are some things people look at when trying to answer that question:\n\n1. **Has Microsoft become overvalued?** This is subjective but some common things people look at: Price to earnings (Microsoft trades at a P/E of 30 compared to 18x at Apple), price to sales (8 x at Microsoft compared to 4x at Apple) and price to book (10 compared to 9). So growth is definitely priced into Microsoft stock price. Determining if a stock is overvalued is the job of thousands of professionals so I can't realistically tell you if it's overvalued, but you can look at factors like revenue and earnings growth and return on equity and operating margin to paint a picture yourself.\n2. **Will Microsoft continue to grow at the rate I've seen it grow at?** Personally I think Microsoft's investment in the Cloud with Azure (second behind AWS), a really fucking good product in the Surface tablet, and their core office products will allow them to grow continuously at their current rate. I also believe they've made smart investments in vertical integration and I really think they could tie together everything really nicely if they could migrate consumers over the way they've done with business.
