Most notably they repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 which separated commercial and investment banks.   \n2. This led to commercial banks issuing tons of risky sub-prime mortgages and using them as the derivatives to sell bonds/mortgage backed securities for investment banks who turned around and sold them to investors. Despite knowing that these mortgages were in fact garbage these banks took advantage of investor's trust and filled tons of high rated bonds with them. \n3. When people started inevitably defaulting on their sub-prime mortgages which were the underlying derivative for these bonds, the bonds lost all of their value. This started a domino effect that destroyed the stock market\n\nTLDR: Banks deregulated great depression era separation of commercial and investment banks.

Banks were not careful on mortgage loans. Early 2000\u2019s had a new model called \u201coriginate and distribute\u201d wherein banks held the loans for a few days then sold them to investment bankers; the investment bankers then reorganized these mortgages and issued mortgage backed securities, or derivative bonds. These securities needed payments of interest and principle on the mortgage in order to pay the mortgage backed bonds. \n\nHowever, the payments were not made mainly because of looser lending standards; the banks did not care if the borrower was credit worthy, because they would just sell these mortgages to an investment bank a few days later. As a result, banks lended money to strippers, hobos, and general idiots. \n\nAs for who will get the blame this time around, I really can not say. We just have to wait and see. \n\n", "parent_score": 0, "parent_ratio": -999}, {"time": 1542721529.0, "submission_id": "9ys0mq", "comment_id": "ea3lvcg", "body": "No, the banks didn't properly account for risks.

Several large investment groups have bought a lions share of the current stock and are sitting on it.

With the current drop trend nearing what I'm assuming might be a flat for a while I'm crossing my fingers that it will start to climb again sometime towards mid to late February. To be  honest I'm playing it by what I perceive the market doing after petroleum demands spike for the cold months and  the hopefully renewed interest in US oil production resulting from foreign companies flexing nuts and manipulating the global market. I'm kinda shooting in the dark at this since I've literally been trading less than 3 months now. My portfolio has been losing significantly, but I also have to remind myself daily that 85% of my investments are long term, which can be frustrating.

The first is that online banks don\u2019t have the costs of building, maintaining, and running brick and mortar locations. Whatever money saved from not having these buildings can be paid back to the customer via higher rates. The second reason companies like BOA offer lower rates is simply because they can. They are one of the largest, most powerful, and influential banks out there. They have a huge customer base that go to them for reasons such as name recognition, ease of access/accessibility of banks/ATMs, and because you\u2019re way more likely to see and deal with them regularly than you are with an online bank like say Ally. Some people want to go with a bank they\u2019re familiar with or they their parents used. Others want the ability to be able to walk into a bank and talk with someone or be able to find a ATM within minutes. Some people like having all their things (checking, savings, credit card, mortgage, etc.) all with one bank, which a company as large as BOA offers whereas an online bank may only offer some of these things.
