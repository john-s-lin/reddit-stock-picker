It's not really a descriptive category in 2018. I view the 4 companies you mentioned completely differently. Apple is a phone company. Amazon/Microsoft are cloud service companies (with a few hobbies). Google is a media/advertising company.\n\n\nNow with that new perspective, it's much easier to evaluate where those companies are in their life cycles. I'll speak directly about Google, since I feel the most comfortable/familiar with the advertising industry. As of 2018, according to eMarketer, about 35% of ad dollars in the US are still being spent on TV. About 37% is being spent on digital. I believe that digital media companies will actually own almost 100% of consumer attention in the near future. Think NFLX, GOOG (YouTube/YouTube TV), FB (Instagram), etc. Therefore, if my belief holds true, and advertisers want to be where the attention is, then theoretically, there is still at least room for 35% more growth in revenue for the tech stocks. And that's just the US. Add into that consideration that these advertising companies have massive global scale. The upside become very clear. \n\n\nFOMO might be the initial motivation for looking into these companies, but temper that instinct with some additional research and thinking to lead to a sound conclusion.

I do still have one that specializes in small outlets usually anchored by grocery stores but malls I avoid.\n\nThe beauty of REITs is that there are so many different types.  Right now I like apartment REITs, office building/warehouse REITs, hotel REITs.  I have dramatically thinned my health care REITs.  With a REIT in a dividend reinvestment set up plowing your 6-7% back into more shares, you can grow your positions quickly.  My Roth IRA is all REITs, many monthly payers and all of them are DRIPed.
