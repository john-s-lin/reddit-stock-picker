Likely using left/right selectors on digital mannequins, like an MMO character creator. This would default to a blank white mannequin. If they could put their clothing for demo on more realistic mannequins, all the better.

Something like Five Four Club, but with the backing of a previously established, well known, and respectable brand.\n\nGoing this route, the company would be shrunk, reducing its overhead drastically. Very few, or no physical locations. A lot of jobs would be lost, and that would suck, but new jobs would be created in digital areas, such as web and app design, as well as marketing.\n\nTo remain publicly significant after going heavily digital, they would need to start some sort of JC Penney fashion show/competition and overhaul their public interactions. Show off the brand and say \"We're still here. We still do these great things. We sell our clothing digitally now.

I wouldn't even focus on the young people, so many people are doing that now. \n\n* Complete overhaul of outfits and accessories. Not clothes that appeal to the young, but clothes that appeal to people overall, regardless of age. LuLaRoe, despite being a dying MLM is actually pretty smart about this. Their clothes isn't just for a group of women, but it's across all-age demographics (for Christian women I may add). I think appealing to a large demographic is what they need, while clothes still say modern.\n\n* Bigger presence in E-commerce scene. This will be explained more later on.\n\n* Cheaper prices and better deals that can sway people from Amazon. One of the main reasons why people have jumped to Amazon was because it was cheaper to find what you want there than it would in a brick-and-mortar store. Think about it, Amazon really got popular during the Recession. Why?  It was cheaper than traditional retail stores, and people saved on gas.\n\n* JCPenney's new clothing line available only online.

I'll cut down the amount of stores we limiting the JCPenney's brand to just a handful of major cities, whilst making these stores in a distribution centers as well.\n\n* Center our headquarters in New York where fashion live, this way, we can become a big force in the industry.\n\n* Better customer service in-store.\n\n\nWell, these are my ideas.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 105, "submission_ratio": 0.009523809523809525, "submission_title": "If you were the CEO of JCPenney, what would be your strategy to turn the company around?", "submission_text": "It seems to me their Sephora partnership ( store within a store) along with women accessories and clothing are what keeps this company afloat in the short term.

A GFS of hospitality is probably needed in a lot of downtown locations since people may want to simplify and concentrate their purchases of those goods.  This could be a place of future growth.  Translate Groupon's model for stores locally (As it translates into the coupon of online and creates a draw and attention to JC Penny the brand - People need constant reminders and it allows those who get mentally stimulated by a good deal to want to engage in branding).  Something like getting a shipment of shoes and then putting it at a discount when it arrives and people purchase it online for a discount and limit the amounts that people can buy (Amazon kind of does it but allow them to immediately pick it up in the store).  That was the original niche market that JC Penny had but then they wanted to simplify the coupons not realizing that the coupons were the advertising for the company.  Creating an online presence per store discounts could allow for free advertising to keep the brand in the minds of those who love good deals.  Limiting it per box or only having so many at a specific price would also attract attention to the company.  H&M became what Apple's operations officer wanted JC Penny to be as that is the everyday low prices.  JC Penny can bring it back by creating and targeting those people who want a good deal online.  \n\nI don't think that they can easily turn themselves around and Buffett has said that it is nearly impossible for a retail chain to turnaround and hasn't seen one do it.  I would use though for JC Penny the YUM brand strategy where you buy up and also organically grow retail chains like Hibbett sports, H&M, Fossil even, or any other Strip mall or regular mall business.  Basically, have a portfolio of retail chains, use the strategies of consolidating the industry of outlets and brand names.  I don't know of any kind of retail mall business that does this currently but it is everywhere in business even the glasses company.  That would and easily could bring them back to where they need to be as Amazon is kind of stealing the marketshare for a lot of these companies.  Logistically, there isn't going to be an easy way to compete with the likes of Amazon and Malls alone and there needs to be consolidation in the industry either way.  The biggest thing too is to create a brand building strategy for stores like Disney has for Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm.  Have a store strategy that can identify unmet needs and then implementing them is a big one.  For example, I am surprised at how smart Gamestop was to add toys that cater to gamers and fanboys.  I am shocked though that they don't completely cater to fanboys like adding comics or comic book subscriptions and ignoring something that Toys R us ignored which kept the majority of high ticket items that fans of transformers would pay 150 dollars to buy (My brother is one of those) or a legend of Zelda Link that is fully articulated.  Then provide a comic book subscription or even buy it there or a notification to specific products that they would be a major fan of.  The only problem though is the buying of companies as many overstate their stuff but making a Yum brands of retail stores is probably they best way for them to get back on their feet if there was a way to do it.
