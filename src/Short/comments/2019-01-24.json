Also, due to regulations, for the purposes of calculating both margin requirement AND borrow rate, your broker must charge you as if each share trades at a minimum of $1.\n\nSo for example, if you're shorting a penny stock worth $0.25, your margin requirement AND borrow rate are 4x higher than what it should be. Add on to the possibility of it being a crowded short, and you could be looking at paying 360% annual rates.\n\nThis is not a theoretical example. My last short I was paying 90% rate cuz it was so damn crowded, and I shorted it from $0.365 to $0.30. Even tho I made 18%, and I only held the position for 7 days, those 7 days costed me 7.5% of profit from an implied borrow rate of 360%/year.

You know EU Migrants contribute far more to the treasury than they take out, so their presence here increases public finances enabling things such as public services and new homes?\n\nFor the record, I'm fairly supportive of open border immigration with most of Europe. What I will say is that I find a lot of the studies regarding the effect EU migration has on wages and their net contribution flawed. If you need an example of this, just look at the NHS. It's staffed by large numbers by EU migrants. Why do you think this is? Do you honestly think it's just that the British public no longer want to be nurses? I'd argue it's because the government can get away with paying nurses terrible wages because they know EU migrants will do the job anyway. The same thing is happening in farming and other sectors too. When there are skill shortages we no longer need worry about training our own workforce. Why would you? Education is expensive and Brits expect high wages. Plus there is an unlimited supply of cheap labour... It's a no brainer.\n\nAs for public services, the main reason EU migrants are so good for public finances is because the migrants who come here are working age and we don't have to educate them because we can effectively rip off the Eastern European tax payer. This is becoming a large problem in many Eastern Europe countries notably countries like Latvia who have lost almost a third of their population in recent decades mostly due to their skilled workers (who's education was paid for by Latvians) coming to countries like the UK where they can receive better pay.\n\nIf you want to link a study I'm happy to review it though. It's easier for me to refute an argument when I have some specifics to address. But again, I didn't personally vote Brexit because of immigration or wages, I was just providing a point of view many people, I think rightly, have.\n\n> When the pie shrinks why do you start asking who you share slices with and not why the pie has become smaller? Do you consider that those who shrink the pie have no vested interest correcting this belief?\n\nWho are we talking about here?

This is one of the reasons Turkey imminently becoming a Member is a myth.\n\nOkay, but this isn't enough. Why doesn't the USA and Canada enter a political and fiscal union by this logic? The USA and Canada might agree on many things but they're so different in so many ways uniting politically wouldn't be good for either nation.\n\nAlso Turkey joining wasn't \"a myth\".

You know EU Migrants contribute far more to the treasury than they take out, so their presence here increases public finances enabling things such as public services and new homes?\n\nFor the record, I'm fairly supportive of open border immigration with most of Europe. What I will say is that I find a lot of the studies regarding the effect EU migration has on wages and their net contribution flawed. If you need an example of this, just look at the NHS. It's staffed by large numbers by EU migrants. Why do you think this is? Do you honestly think it's just that the British public no longer want to be nurses? I'd argue it's because the government can get away with paying nurses terrible wages because they know EU migrants will do the job anyway. The same thing is happening in farming and other sectors too. When there are skill shortages we no longer need worry about training our own workforce. Why would you? Education is expensive and Brits expect high wages. Plus there is an unlimited supply of cheap labour... It's a no brainer.\n\nAs for public services, the main reason EU migrants are so good for public finances is because the migrants who come here are working age and we don't have to educate them because we can effectively rip off the Eastern European tax payer. This is becoming a large problem in many Eastern Europe countries notably countries like Latvia who have lost almost a third of their population in recent decades mostly due to their skilled workers (who's education was paid for by Latvians) coming to countries like the UK where they can receive better pay.\n\nIf you want to link a study I'm happy to review it though. It's easier for me to refute an argument when I have some specifics to address. But again, I didn't personally vote Brexit because of immigration or wages, I was just providing a point of view many people, I think rightly, have.\n\n> When the pie shrinks why do you start asking who you share slices with and not why the pie has become smaller? Do you consider that those who shrink the pie have no vested interest correcting this belief?\n\nWho are we talking about here? The rich, our politicians?\n\n> You cite political differences yet countries are only permitted to join to the EU if they meet the accession criteria which includes \u201cstability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities\u201d. EU Membership necessarily means countries have the ground rules of democracy in place, and so more in common politically with us than most of the rest of the world. This is one of the reasons Turkey imminently becoming a Member is a myth.\n\nOkay, but this isn't enough. Why doesn't the USA and Canada enter a political and fiscal union by this logic? The USA and Canada might agree on many things but they're so different in so many ways uniting politically wouldn't be good for either nation.\n\nAlso Turkey joining wasn't \"a myth\". It very well could have happened and was even on course to happen until recently...\n\n> With fiscal rules, let\u2019s be honest unless you critique specific rules your statement is a pretty vague platitude. The basic rule of budgetary policy in EU treaties is aimed at ensuring Member States avoid excessive government deficits. It\u2019s intended to avoid another Greece. EU rules control things such as preventing financial institutions\u2019 assets from exceeding their liabilities by a certain margin so we don\u2019t get another 2008. They control things such as asset liquidity. Sure, you might think such constraints are terrible, but 2008 showed that domestic governments aren\u2019t always that fantastic at being self-regulatory.\n\nI don't even know what your argument is here? Are you telling me the EU is more capable of drafting financial regulation for the UK than the UK is? Why would that be?

When economic agents act in the private sector, they put a value on things based on the objects percieved utility. These market transactions are normally very allocatively efficient as both parties are using their own scarce resources with their own value system. When this process is handed over to a third party the outcome is normally much more allocatively inefficient. As a third party does not have a profit motive to make efficient decisions and nor are the third parties values all ways the same. Imagine if on your street every household gave the household next door their weekly shopping allowance and told their neighbours to do their weekly shop for them. The outcome would be the job 'would be done' but would it be allocatively efficient? Maybe your neighboor forgot you were lactose intolerant?This is what mises calls the economic calcultion problem and Westminster let alone the EU does this way too much in my eyes.\n\nThis is not to say we do not need a state, it is just to say we do not need a state or EU that tries to micro manage the economy by creating 'economic development' in certain areas by taking money from taxpayes and giving it to special interests.\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 219, "submission_ratio": 0.0045662100456621, "submission_title": "'Don't listen to the Brexiteers' madness,' says Airbus CEO who is threatening to pull out of the UK entirely over Brexit (Business Insider)", "submission_text": "The CEO of French aviation giant Airbus has warned that the company could be forced to pull investments from the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit outcome.\n\nSuch a move could impact tens of thousands of jobs and cost the British economy billions, CEO Tom Enders said in a video message.\n\n\"If there is a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK,\" he said.\n\nMore: https://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-ceo-threatens-to-pull-out-of-uk-over-madness-of-brexit-2019-1", "parent_text": "If there was a point i made that was wrong or you dont agree with you can post a counter argument and explain why that is wrong.
