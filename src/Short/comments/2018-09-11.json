Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235272518_Market_Reaction_to_the_Expiration_of_IPO_Lockup_Provisions [accessed Sep 11 2018].\n\n>5. ConclusionThis study addresses the stock market reaction at and around IPO lockup expirationsusing a large sample of IPOs that span the time period 1988 - 1998. Overall, we find that the expiration of share lockups for IPOs has important share-price implications. Thenegative abnormal returns at the lockup expiration date are consistent with theoreticalpredictions based on informational asymmetries and decreased incentive alignmentbetween insiders and general shareholders. The returns are also consistent with numerouspractitioner claims. These results are intriguing because the lockup expiration date ispublic information, yet significant abnormal returns occur in the days just prior to and onthe expiration of the lockup date. The results of the cross-sectional regression shed lighton characteristics that affect market returns around the lockup expiration date. In general,we find evidence that greater uncertainty about insiders\u2019 future actions (i.e., asymmetricinformation) is related to negative abnormal returns. Model characteristics that proxy forinformation availability and that are statistically significant are the proportion of shares inlockup and firm size.

Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235272518_Market_Reaction_to_the_Expiration_of_IPO_Lockup_Provisions [accessed Sep 11 2018].\n\n>5. ConclusionThis study addresses the stock market reaction at and around IPO lockup expirationsusing a large sample of IPOs that span the time period 1988 - 1998. Overall, we find that the expiration of share lockups for IPOs has important share-price implications. Thenegative abnormal returns at the lockup expiration date are consistent with theoreticalpredictions based on informational asymmetries and decreased incentive alignmentbetween insiders and general shareholders. The returns are also consistent with numerouspractitioner claims. These results are intriguing because the lockup expiration date ispublic information, yet significant abnormal returns occur in the days just prior to and onthe expiration of the lockup date. The results of the cross-sectional regression shed lighton characteristics that affect market returns around the lockup expiration date. In general,we find evidence that greater uncertainty about insiders\u2019 future actions (i.e., asymmetricinformation) is related to negative abnormal returns. Model characteristics that proxy forinformation availability and that are statistically significant are the proportion of shares inlockup and firm size.
