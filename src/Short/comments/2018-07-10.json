Because Jim Cramer has branded himself as  a great investor? He does not even beat the market: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13\n\nI would like to provide here some excerpts from a book I read recently that happened to discuss Jim Cramer. Pages 73-75 of \"The Entrepreneurial Investor\" by Orfalea et al. (2008) (ISBN 978-0-470-22714-5):\n\n> Years ago, the Second City Television (SCTV) comedy show featured a sketch promoting a home dentistry kit. \u201cSince you\u2019re not licensed to give yourself shots of Novocain,\u201d explains the host, \u201csubstitute shots of tequila.\u201d He then consumes mass quantities of tequila and, using drills and mirrors, drunkenly fills his own cavities, with periodic screams of pain. Many people take the same approach to investing, except that instead of tequila, they numb themselves with mass quantities of \u201cexpert\u201d advice from books, web pages, newspapers, radio, and television talk shows. Then they invest, with periodic screams of pain.\n\n> We have no doubt that most people possess the intelligence to manage their own investments; as this book demonstrates, the concepts are simple. But most people lack the time, discipline, and emotional detachment necessary for effective investing, so they seek shortcuts in the guise of actionable advice. It has been reported that stocks featured on Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money  television show increase in price soon after the show, only to retreat within a few days. This suggests that a number of people are acting impulsively on televised investment advice. The popular investment advice out there, despite generally good quality, is no substitute for personal, professional investment advice.\n\n> Guilty Pleasure\n\n> Over the years, television\u2019s attempts to cover business and investing have ranged from the wry, thoughtful wit of the late Louis Rukeyser to the manic, Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse approach of Cramer. Generally, television cannot afford the time to study any issue in depth, and equity investing is no exception. Moreover, the programming needs of television imbue most investing shows with an anxiety-inducing need to present something new every day. This leads many viewers to the very bad habit of excessive trading. This is no surprise. The average investor, managing his or her own portfolio, operates in a trade-obsessed universe. Online and discount brokerages promote the cost of trades as their primary selling point. There is a lot more to investing than trading, but trading is a key source of revenue on Wall Street, a conflict of interest left over from the days when giant stockbrokers roamed the earth. Much of the information reaching investors emphasizes the mechanics of buying and selling stock based on trends of the market. Products and services for investors are biased toward this technical analysis of price trends rather than fundamental analysis of a company\u2019s value. It\u2019s useful information, but it\u2019s no substitute for an investment philosophy and process. It\u2019s also no substitute for hands-on research. Opportunities come in different shapes and sizes and are often missed by investors unwilling to kick the tires or get their hands dirty.\n\n> Commanders, Teachers, and Mentors\n\n> Money magazine editor-at-large Jean Chatzky wrote in her June 26, 2006, column, \u201c. . . experts screaming about your money may make for good TV, but it doesn\u2019t always work one-on-one.\u201d She pointed out that television personalities like Jim Cramer and Suze Orman are \u201cpart of a recent American fascination with being told just how wrong we are, by the likes of Simon Cowell, Judge Judy, and Ann Coulter.\u201d One expert interviewed by Chatzky suggests there are two primary types of financial advisers: commanders and teachers. Commanders, which include aggressive shouters like Cramer and Orman, tell you what to do and expect you to do it with no questions asked. Teachers, on the other hand, walk you through the process and attempt to ensure your understanding. Teachers are considered the superior choice, but Chatzky concedes that commanders are popular because their style simply works better for some people.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Simple Concepts, Difficult Execution\n\n> Warren Buffett\u2019s extremely successful investing style requires deep knowledge of a company before funds are committed, and his new investments make news because they are so infrequent. Consider the research required to know a company\u2019s assets (including potentially under- or overvalued real estate; for example, there are railroads and oil companies that own massive tracts of land that have been on their books for decades, at the original price!), whether the stock price is a bargain (understanding the present value of future cash flows, with all the assumptions that entails), and what potential catalysts might cause the stock price to increase (supply and demand; Food and Drug Administration approvals; new patents; social, political, demographic changes). As we often say, investing is simple, but not easy.\n\n> But in one interview, Jim Cramer is quoted as saying, \u201cI follow about 1,000 stocks closely, and there\u2019s another 500 or 1,000 I keep an eye on.\u201d Closely? Maybe Cramer means he follows the stock price closely. On the show, dozens of stocks are mentioned, and he has an opinion on every one. But where\u2019s the expertise? Does he really know all the underlying information on the company, or does he just have an opinion on the price?", "score": 7, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 7.0, "submission_title": "Does anyone know anything about Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS and if its worth the $300 an annual subscription?", "submission_text": "Though Jim Cramer is one of the greatest investors his Action Alerts PLUS is way too expensive at $300 for annual subscription.

Anyone members of the action alert plus or know if its worth getting? Or does anyone have another service that they enjoy and is worth looking into? Thanks! ", "parent_text": "> Though Jim Cramer is one of the greatest investors \n\nWhy do you think so? Because Jim Cramer has branded himself as  a great investor? He does not even beat the market: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13\n\nI would like to provide here some excerpts from a book I read recently that happened to discuss Jim Cramer. Pages 73-75 of \"The Entrepreneurial Investor\" by Orfalea et al. (2008) (ISBN 978-0-470-22714-5):\n\n> Years ago, the Second City Television (SCTV) comedy show featured a sketch promoting a home dentistry kit. \u201cSince you\u2019re not licensed to give yourself shots of Novocain,\u201d explains the host, \u201csubstitute shots of tequila.\u201d He then consumes mass quantities of tequila and, using drills and mirrors, drunkenly fills his own cavities, with periodic screams of pain. Many people take the same approach to investing, except that instead of tequila, they numb themselves with mass quantities of \u201cexpert\u201d advice from books, web pages, newspapers, radio, and television talk shows. Then they invest, with periodic screams of pain.\n\n> We have no doubt that most people possess the intelligence to manage their own investments; as this book demonstrates, the concepts are simple. But most people lack the time, discipline, and emotional detachment necessary for effective investing, so they seek shortcuts in the guise of actionable advice. It has been reported that stocks featured on Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money  television show increase in price soon after the show, only to retreat within a few days. This suggests that a number of people are acting impulsively on televised investment advice. The popular investment advice out there, despite generally good quality, is no substitute for personal, professional investment advice.\n\n> Guilty Pleasure\n\n> Over the years, television\u2019s attempts to cover business and investing have ranged from the wry, thoughtful wit of the late Louis Rukeyser to the manic, Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse approach of Cramer. Generally, television cannot afford the time to study any issue in depth, and equity investing is no exception. Moreover, the programming needs of television imbue most investing shows with an anxiety-inducing need to present something new every day. This leads many viewers to the very bad habit of excessive trading. This is no surprise. The average investor, managing his or her own portfolio, operates in a trade-obsessed universe. Online and discount brokerages promote the cost of trades as their primary selling point. There is a lot more to investing than trading, but trading is a key source of revenue on Wall Street, a conflict of interest left over from the days when giant stockbrokers roamed the earth. Much of the information reaching investors emphasizes the mechanics of buying and selling stock based on trends of the market. Products and services for investors are biased toward this technical analysis of price trends rather than fundamental analysis of a company\u2019s value. It\u2019s useful information, but it\u2019s no substitute for an investment philosophy and process. It\u2019s also no substitute for hands-on research. Opportunities come in different shapes and sizes and are often missed by investors unwilling to kick the tires or get their hands dirty.\n\n> Commanders, Teachers, and Mentors\n\n> Money magazine editor-at-large Jean Chatzky wrote in her June 26, 2006, column, \u201c. . . experts screaming about your money may make for good TV, but it doesn\u2019t always work one-on-one.\u201d She pointed out that television personalities like Jim Cramer and Suze Orman are \u201cpart of a recent American fascination with being told just how wrong we are, by the likes of Simon Cowell, Judge Judy, and Ann Coulter.\u201d One expert interviewed by Chatzky suggests there are two primary types of financial advisers: commanders and teachers. Commanders, which include aggressive shouters like Cramer and Orman, tell you what to do and expect you to do it with no questions asked. Teachers, on the other hand, walk you through the process and attempt to ensure your understanding. Teachers are considered the superior choice, but Chatzky concedes that commanders are popular because their style simply works better for some people.\n\n> [...]\n\n> Simple Concepts, Difficult Execution\n\n> Warren Buffett\u2019s extremely successful investing style requires deep knowledge of a company before funds are committed, and his new investments make news because they are so infrequent. Consider the research required to know a company\u2019s assets (including potentially under- or overvalued real estate; for example, there are railroads and oil companies that own massive tracts of land that have been on their books for decades, at the original price!), whether the stock price is a bargain (understanding the present value of future cash flows, with all the assumptions that entails), and what potential catalysts might cause the stock price to increase (supply and demand; Food and Drug Administration approvals; new patents; social, political, demographic changes). As we often say, investing is simple, but not easy.\n\n> But in one interview, Jim Cramer is quoted as saying, \u201cI follow about 1,000 stocks closely, and there\u2019s another 500 or 1,000 I keep an eye on.\u201d Closely? Maybe Cramer means he follows the stock price closely. On the show, dozens of stocks are mentioned, and he has an opinion on every one. But where\u2019s the expertise? Does he really know all the underlying information on the company, or does he just have an opinion on the price?", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.42857142857142855}, {"time": 1531715950.0, "submission_id": "8xos2p", "comment_id": "e2gs0du", "body": "See to him his television show is a game.

They start to buy the $11 calls in large quantities, but the stock price itself doesn't move. \n\nDemand for the $11 call has increased, so the price of the contract should increase right? But how could that happen if the stock price is unchanged? The answer is that the IV changes.\n\nLet's say that all those buyers bid the $11 call up to $1.00. The gain from $0.50 to $1 comes purely from IV inflation, since the stock didn't move.\n\nEssentially, IV is a mechanism that allows an option's price to float freely with supply and demand without being tethered directly to the price of the underlying.", "score": 4, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 4.0, "submission_title": "What are some good ways of thinking about Implied Volatility?", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "What are some good ways of thinking about Implied Volatility?

Basically a $100 stock with 20% IV tells you that it can move from 80 to 120 in 1 standard deviation.  40% would expand the same stock to 60 to 140.\n\nIV will also increase option prices.  So buying options when a stocks IV is low relative to its historical IV provides cheap option prices, so debit spreads are better in low IV environments.
