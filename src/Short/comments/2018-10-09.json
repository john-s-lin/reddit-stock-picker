But to me stocks are like my sports team so I also do it to \"gamble\" (with respect to an index) and have a rooting interest.

Study canopy growth chart the past 4 years and see how long did it get to now. They are preparing the foundation. Have you build a house or build your own business? It is not easy, it takes time and sometimes permit can delay your project. The scope is HUGE that means high complexity which will require more time and cost. The fact they collaborate is a good thing because the bigger the scope = higher default risk. \n\nThey made good strategically moves acquiring Therapix for patents, mitigate construction expense to Auxly, mitigate retail expense with high tide (famous brandz), onsite tablet production with canntab. I also like that they are being stingy with their marketing expense. But they respond to investor's email, unlike aleafia. I am gonna sit on this stock for a year or more. Why? Because the long shelf life of tablet, it is perfect for export and storaging. You will not see mold. Being focus in medical have a high chance of dominating global market because some countries won't legalize high THC and will legalize the medical side of cannabis first.\n\nI am just wondering why they wouldn't use LED lights that have low wattage? Other light have shorter product lifespan compare to led but they produce more heat. \n\nHow much will their energy expense will be? You can calculate this by finding expected total wattage consumption x electricity rate. \n\nHydroponics is the best method to get high quality product but why not aeroponic that is preserving more water? If their running closed end cycle then their water bill will be less than soil. No soil = less pest = no root fungus = less crop failure rate = consistent quality. \n\nHow many harvest time in a year that they can do with their indoor facility? JWCA claim 5.2x with their rolling out system. It is about time management and layout design. \n\nI would like the data of their feasibility study. \n\nTo be investing in cannabis you need to have knowledge more than just technical analysis. You should know accounting, agrotech, construction, manufacturing, project management, biology/chemistry/pharmaceutical, risk management, SCM, etc. This is why cannabis industry is not like crypto currency. It is REAL. \n\nRetail will be red ocean, a bloodbath, so there is no need to get all excited to company like medmen. Brick to mortar is not sustainable because of the high cost of rent. Canada closed most of it's retail stores like Kmart, SEARS, Chapters, etc. It is because loosing to ecommerce that have more efficient supply chain management.\n\nAlso find company that diversify in Non-smokers market. It is bigger than smokers market. Sick patients will consume frequently and they might grow themselves but are they capable? Which company have the knowledge to achieve low cost production? Aphria direct cost is low but if you include indirect cost they are high because they are not mitigating cost through collaboration. They have 5 brands that re selling pretty so not entirely bad. \n\nPersonally, I like Supreme pharma more though $200m asset and the market cap only 2-2.5x of the asset. They have mature supply chain, not on steroid and focus at product quality. Other matured cannabis company will seems to be overvalued. \n\nI like categorizing cannabis companies into 4 cannabis stages: germination, seedling, vegetative, flowering. Seedling stage is the earliest stage you can identify a winner. Safe bet probably at flowering stage. Seedling is very fragile and sometimes it needs to be in a dome. It needs strong investors who have faith in the company and protect it from traders who are creating volatility/noise. People who are shorting also creating negative rumours to drive the SP down. \n\nBottomline, FSD is a gem that everyone is mocking. My speculation may change depending on any new data in the future. I think FSD is 70% a winner, remember investing in stock is a GAMBLE. It is like Khabib vs McGregor fight, the underdog win when everyone doubt him because he was against McGregor hype/fans. I don't like pennystock but I do like this one because of the business model.
