Knowing the trend first was more important than relying on BB. Trends will make reversals weaker and sometimes not worth it.

In an uptrend, price is more likely to move horizontally than have a reversal. Where reversal does happen, BB failed to predict it.\n\nMAs + RSI were more than sufficient to assure that a reversal (retracement, really) is imminent.

Various companies that deal in oil on different levels. Only PDS does not hold a good dividend \\(actually no dividend\\), the rest are great. VNOM runs 5.4 but is running way over on PT right now. I think VLO is still okay to buy however. That said, if I don't get more this am, I doubt I will. It's going green so it'll probably shoot up a bunch again.

I'm bullish on oil (obviously) but there is no oil price god, and while there's not a doubt in my mind oil prices will head up eventually, it could turn out to be later rather than sooner. You can take a chance on a high risk producer (such as CRC) that will pop magnificently if it happens sooner, or go bankrupt if it happens later. The stuff in my portfolio can all survive lower for longer for another 5 years, although I might not like what the share price does in the meantime if oil prices don't cooperate. But I don't think it's going to take that long, which is why I'm positioned the way I am.\n\nI gave some thought to ENB, but I decided I am looking for more of what I believe will be multi-baggers in the coming oil boom and I have my doubts ENB will fly away to the sky like that, although it should be a good steady growing thing, and the price is right today.\n\nMost of these I expect to hold for 5-10 years.
