I like TTWO more than ATVI but ATVI isn't going anywhere and has been obliterated. PANW well off the highs - FB has discussed buying a cybersecurity co and while there's certainly no guarantee whatsoever that it will be PANW if there is a purchase by FB of a major cybersecurity co it will touch off a \"who's next\". \n\nGoogle also well off the highs - while there are things that I continue to dislike about Google, it's appealing as it gets closer to a grand again, with Waymo as an opportunity that hopefully will go better than some of the other \"other bets\" at Google have in recent years.\n\nStill like Amazon. Adobe analytics calling Cyber Monday 2018 the biggest shopping day in US history and I think there's still a good deal of potential opportunity for Amazon in healthcare and logistics.\n\nNXPI was going to be bought by Qualcomm for $110 and considered raising the bid before the deal fell apart because of China;  since then it has slid into the $70's only to rebound recently a bit after a good quarter last quarter. https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/18/06/11859513/nxp-semiconductors-standalone-value-is-119-suntrust-say", "score": 34, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 319, "submission_ratio": 0.10658307210031348, "submission_title": "Microsoft shares are down 11% from the stock's 52-week high, and still look good compared to the rest", "submission_text": "MSFT Current Price: $103.07 \n\n[\"Investing in the software giant now allows one to take advantage of the current weakness.

MSFT has held up well and better than most of tech during the selloff. Buying some to start a position or lower your cost basis would be ok. I posted about NVDA about a week ago in r/investing and said:\n\n\"NVDA has gone down a lot but if you look at the price action in the previous couple of days, the stock has gone down from the 202 close last Thursday to 134 where it opened today and did so on volume about 4x higher than normal. That's often a sign of a washout.\n\nToday when NVDA opened, it initially went down a bit but then the buyers came in and reversed the decline to close at 145 on about 4x normal volume. Anytime you see a big decline on heavy volume followed by an intraday reversal on heavy volume that often marks a bottom in the stock.\" \n\nFor now it looks like I was right but regardless, it was a good spot to buy some as NVDA is the best at what they do. They are still well off their highs. ADBE is one of the best cloud stocks to own and still 16% off it's high despite the bounce. Not a bad place to buy some.  I prefer TTWO in the gaming space as it's the one that has the best management and is firing on all cylinders. It has been hurt the least of the three in the selloff and the one to own going forward. \n\nLike you said, Google is also well off the highs. Waymo is the leader in autonomous driving and recently got license plates in Cali to operate driverless vehicles on public roads without passengers albeit with remote drivers to take control, if necessary. AMZN is well off it's highs as well but is doing fine as a company. Both are ok for a small buy at this point.\n\nNXPI has yet to recover to what it was before the deal with Qualcomm. I would need to see it back to that level before considering pulling the trigger on it.\n\nIf there is one point I wish to make is that while there are some good buys to be had, they should be small buys as there's no reason to believe this selloff is over until we have a better idea of what the Fed will do with rates and what the tariff picture is like in 2019.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 319, "submission_ratio": 0.003134796238244514, "submission_title": "Microsoft shares are down 11% from the stock's 52-week high, and still look good compared to the rest", "submission_text": "MSFT Current Price: $103.07 \n\n[\"Investing in the software giant now allows one to take advantage of the current weakness.

I don't think that's considered a \"splitting stock\".\n\nSpin-off would probably be the more correct search keyword.\n\nIf you really want to understand the implications, you should probably study UTX's SEC filings (10-Ks) and figure out how much each part of the enterprise was contributing to revenue.... and then consider how they propose splitting the company up (stock allocation proportions).  I'd also look at insider allocations.  Why go through all this trouble?  Well, we've got another stock much, much bigger than UTX that will be spinning-off various parts of the business in order to try to improve their situation (and that stock is GE).  UTX seems like it might be headed down a similar path, with debt to equity in the high 90% and mid 80% range for long term debt to equity.  This is probably one of those stocks that will not do well as interest rates continue to rise.  So, by spinning-off parts of the operations, some people who aren't paying attention will be screwed and others who exit the stock now and re-enter the more profitable spun-off entities will come out ahead.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "Should i buy a splitting stock?", "submission_text": "Utx is planning on splitting into 3 companies.

Google being the #1 best place to work for 6 straight years.\n\n\"For the sixth year running, Google has landed the top spot on our list of the country\u2019s Best Companies to Work For. \"\n\nhttp://fortune.com/best-companies/2017/google/\n\nSo Google gets all the top draft choices.  Then Google got to take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send to Waymo.\n\nWhy they are years ahead of everyone else and only one with a service charging today.\n\nWill be winner take all and Waymo has such a huge lead it is over.
