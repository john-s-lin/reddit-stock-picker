First off buying at 240 was a mistake which you could have evaded with a simple P/E ratio analysis. That said however, lets chart up some scenarios, but first some numbers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEPS 9 months: 5.71$\n\nEPS 12 months (estimated lower bound): 7$\n\nReasonable P/E: 20\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. \\*\\*Stock stays at 200\\*\\*: 200 / 20 = 10 EPS but we have 7 estimated, we're 30% overpriced\n2. \\*\\*Stock falls to 150\\*\\*: 150 / 20 = 7.5 EPS but we have 7 estimated, we're off by 0.5$ but it's within the acceptable margin of error imo\n3. \\*\\*Assuming 25 P/E\\*\\*: 7 \\* 25 = 175$\n4. \\*\\*Assuming 7.25 EPS and 30 P/E\\*\\*: 7.25 \\* 30 = 217.5$ which is more than current price\n\nSo what does this tell us?\n\nWell, at 150, the stock is a steal considering future potential earnings. Besides, chart wise, we need to be very oversold to get there in a short period of time. is Nvidia a 25% worse off company today than it was yesterday because there is a channel of stock that needs to clear? maybe yea if you look quarter to quarter, but's it's a temporary problem.\n\nAt 200, the price is definitely too high as the P/E needs to come down in light of new info and across all US market sectors regardless.\n\nAt 175$ we see a reasonably corrected price where the P/E is a bit more reasonable and in line with some conservative EPS expectations. Additionally, that would form a double bottom on the chart from which consolidation and future push to the upside might come. So I think we're going to end up here by EOD. Seems reasonable\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said, the problem Nvidia has is not an Nvidia problem. It's an economy problem. This channel stuff will get resolved before you know it and life will go on. However, the overall bearish S&P trend is what we all need to be worried about. Because 200 or 175 or 150 won't matter if the S&P itself is going to shit.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 29, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 6, "submission_ratio": 4.833333333333333, "submission_title": "NVDA, any advice?", "submission_text": "What to do with Nvidia?

It sounds like you thought you were investing but were momentum trading instead. When you're momentum trading, you get out once the momentum has slowed or reversed. This can be done using a simple crossover system. I would suggest a 10/20 crossover or 15/30 crossover. Before entering a position, you need to have at least 3 things worked out before you click buy.

That said however, lets chart up some scenarios, but first some numbers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEPS 9 months: 5.71$\n\nEPS 12 months (estimated lower bound): 7$\n\nReasonable P/E: 20\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. \\*\\*Stock stays at 200\\*\\*: 200 / 20 = 10 EPS but we have 7 estimated, we're 30% overpriced\n2. \\*\\*Stock falls to 150\\*\\*: 150 / 20 = 7.5 EPS but we have 7 estimated, we're off by 0.5$ but it's within the acceptable margin of error imo\n3. \\*\\*Assuming 25 P/E\\*\\*: 7 \\* 25 = 175$\n4. \\*\\*Assuming 7.25 EPS and 30 P/E\\*\\*: 7.25 \\* 30 = 217.5$ which is more than current price\n\nSo what does this tell us?\n\nWell, at 150, the stock is a steal considering future potential earnings. Besides, chart wise, we need to be very oversold to get there in a short period of time. is Nvidia a 25% worse off company today than it was yesterday because there is a channel of stock that needs to clear? maybe yea if you look quarter to quarter, but's it's a temporary problem.\n\nAt 200, the price is definitely too high as the P/E needs to come down in light of new info and across all US market sectors regardless.\n\nAt 175$ we see a reasonably corrected price where the P/E is a bit more reasonable and in line with some conservative EPS expectations. Additionally, that would form a double bottom on the chart from which consolidation and future push to the upside might come. So I think we're going to end up here by EOD. Seems reasonable\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said, the problem Nvidia has is not an Nvidia problem. It's an economy problem. This channel stuff will get resolved before you know it and life will go on. However, the overall bearish S&P trend is what we all need to be worried about. Because 200 or 175 or 150 won't matter if the S&P itself is going to shit.\n\n&#x200B;", "parent_score": 29, "parent_ratio": 0.06896551724137931}, {"time": 1542381815.0, "submission_id": "9xk9i0", "comment_id": "e9thli6", "body": "I did that when EA dropped, guess what happened next(it dropped more).

When you're momentum trading, you get out once the momentum has slowed or reversed. This can be done using a simple crossover system. I would suggest a 10/20 crossover or 15/30 crossover.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.

In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.

The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.

See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.

If OP has $1,500 in margin INTEREST, OP borrowed $15,000 from the broker.\n\nHOWEVER, margin interest is calculated, for this example, as follows: $15,000 x .10 = $1,500 / 360 = $4.17 per day. Margin interest is charged daily over a 360-day year. If OP accumulated $1,500 in margin interest, they would have held this trade for that full length. This means that OP is also now not liable for a short-term tax rate.\n\nMargin is usually around 2x leverage, so, it would be safe to assume that their total cost was $30,000.\n\n$2,000 in capital gains would have been a return of +~6.67%. $32,000 (total) - $15,000 (principal) - $15,000 (borrowed) - $1,500 (interest) = $500 (profit). Subtract whatever taxes would be applicable to the $2,000 capital gains, which is equal to their income tax bracket once the capital gains are long-term, and, yes, this trade would have most likely resulted in a loss, because the ~6.67% investment return was LESS THAN the 360-day margin interest rate of 10%.\n\nIf the OP meant to say \u201cmargin loan\u201d as opposed to \u201cmargin interest\u201d, than the total cost of the trade would have been $3,000. $1,500 loaned, and, $1,500 principal. A $2,000 gain would have been a +~66.67% return. This is huge! $5,000 (total) - $1,500 (principal) - $1,500 (borrowed) = $2,000 (profit). Let\u2019s pretend that this trade 10 days long, making it short-term.\n\n$1,500 x .10 = $150 / 360 = $0.42. It would cost $0.42 every day to borrow $1,500. Therefore, $0.42 x 10 days = $4.20 in MARGIN INTEREST. The $2,000 profit - $4.20 is $1,995.80.\n\nNow, we can apply OP\u2019s provided tax rate of 35%. $2,000 x .35 = $700. $1,995.80 - $700 = $1,295.80!\n\nAfter this hypothetical 10-day trade that yielded an enormous return, with all factors included, this trade would have put nearly $1,300 in their pocket.\n\nMargin is an excellent and simple tool.
