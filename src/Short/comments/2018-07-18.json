Competitors will not only have to make cost effective aircraft on pricing and efficiency alone but the commonality Boeing and Airbus have implemented as well. Then there's the discounts loyal customers get which no one really knows how much they pay for so that's another barrier for new entries. \n\nFurthermore with the recent deals with Bombardier and Embraer, Airbus and Boeing are now cornering the whole commercial market range from small regional jets to narrow body and wide body mainliners. If China and Russia are going to break Airbus and Boeing their sales prospects will be limited to their countries because their governments own both the companies that manufacture the planes and the airlines that buy them. \n\nEdit:\n\nThe Chinese have a plane called the COMAC C919.\nIts main advantage is its price tag of $50 million which is 30% cheaper than its two competitors the 737 and A320. \n\nHowever that's because it's not made of the same materials as western aircraft, in fact it uses a lot more aluminum and not enough composites which will make the aircraft more costly to operate due to the impact aluminum's heavy weight will have on the plane's range and payload capabilities. \n\nComposites are incredibly expensive and for now only Boeing and Airbus can afford it, allowing them to make multi-market aircraft due to the lightness of the material. Smaller planes can now fly further and larger planes can carry less passengers and still make a profit, which means they can fly to new markets from the usual expensive hubs. Like New York to Xiamen China. You can't do that on aluminum built aircraft because the fuel burn will be so high it will demand the aircraft to be at least 70% full to make a profit, composites can bring that threshold down to a lower number and that allows big planes to be versatile and naturally cost effective. \n\nYou don't need to be a small plane to fly short routes and you don't need a big plane to fly long routes anymore, you can have mid sized jet that can fly to both markets! Composites are the key ingredient and it's only until the Russians and Chinese master it will they be able to be considered a major threat.

The key word is \"e-commerce.\" UPS and FedEx make 90% of their bread and butter from business to business service. This article (written by a nobody) correctly points out the inefficiencies in residential deliveries. \n\nInefficiencies:\n - residential stops are off the beaten path and possibly for a small box that is making the company pennies if not losing money.\n\n- residential stops are also a pain to deal with because they aren't bulk stops or they can cut I to volume space on trucks because it's a 50lb box of dog food or a large box of paper towels etc. \n\n- You miss out in the drop off pick up dynamic that keeps the profits churning like a business service.\n\nMost people don't realize this but Amazon subsidizes all of their Prime deliveries. You really think that 2 day shipping is free for an unlimited amount if items all for $114 bucks a year?! Well it's not. They pay UPS and FedEx for this service. Amazon couldn't even offer this service to 95% of the country if UPS and FedEx didn't exist. \n\nSomeone below said they work is supply chain and that Amazon is light-years ahead of the competition. (Clearly a fan boy statement). What exactly have they don't in logistics? Contracted out to private I dividuals in minivans (which is basically only in cities). \n\nUPS has advanced facilities (world port) Logistics is all about infastructure (which amazing doesn't have and won't have for a long time.) \n\nUPS is also working in drone deliveries and drone warehousing, AI, and block chain. They hire MIT and Stanford grads just like Amazon. \n\nUPS has a new medical facility in NJ that focuses on cold shipments, pharmaceuticals, and surgical instruments which are cleaned packaged processed etc all in house. \n\nWalmart will beat them in grocery delivery. They already have the infastructure which allows then to deliver fresher food quicker. \n\nLastly. The main point is Amazon is only focused on residential deliveries. Which is the toughest sector to profit in. And until they can find a way to make a profit on their services without having to subsidize then they aren't really a threat. \n\nAnd with the recent strike that Amazon had across Europe due to their terrible treat ment of employees, low pay grade, and horrible working conditions they are fighting the looking threat of employee unionization.

The key word is \"e-commerce.\" UPS and FedEx make 90% of their bread and butter from business to business service. This article (written by a nobody) correctly points out the inefficiencies in residential deliveries. \n\nInefficiencies:\n - residential stops are off the beaten path and possibly for a small box that is making the company pennies if not losing money.\n\n- residential stops are also a pain to deal with because they aren't bulk stops or they can cut I to volume space on trucks because it's a 50lb box of dog food or a large box of paper towels etc. \n\n- You miss out in the drop off pick up dynamic that keeps the profits churning like a business service.\n\nMost people don't realize this but Amazon subsidizes all of their Prime deliveries. You really think that 2 day shipping is free for an unlimited amount if items all for $114 bucks a year?! Well it's not. They pay UPS and FedEx for this service. Amazon couldn't even offer this service to 95% of the country if UPS and FedEx didn't exist. \n\nSomeone below said they work is supply chain and that Amazon is light-years ahead of the competition. (Clearly a fan boy statement). What exactly have they don't in logistics? Contracted out to private I dividuals in minivans (which is basically only in cities). \n\nUPS has advanced facilities (world port) Logistics is all about infastructure (which amazing doesn't have and won't have for a long time.) \n\nUPS is also working in drone deliveries and drone warehousing, AI, and block chain. They hire MIT and Stanford grads just like Amazon. \n\nUPS has a new medical facility in NJ that focuses on cold shipments, pharmaceuticals, and surgical instruments which are cleaned packaged processed etc all in house. \n\nWalmart will beat them in grocery delivery. They already have the infastructure which allows then to deliver fresher food quicker. \n\nLastly. The main point is Amazon is only focused on residential deliveries. Which is the toughest sector to profit in. And until they can find a way to make a profit on their services without having to subsidize then they aren't really a threat. \n\nAnd with the recent strike that Amazon had across Europe due to their terrible treat ment of employees, low pay grade, and horrible working conditions they are fighting the looking threat of employee unionization.

Yes you can lose more money than what you deposit (technically) and yes the maximum amount that you lose is what you deposit. You may wonder and how tf does this work?.\n\nEasy, when you lose more than your guarantee (the deposit) plus500 will just close your position and take all your money. They won't allow you to stay in the position if you lose more than the guarantee. If the minute after they close it bounces then bad luck you did a good trade but you end up losing everything.\n\nHowever if for whaever reason they fuck up and dont close your position you could end up owing them all that money and they will want to recover it somehow.\n\nMy advice, enter the position put the stop loss above the 300 $ and in this way for sure you cannot lose more money than that. Be careful with leaving the position overnight and also maybe consider that if you have only $300 bucks maybe CFDs are yet not the best option.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Need help/confirmation about CFD's, specifically plus500", "submission_text": "Recently started a small contract on plus500 a CFD site.
