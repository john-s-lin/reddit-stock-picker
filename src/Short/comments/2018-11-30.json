Cloonan, founder & chairman of [AAII.com](https://AAII.com) covers this topic in detail, as well as etf portfolio construction. RSP doesn't have the history & data behind it, but it's what I own outside of my 401k. Inside my 401k, I own an aggressive portfolio of DFA (dimensional funds) that I DCA into on a monthly basis. I set that and forget that for the next 30 years, max funding. \n\nI don't believe in tinkering or 'micro-managing' investments, though I know many who do. I've plowed through 1000's of books on these topics, am a professional myself (CFP, tax advice, CLU, trader, investor) and my belief from even reading books like \"The Millionaire Next Door\" and the \"Next Millionaire Next Door\" is that you 1st need a decent income, manage expenses, then, save your butt off. \n\nReal estate can work, too, but as a 'business', not a one-off property in your local home-town. Listen to biggerpockets, read their website and go from there. The real long-term accumulation in 'funds' comes from the reinvested dividends, cap gains (s/t) over decades that amounts to 40-60% of your REAL total accumulation, NOT just market appreciation. Ultimately, if you can live off 'dividends & interest', who cares what your balance is or what your portfolio does? That's the real goal here, not what 'capital sum' do you have. \n\nThe other alternative is then to save a capital sum that can be invested into an \"immediate annuity/pension\" for your life (and a spouse if you have one). That's the point of a 401k or any 'retirement plan.' The 3-4% w/d rules aren't hard and fast rules and need CONSTANT monitoring on an annual basis to work, and also need elements of behavioral management. Those rules are very dependent on rates of return, portfolio construction, taxes & fees, and subject to behavioral bias that may want to get 'more conservative as we age,' though it works against such rules, hence possibly needing some kind of annuity to back fill at that age (at least a portion of the money). \n\nThe boon to the S&P or RSP is that they are rules based, allocated to the markets and generally low cost. This removes human error and if done through ETFs much more tax and trading efficient. The RSP etf has more exposure to mid and lower cap stocks, so it has built-in tracking error. While it is the SP500, it still balances or tilts to small/mid cap more so than large cap. It also may trade more, so the underlying fees and trading fees (generally not measurable, just estimates) will be higher. I do think RSP is good as a core fund, as most won't properly allocate to small/mid cap stocks. \n\nAnother great resource is Paul Merriman ([www.paulmerriman.com](https://www.paulmerriman.com)). At 38 I combine what Eugene Fama, Kenneth French, DFA, James Cloonan, Paul Merriman, Meb Faber and John Bogle advise. I tilt value over growth, core, then explore, focus on 'building wealth slowly,' keeping fees low, and keep taxes managed adequately (some taxes are ok on investments if managed, you can't get rid of them or you're making no $ or doing poor planning).

I feel in the long run, 5-10 years, Android's ecosystem will become more profitable. My belief is that there is some upper bound price for smartphones which will effect the market share of Apple's iPhone. If Apple continues to increase iPhone prices, their iPhone sales will start to cannibalize their service revenue as their market share peaks. \n\nMy main fear with Apple is a major source of revenue comes from sales of Macs, iPhones, iPads. I believe the main generator of profitability is from the ecosystem effect from their operating systems and software development. While the hardware definitely affects the final product, the role hardware plays is decreasing as hardware capabilities increase compared to average user needs. \n\nRefresh cycles for phones are slowing just like PC refresh cycles slowed a few years ago. I believe it will continue to slow as the gap between cutting edge smartphones and mid-tier smartphone decreases while prices of smartphones keep increasing. \n\nI could be wrong.
