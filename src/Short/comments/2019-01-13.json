If I can buy a contract at 1 penny a stock at a strike price of 110 while the stock is at 100 and it goes to 111 I make 99\u00a2 for every penny I spent. Whereas if I buy at 101 for a dollar and it goes up to 111 I only made 10\u00a2 for every penny spent. In my example the lower strike price would net you 900% profit while a higher strike price comes out at 9900%.

Just be informed about bid / ask price related to selling on the app. From support:. \n\n \"The price displayed on Robinhood is the price of the last trade as reported by NASDAQ, and not necessarily the price at which your order will execute, even if placed immediately.\n\nThe prices at which shares are available for selling and buying are called the bid price and the ask price, respectively.\nThe bid is the highest price investors are currently willing to purchase a stock, and the ask is the lowest price investors are currently willing to sell the stock for. The difference between these two prices is called the bid-ask spread.\n\nA market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the best available price. Therefore, if you place a market order to sell, the market will work to fill you at the best bid price, and if you place a market buy order, the market will work to fill you at the best ask price. The size of the inside bid-ask spread can vary greatly depending on the underlying stock and current market conditions, so if you place a market order your execution can be at a different price than the last trade price.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for your order to fill at a higher or lower price than the recorded high/low for the day. This may happen if the order is not executed in a 100 share (even lot) increment. The recorded high/low is based on even lot executions only.\n\nPlease note, you may possibly avoid executions far from the last trade price by placing limit orders.\"\n\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Which service I should use to invest in stocks?", "submission_text": "Could someone recommend me a reliable service to trade and buy stocks?

Here is the post. Anyway I decided to do some quick reading through some of their documents, and I think I found a place where possible fraud could be occurring.\n\nSo Caravan was subsidiary of Drivetime and spun off into a independent company a few years ago. Well if your read Caravan's registration statement it is clear the two companies are far from independent. Drivetime is owned by Ernest Garcia II(convicted Fraudster), the father of Caravans CEO. He also holds a large portion in CVNA. Here is a list of some of the non-arms length transaction between the two:\n\nCVNA leases properties, offices, and storage spaces from DT. DT has obtained a limited license to CVNA intellectual property Until sep 2016 CVNA bought ALL of their cars from DT DT buys the majority of CVNA receivables The last bullet is the most important in my theory. So when Carvana provides financing to buyers they never hold on to the receivable. They turn around a factor it to Drivetime. This is where I think potential fraud could be occurring. When factoring receivables to a related company it would be easy to collude to either factor fake invoices or sell invoices they know are non collectable. The sale of receivables are non recourse meaning CVNA is not liable for any bad debts. DT gets the collectable and either collects or gets a tax write off for bad debts. Here is where it gets interesting. DT has already been fined 8 million dollars in the past for illegal collection policies. If CVNA is not faking invoices then they are at least selling a car to anyone regardless of their credit then offloading the collections to DT, who harasses customers into paying. This makes it look like CVNA is a rapidly growing business when in fact its a sham.\n\nThere is something wrong with Caravan and is likely a good potential short. I would wait to see what this quarters earnings are like.\n\nEdit: Just found this: With a minimum FICO requirement of 300, Carvana essentially has no minimum threshold when it comes to your credit score. To be approved for financing, however, you must be at least 18 years old, make at least $10,000 annually and not have any current bankruptcies. The maximum loan term is 72 months. So basically the company is offloading deep subprime auto loans to DT to make it look like they are selling cars.\n\nEdit 2: More sketchy stuff: \"On March 31, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Ernest Garcia, II, for $10.0 million. The loan bore interest at an annual rate of 4.0% and had a maturity date of May 1, 2016. On April 28, 2016, we repaid the principal and $30.0 thousand of accrued interest, thereby terminating the loan.\"\n\nBorrowed 10 million from his father for 28 days. Quick way for his dad to make 30 grand.\n\nHoly Shit: The CEO of Drivetime Raymond fidel was also convicted of fraud in the same case as Ernest Garcia II\n\nEdit 3: Without Drivetime I'm positive CVNA would fail. Well in the registration statement it mentions that Drivetime may be for sale. If Drivetime is sold, CVNA is done for.\n\nEdit 4: More ethical behavior from DT back in 2009. \"CarMax Auto Superstores Inc. is suing Phoenix-based rival Drive\u00adTime Car Sales Inc., alleging the company bribed or tried to bribe CarMax salespeople to divert business to Drive\u00adTime.\"\n\nEdit 5: If I can I will ask on the conference call about possible sale of Drivetime as well as something about factoring receivables.\n\nEdit 6: Article from SA that adds to what I posted. I did not write this, but think it helps understand additional problems with Carvana. \n\nReason for not immediately shorting / buying put options:\n\nresearch - company is worth 2 billion; options chain is weak  \nearnings are due in 8-8-2017 after market close  \nlack of a lawsuit  \nlockup ends on 10/25/2017  \npossible collusion with Wells Fargo for loan origination into the subprime auto debt market  \n", "score": 8, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 2.6666666666666665, "submission_title": "Big Carvana Holder Buys Up More Stock", "submission_text": "[removed]", "parent_text": "Big Carvana Holder Buys Up More Stock [removed]", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 2.6666666666666665}, {"time": 1547428972.0, "submission_id": "afpv2n", "comment_id": "ee0ozg2", "body": "Definitely a buy.

These are usually stable businesses and you can be pretty confident that they will keep paying their dividends and often increasing them. Reinvesting the dividend is like compounding interest on your stock. So even if the stock doesn't increase as much as a shiny tech company, the resulting growth might be bigger. But you need to keep taxes on dividends in mind when going for dividend stocks.\n\n**P/E ratio** is the ratio of the *price* of the stock and *earnings per share*.

It is an income you receive for holding a stock, usually paid quarterly, and usually yealding annually low-single-digit % of the stock price. If you keep reinvesting the dividend, you can buy more shares of the stock, which results in a nice compund growth, even if these stocks typically increase in value a little slower than other stocks.\n\nSome companies have a great history of increasing the dividends - look up dividend aristocrats (companies that haven't lowered their dividend in at least 25 years) and dividend kings (50 y)). These are usually stable businesses and you can be pretty confident that they will keep paying their dividends and often increasing them. Reinvesting the dividend is like compounding interest on your stock. So even if the stock doesn't increase as much as a shiny tech company, the resulting growth might be bigger. But you need to keep taxes on dividends in mind when going for dividend stocks.\n\n**P/E ratio** is the ratio of the *price* of the stock and *earnings per share*. It means basically how much you pay for a single dollar of annual earnings (profit). Growth stocks typically have a high P/E ratio, because shareholders expect the earnings to increase a lot.

So, pick your poison? \n\nLogistics- Both are the literal cutting edge of the logistics game. Google is developing their side on the consumer user (Alexa being more responsive, Google learning your searches), while Amazon is using theirs to increase their hold on the cloud (AWS), warehouses, grocery space, and now into some shipping routes. Amazon has implementated their delivery capabilities to down stream and independent contractors to thicken the shipping web. This was a great way to horizontal and vertically solidify their weight in this sector. Once again, tie? \n\nIntergration- Both companies have bought up and down stream to ensure their businesses are getting the best deals to either develop or bring the product to the consumer. I mentioned Amazon hiring independent contractors to start building webs of delivery logistics, but then again, Google has positioned themselves as an ad revenue based company too. Amazon I feel has the better edge of their vertical and horizontal intergration.\n\nIn my eyes, I will say I would wait to see what the Bezos divorce has in store.

It would be a toss up with two clear winners in different yin and yangs of different spaces. \n\nAI- I would say Google. They are both developing really well into this space. Google is developing their AI into phones and consumer consumables than Amazon's AI into learning and processing for businesses. So, pick your poison? \n\nLogistics- Both are the literal cutting edge of the logistics game. Google is developing their side on the consumer user (Alexa being more responsive, Google learning your searches), while Amazon is using theirs to increase their hold on the cloud (AWS), warehouses, grocery space, and now into some shipping routes. Amazon has implementated their delivery capabilities to down stream and independent contractors to thicken the shipping web. This was a great way to horizontal and vertically solidify their weight in this sector. Once again, tie? \n\nIntergration- Both companies have bought up and down stream to ensure their businesses are getting the best deals to either develop or bring the product to the consumer. I mentioned Amazon hiring independent contractors to start building webs of delivery logistics, but then again, Google has positioned themselves as an ad revenue based company too. Amazon I feel has the better edge of their vertical and horizontal intergration.\n\nIn my eyes, I will say I would wait to see what the Bezos divorce has in store. It shouldn't hurt a great company like Amazon, but weirder stuff has taken down a giant. I like Google a lot, but I believe they have a potential of being separated soon to avoid being in violation of antitrust laws and acts. These are my two cents, so do you own due diligence.
