When you see major movements around earnings reports that is the market pricing in earnings and future guidance in real time. So if you were to find a news article about fb a week or two after earnings and noticed that their guidance says that that they are expecting lower revenues next year, thus breaking their current growth trend, that news might worry you but at the same time it will already be priced into the stock at that point and earnings expectations have already been re-evaluated. In this example everyone is expecting a foreseeable future event to unfold a certain way. \n\nWhen it comes to future events that are impossible to foresee or be certain of the outcome then it's the probabilities and confusion that get priced in. The actual outcome can't be fully priced in because there is no market wide certainty that it will happen. So if it's expected that a trade deal will fall through then people will stop buying and possibly start selling some of the assets that will be affected by the continuation of tariffs. That's the individual market participants pricing in the outcome that they believe. When the actual outcome happens the market will recalibrate again. \n\nSo I guess to really answer your point, everything that is known is believed to be priced into the stock. To say that it is not would basically mean that market participants are hearing news and simply ignoring the possible impact it will have on their stocks. This wouldn't make sense. If you want to know if something hasn't been priced in then just ask yourself if everybody knows it. If they do then it's already priced in. If only you or a subset of market participants are aware of this information then it has not been fully priced in.

So it might be worth buying BABA calls because you know everyone loves that stock but the trade war has been holding it back. Or maybe you just want to go with SPY calls because you know the whole market is moving up in positive news. There's no right or wrong answer either way just don't gamble/guess with options unless you're hedging a bigger play. \n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 17, "submission_ratio": 0.17647058823529413, "submission_title": "ETF vs Single Stock", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "ETF vs Single Stock [deleted]", "parent_score": 17, "parent_ratio": 0.17647058823529413}, {"time": 1546821634.0, "submission_id": "adbc6k", "comment_id": "edfktpm", "body": "is this a serious question? what is happening to this sub", "score": 5, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 17, "submission_ratio": 0.29411764705882354, "submission_title": "ETF vs Single Stock", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "ETF vs Single Stock [deleted]", "parent_score": 17, "parent_ratio": 0.29411764705882354}, {"time": 1546823385.0, "submission_id": "adbc6k", "comment_id": "edfnu95", "body": "In terms of options, ETFs have far more liquidity ", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 17, "submission_ratio": 0.11764705882352941, "submission_title": "ETF vs Single Stock", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "ETF vs Single Stock [deleted]", "parent_score": 17, "parent_ratio": 0.11764705882352941}, {"time": 1546834161.0, "submission_id": "adbc6k", "comment_id": "edg2pfc", "body": "If you don't know, then do 3 minutes of fucking research then come back and delete this shitpost.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 17, "submission_ratio": 0.11764705882352941, "submission_title": "ETF vs Single Stock", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "ETF vs Single Stock [deleted]", "parent_score": 17, "parent_ratio": 0.11764705882352941}, {"time": 1546817918.0, "submission_id": "adbc6k", "comment_id": "edffci9", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 17, "submission_ratio": 0.11764705882352941, "submission_title": "ETF vs Single Stock", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "ETF vs Single Stock [deleted]", "parent_score": 17, "parent_ratio": 0.11764705882352941}, {"time": 1546824903.0, "submission_id": "adbc6k", "comment_id": "edfq8g2", "body": "You will never lose all of your money in a broad market ETF.

You must pay back this debt + interest no matter what happens with he price of your purchased asset (otherwise you default...and that\u2019s really bad).  The use of margin amplifies returns to equity and, by extension, the variance of your position...higher variance = higher risk. \n\nSo, if you have $100 of equity and can borrow $100...you can fund a $200 position. If the asset appreciates by 10%, you have a 20% ROE. The opposite is true if the asset depreciates. The reason why positions get forcibly closed is that you are supposed to maintain a minimum amount of equity. If you are required to maintain $50 in equity and the asset falls by 25% ($50) you will face a margin call - you can either liquidate the position to pay your debt or pay in new capital to increase your equity. This forced selling can be disadvantageous because it is generally done at the lows...\n\nAnyways. Check out investopedia and other resources to bone up on this. Don\u2019t trade on margin if you don\u2019t understand it! It\u2019s not that complex but the amplification of losses can really mess your day up.

To you, the person that is long an equity, you are correct the total return of owning the equity does not change \\*much\\* i.e. there is nothing \"magical about dividends\" as I stated above.-- (the \"friction\" of taxes makes it less than even when a dividend is paid out, so that dollar in dividends paid to you is really 80-85 cents on the dollar).  But that aspect not withstanding, you own said shares (minus the dividend) plus the cash dividend distributed so that is close to a wash from your perspective as a current owner.  \n\nHowever, say you own a stock trading at $50 and they declare a $1 dividend.  On the day the equity trades \"ex-dividend\", i.e. the new buyers of said security are not entitled to that $1 declared dividend, all else being equal, the stock will begin trading at roughly $49.  And this makes sense when thought through logically.  All else held equal, a company will necessarily trade at a discount to what is being paid out in cash.  I mean why would a NEW BUYER bid the exact same price for the equity when x dollars have just been taken from the company and given to someone that is not said bidder??  They wouldn't.  A lot of times its not that noticeable, as quarterly dividends aren't really that big. --I mean on any given day would you think much about one of your holdings opening down .50 cents or something??  And it's not to say by close of business the underlying equity won't have overcome that .50 cent \"hurdle\" and turn green for the day due to some other event.  But as an example you can see it quite evidently when companies pay out special one time large dividends.  I included an article from WSJ on MSFTs 2004 special dividend to see a more pronounced impact of what happens to a stock when a large amount of cash is distributed out.  It is likely behind WSJ's paywall so hopefully you are able to see.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you can make the example as easy as say you were going to buy a McDonalds stand.  And all else held equal the partners (shareholders) of that McDonalds stand decide they want to take a cash distribution for whatever reason before close.  Your bid, for that McDonalds stand, all else equal, will be lowered by the amount of cash distribution.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd salut to you for earning your living off the dividends, Cornelius Vanderbilt style.  American Dream stuff right there... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/04/the-ex-dividend-date-and-what-it-means-for-your-st.aspx](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/04/the-ex-dividend-date-and-what-it-means-for-your-st.aspx)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109035431245368850](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109035431245368850)", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 66, "submission_ratio": 0.030303030303030304, "submission_title": "Buying on margin", "submission_text": "I\u2019ve never used margin but always heard it\u2019s discouraged.
