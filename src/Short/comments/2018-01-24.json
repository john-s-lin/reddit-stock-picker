I'm not an expert, actually started seriously reading about those companies yesterday because I wanted to diversify my portfolio and I've liked the airlines sector for a while now. I didn't do any numbers analysis or all, but I'm seeing this as a logical thought process once you take the time to think about it.\n\nBasically, United announced that they will be increasing their offer mostly for domestic flights. What I find interesting in SKYW (SkyWest) is that they fly for Delta, United, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, but not under the name SkyWest (which is why you may have not heard about them). In fact, they are the largest regional airline in North America. Their flights mostly consist of flying from small/mid airports to the large hubs of each of the big companies. To me, this is interesting because it positions them well with regards to 2 elements I've been reading a lot on today, following United's ER. \n\n1. United wants to increase its domestic offer and knows this is a key battleground : SkyWest operates their regional legs and thus, would benefit.\n\n2. Experts are afraid that increased capacity will lower fares and lead to a price wars. While that is indeed possible, I feel like SkyWest would be, to a certain extent, immune to a price wars since it actually contracts with four of the five major players for domestic travel in the US (exception being Southwest). \n\t\nNow, this is by no means DD or an expert's point of view, but this was enough to convince me to pick SKYW over any other Airline when I bought shares today.\n\nApparently, I am not the only one to have this opinion on the matter : https://imgur.com/a/dzQ8D\n\nThoughts?\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 15, "submission_ratio": 0.06666666666666667, "submission_title": "Dropping US Airlines stocks", "submission_text": "Seeing that most several American airlines' stocks went down quite a bit today, mainly because United Airlines will offer more and cheaper flights, would it be a good time to buy US airline stocks now?

I'm not an expert, actually started seriously reading about those companies yesterday because I wanted to diversify my portfolio and I've liked the airlines sector for a while now. I didn't do any numbers analysis or all, but I'm seeing this as a logical thought process once you take the time to think about it.\n\nBasically, United announced that they will be increasing their offer mostly for domestic flights. What I find interesting in SKYW (SkyWest) is that they fly for Delta, United, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, but not under the name SkyWest (which is why you may have not heard about them). In fact, they are the largest regional airline in North America. Their flights mostly consist of flying from small/mid airports to the large hubs of each of the big companies. To me, this is interesting because it positions them well with regards to 2 elements I've been reading a lot on today, following United's ER. \n\n1. United wants to increase its domestic offer and knows this is a key battleground : SkyWest operates their regional legs and thus, would benefit.\n\n2. Experts are afraid that increased capacity will lower fares and lead to a price wars. While that is indeed possible, I feel like SkyWest would be, to a certain extent, immune to a price wars since it actually contracts with four of the five major players for domestic travel in the US (exception being Southwest). \n\t\nNow, this is by no means DD or an expert's point of view, but this was enough to convince me to pick SKYW over any other Airline when I bought shares today.\n\nApparently, I am not the only one to have this opinion on the matter : https://imgur.com/a/dzQ8D\n\nThoughts?\n", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1516821880.0, "submission_id": "7sots1", "comment_id": "dt6igbv", "body": "So do I buy", "score": 4, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 15, "submission_ratio": 0.26666666666666666, "submission_title": "Dropping US Airlines stocks", "submission_text": "Seeing that most several American airlines' stocks went down quite a bit today, mainly because United Airlines will offer more and cheaper flights, would it be a good time to buy US airline stocks now?
