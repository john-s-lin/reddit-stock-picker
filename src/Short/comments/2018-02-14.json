After trying all the weak bullshit (Tylenol Migraine or whatever), my neurologist and I started sifting through options where the #1 side effect isn't death. Imitrex, Treximet, and a whole lot of things I can't pronounce that couldn't touch my migraines, finally we land on Vicodin/Hydrocodone and an anti-nausea pill. Oh, and weed btw. It could occasionally help push back migraines by a day or two, but it has become a difficult habit to break even when no longer needed. Once a week like clockwork, I'd need my meds and to lay down at home, work, wherever. My work was understanding only because I don't miss deadlines. Often worked with sunglasses on and only kept going with the support of my wife, my grandfather (aka hero/BFF) and my dog (who laid on the floor for hours beside me on her back during episodes). Forgive me if this is long-winded. I'm slightly high on life. Anyway, my grandfather and dog died one right after the migraines became more frequent. Weekly. Biweekly. Every other day. Every day. Then I feel into a seven day long migraine cycle. I couldn't do anything, not even think through the pain. Literally all I did for seven days straight was recite the Lord's Prayer because it was the only thing I could think of. Infusion centers, ER visits, etc. I guarantee I've spent over $10k on deep tissue massage just to try to relieve tension associated with my migraines.

Imitrex, Treximet, and a whole lot of things I can't pronounce that couldn't touch my migraines, finally we land on Vicodin/Hydrocodone and an anti-nausea pill. Oh, and weed btw. It could occasionally help push back migraines by a day or two, but it has become a difficult habit to break even when no longer needed. Once a week like clockwork, I'd need my meds and to lay down at home, work, wherever. My work was understanding only because I don't miss deadlines. Often worked with sunglasses on and only kept going with the support of my wife, my grandfather (aka hero/BFF) and my dog (who laid on the floor for hours beside me on her back during episodes). Forgive me if this is long-winded. I'm slightly high on life. Anyway, my grandfather and dog died one right after the migraines became more frequent. Weekly. Biweekly. Every other day. Every day. Then I feel into a seven day long migraine cycle. I couldn't do anything, not even think through the pain.
