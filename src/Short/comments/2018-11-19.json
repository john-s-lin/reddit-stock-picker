I always hear coworkers complaining about the plastic POS PC computers at our work and always talk about last company where they had Apple computers, but nobody complains about having to use Apple instead of PC. Every year another app comes out that destroys another industry like UBER and all of these new cool companies are working on iPhone and pumping money into Apple services.

Its 80 shippers were all Grade A, and about 85 percent of them had farm bulk tanks. Producers Dairy had $400,000 in retained margins at the time of the merger agreement. Prairie Farms of Southern Illinois also had $400,000 in retained margins from operations in 1958, 1959, and 1960. The total of $800,000 in retained margins was expected to be used for the organization's capital needs. Most of the milk volume at the Springfield plant was diverted to the Carlinville, Olney, and Danville plants by July 1962, although this plant continued to produce some ice cream.\n\n[Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc. : economic impact of a dairy cooperative](https://archive.org/details/CAT83783920/page/6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf those stock certs were never sold, they could very well be worth over $200,000 if not more (depending on how the merger was handled...and the mergers after). I would immediately make a copy of that book I shared above and then [read this from the Illinois secretary of state](https://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/sec338.pdf).\n\n>They should be able to give you a history of the company (when it began, merged, dissolved, went bankrupt, etc.). From there you can contact the existing company (if there is one) to find out the value of your stocks.\n\nI would reach out to the state directly and get the records involving this company and the details surrounding the merger. This way, you'll at least have something to work with as to what you want to do next.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to point out that this company is worth **billions** today. It's the 8th largest privately owned company in St. Louis.  In my opinion, it's safe to assume that even if your stock certs are valid and worth money....the large multi-billion dollar company that exists now will do anything to make it go away in the easiest way possible. **With that, I suggest you consult an attorney after you get the appropriate information from the state of Illinois in regards to the details surrounding the merger.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For some reason I didn't think to continue reading that book. Page 30 & 31 offers clues as to how the mergers were handled and suggests it as a stock-to-stock merger. Producers Dairy isn't specifically mentioned though. After reading into it, it does increase the chances a tad bit in your favor. I still recommend that you reach out to the state and request the actual docs that involved the merger. Specifically, I'd look for: **1)** was it a stock-to-stock merger and **2)** how were the common shares handled? If you can verify through a paper trail that the stock certs wouldn't of been sold off upon a merger....that would give you enough grounds to request that Prairie Farms provide evidence that the position was sold and not some kind of half-assed \"nope. sorry.\" email you may or may not get.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 109, "submission_ratio": 0.01834862385321101, "submission_title": "1930\u2019s Stock Certificates", "submission_text": "We acquired some stock certificates from a cooperative known as Producers Dairy Company out of Illinois which eventually became what is today known as Prairie Farms (acquired in 1960).

October 1, 1960 -- merged with Producers Dairy of Springfield, Ill.**; milk receipts of 40 milion pounds annually from 80 producers; milk was 95 percent bottled and 5 percent used in ice cream; annual sales of $2 million; both milk procurement and distribution area.  \n>  \n>**Comments:** Producers Dairy of Springfield was the largest dairy in Springfield, Ill. Its 80 shippers were all Grade A, and about 85 percent of them had farm bulk tanks. Producers Dairy had $400,000 in retained margins at the time of the merger agreement. Prairie Farms of Southern Illinois also had $400,000 in retained margins from operations in 1958, 1959, and 1960. The total of $800,000 in retained margins was expected to be used for the organization's capital needs. Most of the milk volume at the Springfield plant was diverted to the Carlinville, Olney, and Danville plants by July 1962, although this plant continued to produce some ice cream.\n\n[Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc. : economic impact of a dairy cooperative](https://archive.org/details/CAT83783920/page/6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf those stock certs were never sold, they could very well be worth over $200,000 if not more (depending on how the merger was handled...and the mergers after). I would immediately make a copy of that book I shared above and then [read this from the Illinois secretary of state](https://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/sec338.pdf).\n\n>They should be able to give you a history of the company (when it began, merged, dissolved, went bankrupt, etc.). From there you can contact the existing company (if there is one) to find out the value of your stocks.\n\nI would reach out to the state directly and get the records involving this company and the details surrounding the merger. This way, you'll at least have something to work with as to what you want to do next.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to point out that this company is worth **billions** today. It's the 8th largest privately owned company in St. Louis.  In my opinion, it's safe to assume that even if your stock certs are valid and worth money....the large multi-billion dollar company that exists now will do anything to make it go away in the easiest way possible. **With that, I suggest you consult an attorney after you get the appropriate information from the state of Illinois in regards to the details surrounding the merger.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For some reason I didn't think to continue reading that book. Page 30 & 31 offers clues as to how the mergers were handled and suggests it as a stock-to-stock merger. Producers Dairy isn't specifically mentioned though. After reading into it, it does increase the chances a tad bit in your favor. I still recommend that you reach out to the state and request the actual docs that involved the merger. Specifically, I'd look for: **1)** was it a stock-to-stock merger and **2)** how were the common shares handled?
