Who knows, it maybe a bust, but I've been to shanghai/HK/Beijing recently and it literally is first world city with more lambos and rich people that pay cash for everything. It's common to see Louis Vuitton have lines out the door and people carrying 10 bags out the door paid in cash for their purchases. Mcds/starbucks is also literally LINES inside there. Another reason why I invested into those fast food services.\n\nSQ although hasn't made money is run by a good CEO, and is literally everywhere. Swipe and sign for all small business. Plus they are embracing crypto. It's a good prospect in my opion, and a \"cheap\" pickup compared to V and MA for the time being.\n\nLast speculation stock is ATVI/EA. I personally think we are at a stage where ESPORTS will be huge. The industry has become more considilated where we do triple AAA games with microtransactions. With streamers on twitch, and professional gamers being paid well, its going to be good. It has a HUGE audience, everyone plays fort nite, everyone knows call of duty. We have athletes tweeting about it, and its not \"lame\" to play games no more. It's cool.\n\nRTN and defense stocks on the low...but will always be needed. Safe Stock\n\nNFLX will be around forever and everyone is cutting cable. Safe Stock\n\nAMZN to expensive now...but I will pick up more shares when it dips. Safe Stock\n\nMSFT to expensive now...waiting to pick up more shares when it dips. Safe Stock\n\nMRK solid company and their new cancer drug looks super promising, not much to lose there. Safe stock with big upside potential\n\nDIS solid company and with their property will be around forever, they may pick up in a decade or so. Safe stock but boring for now.\n\nAny thoughts on my portfolio and thoughts?", "score": 8, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 89, "submission_ratio": 0.0898876404494382, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread March 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

No $5000 up front fee and no monthly rental fees. A small business can start accepting credit cards for $0 dollars this is a crucial point for start ups that don't have any capital to waste.\n\nSquare has its own Cash app that rivals apple pay they are the exact same for the most part.\n\n' Not that many places use it' this point being 100% anecdotal to your own experiences. I have seen lots of places using square and when your talking about small bushiness your point can easily be a positive. Yes most small business still use cash, this is rapidly changing as people are being exposed to new technology. ' I can increase revenue by ordering a $0 Square reader?' its a no brainer.\n\nIt has increasing revenue growth quarter over quarter expanding into other countries across the globe. We haven't even begun tapping into the emerging markets.\n\nSquare is increasing its service portfolio to higher margin areas such as square appointments and food delivery service. Square as opposed to apple is trying to make it as easy for start ups, small to medium sized business to operate. Example exporting invoices to quickbooks for easy bookkeeping, ability to create and pay for appointments when the bushiness is not open, ability to accept payments even when internet goes down.\n\nSo that about sums it up. oh not to mention SQ CEO is also the CEO of twitter ( who he started with former google employees) with connections to the best computer programmers in the world.

It is the better technology when looking at small to medium size business setting up point of sale for the first time. No $5000 up front fee and no monthly rental fees. A small business can start accepting credit cards for $0 dollars this is a crucial point for start ups that don't have any capital to waste.    \n\n2. Square has its own Cash app that rivals apple pay they are the exact same for the most part. \n\n3. ' Not that many places use it'  this point being 100% anecdotal to your own experiences. I have seen lots of places using square and when your talking about small bushiness your point can easily be a positive. Yes most small business still use cash, this is rapidly changing as people are being exposed to new technology. ' I can increase revenue by ordering a $0 Square reader?' its a no brainer.\n\n4.It has increasing revenue growth quarter over quarter expanding into other countries across the globe. We haven't even begun tapping into the emerging markets.  \n\n5.Square is increasing its service portfolio to higher margin areas such as square appointments and food delivery service. Square as opposed to apple is trying to make it as easy for start ups, small to medium sized business to operate. Example exporting invoices to quickbooks for easy bookkeeping, ability to create and pay for appointments when the bushiness is not open, ability to accept payments even when internet goes down.\n\n\nSo that about sums it up. oh not to mention SQ CEO is also the CEO of twitter ( who he started with former google employees)  with connections to the best computer programmers in the world.
