You will be able to ride out any bear market (including the Great Depression) if you think 30 years out. Most bear markets recover within 3 years. Follow a buy and hold diversified strategy that invests in stocks, bonds (and possibly real estate.) Dollar cost averaging will serve most investors well since it removes the costly behavioral errors all novice investors make. Disclaimer: This applies mainly to younger investors under 40 years old.\n\nIf you had put all of your money in the DJIA at the top of any bull market (even just before the Great Depression), you would have done okay if you held for 30 years.

You then buy shares in that fund, which corresponds to shares in multiple companies. It's like a mutual fund with less management (the real difference is that the ETF doesn't actually trade the shares at net asset value, they just own stuff and sell themselves). Examples are SPX, which is the S&P 500 and VTI (Vangaurd Total Stock Market). In SPX, you are kind of buying fractions of shares in every stock that is in the S&P 500 (your not actually, you are buying shares of a thing that tracks all of the S&P 500 companies) and in VTI, you are buying shares of something that follows the total value of the market. There are others like XLF (Tracks the financial sector), XLI (tracks the industrial sector), VTV (tracks large cap companies -companies worth more than X-), and many others.   \n\n\nThe nice thing about an ETF is that it is less sensitive to a single fuck up. A good example from last weekend is Twitter (TWTR). After earnings, TWTR crashed hard. A person with all of their money in twitter would have lost a large chunk of it. A person with money in VTI didn't because twitter wasn't a big enough part of the total market to drag it down.  \n\n\nNow, crash resistance is the pro of an ETF. The con is from the exact same effect. TRXC (a smallish biomed company I like to watch that makes surgical robots) has had an AMAZING year, as they appear to be rapidly moving towards profitability. Someone who had invested in them 12 months ago would have a 700% return. Of course, you don't make that kind of money with an ETF. While the dips of a single stock get smoothed out, so do the spikes. The ETF tracks the overall behavior, which, by the law of averages, is much more predictable and more stable. It doesn't rocket up or down (well, unless the entire market/sector/whatever the etf tracks move up or down as a whole).", "score": 5, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 147, "submission_ratio": 0.034013605442176874, "submission_title": "I have saved up $1000 to invest in stocks, what do you think about investing in Microsoft?", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "How does that work?

You then buy shares in that fund, which corresponds to shares in multiple companies. It's like a mutual fund with less management (the real difference is that the ETF doesn't actually trade the shares at net asset value, they just own stuff and sell themselves). Examples are SPX, which is the S&P 500 and VTI (Vangaurd Total Stock Market). In SPX, you are kind of buying fractions of shares in every stock that is in the S&P 500 (your not actually, you are buying shares of a thing that tracks all of the S&P 500 companies) and in VTI, you are buying shares of something that follows the total value of the market. There are others like XLF (Tracks the financial sector), XLI (tracks the industrial sector), VTV (tracks large cap companies -companies worth more than X-), and many others.   \n\n\nThe nice thing about an ETF is that it is less sensitive to a single fuck up. A good example from last weekend is Twitter (TWTR). After earnings, TWTR crashed hard. A person with all of their money in twitter would have lost a large chunk of it. A person with money in VTI didn't because twitter wasn't a big enough part of the total market to drag it down.  \n\n\nNow, crash resistance is the pro of an ETF. The con is from the exact same effect. TRXC (a smallish biomed company I like to watch that makes surgical robots) has had an AMAZING year, as they appear to be rapidly moving towards profitability. Someone who had invested in them 12 months ago would have a 700% return. Of course, you don't make that kind of money with an ETF. While the dips of a single stock get smoothed out, so do the spikes. The ETF tracks the overall behavior, which, by the law of averages, is much more predictable and more stable. It doesn't rocket up or down (well, unless the entire market/sector/whatever the etf tracks move up or down as a whole).", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.2}, {"time": 1533049410.0, "submission_id": "92zf0q", "comment_id": "e3cqrpf", "body": "Stock goes up, stock goes down.

We're going to switch to percents now. You have 100% of your money invested in stocks, 0% in cash. If the market tanks 20%, you \"lose\" 20% of your investment. Not only that, you have no money to deploy to buy some of these stocks which are suddenly on sale.\n\nNow let's rewind, same portfolio total (10,000) but you have 80% of your money in stocks (volatile) and 20% in cash.\n\nThere is a major market crash and the stocks drop 20%. Now you have 8,400 in your portfolio, and your percents are now 76% stocks and 24% cash. However the cash **value** was unaffected. Now you can deploy your 20% cash to the stocks that cut their value. When the market recovers to it's earlier value (in a year or 3), they will recover with those additional shares and you'll have made money.\n\nI personally use this strategy however I keep the \"20% cash\" invested in SPY, wait for Donald Trump to say some stupid shit about Amazon or levy a tariff, then I move the shares from SPY to the individual companies that I invest in. When they recover, I sell them and move back into SPY to keep the 80-20 balance. Basically I expect my underlying stocks to move downward more than the SPY index, so I use the overall movement of SPY (-.4%) to buy a company that is down 4%. When it recovers that 4%, I sell it and buy SPY again. SPY may have swung 1% in that time, but my individual stock swung 4% and I net a profit for myself.\n\nIf you are more conservative or believe a bad market day is coming, I'd say do 60-40 or even 40-60, depending on how you want to insulate yourself from the market.\n\nEdit: also of note, you can reap those sweet sweet SPY dividends if you're crafty. I recently matched the window right and got 200 shares worth of dividends)\n\nEdit 2: As an aside, this is actually how target date retirement funds work. As the retirement date gets closer they change the distribution to be weighted towards more cash and less stocks ie risk. These portfolios are often rebalanced every 6 months to maintain the desired volatility. Ie 50 years out they are 90/10 stocks cash, 40 years out they are 70/30, 10 years out 30/70 or so.\n\n**to be clear,  I am not suggesting anyone do what I am with SPY.

Here is why I added to my position after the sell-off.\n\nI'd be very happy to have discussions with anyone that may disagree/agree.\n\nFirst, a 20-25% sell off makes no sense, it actually made history by shedding the most amount of value in a single day ever by a company. That\u2019s the sort of shit that happens to fraudulent companies uncovered like Enron. Not a 600B company that is growing fast.\n\nTwo main catalysts for sell off: Guidance was lowered over the conference call. In particular, CFO specifically said to expect a high single digit decline in growth every sequential quarter going forward. The other is that expenses will at the same time go up faster and therefore to expect lower margins (40% -> 30%).\n\nSell off is expected with this news, but not 20-25%. Revenue growth was 42% YoY this quarter, which means that a sequential high digit decline implies a 32-34% YoY growth next quarter. That is still an amazing number. I'm actually impressed that the even have this level of growth with how large their company is and the fact that their greatest barrier to growth at this point is the world population. With this sell off, FB trades at a lower earnings ratio than the average SP500 company, despite having a significantly above average growth rate. 17 forward P/E for a company of its safety, size, and growth rate? Count me in. See its PEG. And that's not even considering the qualitative advantages Facebook has.\n\nFurthermore, The \u201chigh single digit\u201d decline is highly attributed to currency headwinds. This quarter, Facebook had a 42% YoY growth but 38% with constant currency. This trend is expected to reverse next quarter (based on current rates). This means that even if Facebook declined say 8%, only 4-5% of the decline can be attributed to the business.\u00a0\n\nThe CFO also has a history of undermining guidance on purpose.\u00a0\n\nThe reason why their expenses are growing and their rev is slowing down is because they are looking long-term, which I love as an investor. Investing into more security, data centers, privacy, etc.. Less ads for now because they will focus on users having richer interactions with each other than just mindlessly feeding spam clickbait content all day.\u00a0This is the right move in the long term, even if it means higher expenses and less ad revenue short term.\n\nNot to mention they have one of the cleanest balance sheets of all time. Zero debt, $45B cash.\n\nYou already know this but Facebook also has a huge moat (competitive advantage). Doesn\u2019t matter if younger people are using it less (don't know why I keep stupid people insisting that is the reason for FB's doom) because they are just migrating to Instagram (less ARPU, yes, but still opportunities there). They also own both the Messenger and WhatsApp, which is has the highest MAU of all messengers including WeChat (which is not even close). They haven\u2019t even monetized it. They own all of social media, and there is zero competition in regards to where advertisers can go to. Not to mention Oculus, AI, etc.\n\nDon't know what more I can expect as an investor -- they are thinking long term, has unbreakable competitive advantages, still has many growth opportunities, and is trading at a fair value (if not cheap).

You might as well buy bonds instead.\n\nWith all due respect, this is a heavy exaggeration. I see the point you are trying to make--growth stocks have the potential to appreciate in stock value at a substantially higher rate than income or value stocks (personally, I try to go for the latter). Facebook is a wonderful example that illustrates your point. It has more than doubled in stock value over the past few years in this bull market. However, Facebook is one of the very select few growth stocks to fulfill and even outgrow its expectations consistently. The fact is, many of these growth stocks are smaller, less-stable companies that are subject to severe price fluctuations, particularly under unfavorable economic conditions--sometimes, these companies don't survive or ever achieve their their former valuations again. The dot-com crash of 2000 is an excellent example of how many internet companies with supposedly high potential for growth ended up losing upwards of 90% of their stock value by the next year (i.e. [Pets.com](https://Pets.com), inktomi, govWorks, [Boo.com](https://Boo.com), GeoCities, etc.) Granted, a few stalwarts such as Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco all survived (and coincidentally pay dividends), but they are still the in the elite category of growth stocks that actually fulfilled their potential. So while you say that one should not expect capital gains with stocks that pay \"consistent income\" (in the form of dividends, presumably), the fact is that the same applies for all stocks; yet the dividends have the ability to either offset losses or even increase capital gains. There is a reason why the arguably greatest investor of the era, Warren Buffett, has consistently bought great companies with good dividends. If you were to take a look into his current portfolio, you'd notice the largest holdings not only pay significant dividends, but growing dividends. Why? Because growing dividends are a sign of a company's financial health. Companies do not pay dividends because they \"cannot find any better opportunities to use its cash for growth.\" The dividend payout ratio is a helpful metric to see how much the company is actually spending on its shareholders. Companies pay dividends to both attract and reward shareholders, but from an investor's perspective, it's a good sign of a company's financial well-being. This is not to say that all companies who pay dividends are financially healthy. Yet the dividends can be a crucial supplement to a good investment; having any sort of guaranteed income is an excellent method to reduce risk, but also boost the gains made from appreciation in stock value. Likewise, they can offset depreciation in stock value. So no, \"might as well buy bonds instead\" is a farfetched exaggeration. For reasons I'm sure I don't have to explain, stocks and bonds are not the same investment. In fact, there are numerous, widespread examples of companies that consistently pay and grow their dividends, while also appreciating in stock value. Companies including, but certainly not limited to: Apple, JPMorgan Chase, and Lockheed Martin all exemplify how guaranteed income with your investment doesn't necessarily compromise growth. As an added bonus to the investor, these are not speculative less-stable companies--these are examples of companies that are here to stay, continue to grow, and pay healthy dividends. After years upon years of an investment in good companies at good prices, these dividends (and if you choose to reinvest them), paired with the growth in value of the companies themselves, will hallmark an excellent investment. So yes, if you conduct the proper research, you *can* expect capital gains. You *do not* have to buy bonds because they are a completely different investment. You *can* make a wonderful return on investment with dividend-paying stocks too. **Capital gains and guaranteed income are not a trade-off.**", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 7, "submission_ratio": 0.2857142857142857, "submission_title": "Did you buy FB stock after the 20% plunge?", "submission_text": "Hi all.\nI bought FB after hours at $171 expecting the stock to progressively climb in the coming weeks.\nAny of you did the same?\nWhat are your thoughts?", "parent_text": "If your goal is consistent income, then I have nothing to say to you.

The metric in itself tells you nothing about the underlying company and is not a sure-tell sign of reducing risk. I do not believe it should be considered at all **if your goal is to maximize your long term wealth**.\n\n**Ironically, the best dividend results will not come from high-yield stocks, but from those with the relatively low yield.** If you pick the right company, so profitable are the results of the ventures spent up by exceptional managements that while they still continue the policy of paying out a low proportion of current earnings, the actual number of dollars paid out progressively exceed what could have been obtained from high-yield shares. Please understand that this belief is founded only given that you pick the right growth stocks, and the internet companies you listed above would be considered poor stock picking.\n\nGiven this historical trend, why should any weight be given to the dividend yield when considering a stock investment? If you pick the right stocks, you actually maximize both capital gains and dividend income.\n\nYou should consider a dividend yield if you absolutely need a reliable, consistent source of income (such as being of old age). However, in other cases, the dividend yield will not \"offset\" any risks in the stock. I would actually consider it riskier since it may alter your decision in purchasing a superior stock with no dividends.", "score": 0, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 7, "submission_ratio": 0.0, "submission_title": "Did you buy FB stock after the 20% plunge?", "submission_text": "Hi all.\nI bought FB after hours at $171 expecting the stock to progressively climb in the coming weeks.\nAny of you did the same?\nWhat are your thoughts?", "parent_text": ">you should expect no capital gains. You might as well buy bonds instead.\n\nWith all due respect, this is a heavy exaggeration. I see the point you are trying to make--growth stocks have the potential to appreciate in stock value at a substantially higher rate than income or value stocks (personally, I try to go for the latter). Facebook is a wonderful example that illustrates your point. It has more than doubled in stock value over the past few years in this bull market. However, Facebook is one of the very select few growth stocks to fulfill and even outgrow its expectations consistently. The fact is, many of these growth stocks are smaller, less-stable companies that are subject to severe price fluctuations, particularly under unfavorable economic conditions--sometimes, these companies don't survive or ever achieve their their former valuations again. The dot-com crash of 2000 is an excellent example of how many internet companies with supposedly high potential for growth ended up losing upwards of 90% of their stock value by the next year (i.e. [Pets.com](https://Pets.com), inktomi, govWorks, [Boo.com](https://Boo.com), GeoCities, etc.) Granted, a few stalwarts such as Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco all survived (and coincidentally pay dividends), but they are still the in the elite category of growth stocks that actually fulfilled their potential. So while you say that one should not expect capital gains with stocks that pay \"consistent income\" (in the form of dividends, presumably), the fact is that the same applies for all stocks; yet the dividends have the ability to either offset losses or even increase capital gains. There is a reason why the arguably greatest investor of the era, Warren Buffett, has consistently bought great companies with good dividends. If you were to take a look into his current portfolio, you'd notice the largest holdings not only pay significant dividends, but growing dividends. Why? Because growing dividends are a sign of a company's financial health. Companies do not pay dividends because they \"cannot find any better opportunities to use its cash for growth.\" The dividend payout ratio is a helpful metric to see how much the company is actually spending on its shareholders. Companies pay dividends to both attract and reward shareholders, but from an investor's perspective, it's a good sign of a company's financial well-being. This is not to say that all companies who pay dividends are financially healthy. Yet the dividends can be a crucial supplement to a good investment; having any sort of guaranteed income is an excellent method to reduce risk, but also boost the gains made from appreciation in stock value. Likewise, they can offset depreciation in stock value. So no, \"might as well buy bonds instead\" is a farfetched exaggeration. For reasons I'm sure I don't have to explain, stocks and bonds are not the same investment. In fact, there are numerous, widespread examples of companies that consistently pay and grow their dividends, while also appreciating in stock value. Companies including, but certainly not limited to: Apple, JPMorgan Chase, and Lockheed Martin all exemplify how guaranteed income with your investment doesn't necessarily compromise growth. As an added bonus to the investor, these are not speculative less-stable companies--these are examples of companies that are here to stay, continue to grow, and pay healthy dividends. After years upon years of an investment in good companies at good prices, these dividends (and if you choose to reinvest them), paired with the growth in value of the companies themselves, will hallmark an excellent investment. So yes, if you conduct the proper research, you *can* expect capital gains. You *do not* have to buy bonds because they are a completely different investment. You *can* make a wonderful return on investment with dividend-paying stocks too. **Capital gains and guaranteed income are not a trade-off.**", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.0}, {"time": 1532934934.0, "submission_id": "92yzyn", "comment_id": "e3a1slf", "body": "YouTube.

What prevents major movie theater companies such as AMC from buying their employees a subscription to Movie Pass and pay them to go see X number of movies at an AMC theater. This can result in massive revenue to AMC theaters at a huge loss to Movie Pass as they will be paying for all of those tickets with borrowed money and only receiving $10 per such a subscriber. Does that make sense? Essentially, AMC can make an unlimited amount of money from HMNY.\n\nMy theory is that Movie Pass was actually created by movie companies in conjunction with Helios and Matheson (HMNY) to boost ticket sales and  bring back the dying interest of going to the movie theaters. Now that millions of people are once again talking about movie theaters and Movie Pass, they can transition all of these users into their own subscription plans and remove Movie Pass from the picture. Unless things change with Movie Pass in the near future, it will either have to be acquired or declare bankruptcy, meanwhile subscribers will have to scramble to find a similar service now provided by movie theater companies. \n\nIn the end, the only losers will be the investors that bought HMNY shares.", "parent_text": "Interesting, thank you.", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}]
