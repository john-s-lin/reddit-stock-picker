NRZ is a bit pricy right now, but is rock solid Mortgage Reit that pays 11%, and has healthy trend lines + earning reports. I have this as an auto reinvest stock in my IRA, and plan on just forgetting about it outside of setting new stop losses every so often to adjust for price growth. Additional REIT stocks that pay nice dividends (4.5-5.1%), are O and STAG. Of the two, I currently own O, however as in NRZ, both feel a bit overbought. If you can put a limit order for around 2-3% less than both, you probably can fill it within a month. Another benifit of these stocks is they pay out monthly.  \n\n\nI also like a technology trust named BST, and have rode it since last year. It has never posted a negative year of more than 3%, has close to doubled from last year, and also offers a 5.1% monthly dividend. Due to their exposure in FB and Netflix, the price has dropped a tiny bit, but will probably recover soon. It won't make you rich fast, but for monthly cash, it\u2019s a good bet and has good underlying numbers in terms of  P/E, indicating the companies they own as part of it are fairly priced\n\n\nAdditionally, if you want to go the safeer route, WMT is always solid long term and pays around the 3% dividend needed for your goal. This is also what is called a \"Fortress\" stock, in that it is recession immune and, if anything, probably will outperform the market should their be a correction/recession soon.

Going through your broker, you likely would need the holding to pay out enough of a dividend for one share.

In classical asset pricing the price of government bonds sets a ceiling (not a floor) for the price of stocks. \n\nFirst thing you have to do is realize P/E is the inverse of E/P and talk consistently one way or the other. If you talk interchangeably you just get confused. For this post I am going to use E/P (yield percentage) followed by P/E (price you are willing to pay for share of profits) in parentheses. \n\nClassically, government bonds are perceived as less risky then stocks (although personally I believe that was 1950s wisdom, not nearly as applicable in 2018) , and therefore stocks should get a lower E/P ratio, by ~10-30%.  Think about it this way: let\u2019s say you have an opportunity to buy a company that the seller says will make you 10% a year for the next ten years. That 10% assumes his business plan works as expected and there is always the possibility of loss. Now say at the same time the government will sell you a 10 year risk-free bond for 15%. You will buy the 15% riskless asset every time over the 10% riskful asset. Hence why the floor is set.\n\n\nCurrently the 10 year yields 2.9%, which is a P/E of 34.5 (2.9%/34.5).  The S&P500 has a current forward of (4.5%/22).   Note that stocks today trade solidly cheaper than the 10 year - what I suggested in the last paragraph would lead you to believe that if bonds are at (2.9%/34.5) then stocks should be at (2.5%/40). Hence why I point out this relationship sets a floor only, not a ceiling. \n\nNow, the question you are asking is \u201cas the 10 year moves from (2.9%/34.5) to  (4%/25) should stocks move from (4.5%/22) to (5.5%/18)? I would answer no. Only when bond rates go past the current equity rate by 10-30% (that equals approximately (5.7%/17) then money would come out of stocks and into bonds.
