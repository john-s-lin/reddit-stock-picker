Those things will likely overwhelm any returns you\u2019d get from the market. Interest rates can be a real killer so don\u2019t underestimate and think you\u2019ll be able to beat them, especially credit cards. Take care of that stuff first if you have it before putting anything into the market.\n\nAfter that, try to establish an emergency fund. Six months worth of expenses is a good starting point. Keep this money in a high interest savings account (right now typically 1.5-2% without jumping through a million hoops). This fund should be used for unexpected expenses like car repairs, healthcare costs, broken sink, etc.\n\nThen have some money in simple checking account to pay your bills while also having a few hundred dollars in wiggle room.\n\nNow that we got the personal finance holy talk out of the way, we can actually move onto the stocks and the market. The first thing you should know and understand is that you should only put money into the market that you can afford to lose. Losing money is a very real possibility and part of the game especially if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. The next two most important things to remember is to have patience and be willing to learn. 99% of people won\u2019t become rich overnight with investing in the markets. Instead, it takes time and a little luck. Don\u2019t expect huge or instant returns and avoid panic selling when things don\u2019t go your way and you see red. You want to make sure you know what you\u2019re doing and understand why you\u2019re putting your hard earned money into a company or fund so make sure you do your research.\n\nNot panicking and selling during tough times is so critical to being a successful investor. If you had done your research and invested in sound companies and funds, your money should recover and then some from down markets as long as the US is in decent shape and the world keeps rolling. For reference, look at how fast many funds recovered after the 2008 recession. A lot of people sold at massive losses while those who were patient, kept their money in the markets, and continued buying made out huge. Recessions are scary as hell but if you\u2019re confident the US economy will continue to operate like it has in the  past then you shouldn\u2019t panic and sell at a loss. Recessions and bear markets have happened and certainly will happen again. Sometimes recoveries are fast and other times they drag but they do typically happen with a healthy economy and market. Recessions and bear markets are ugly and scary but you just have to remain focused and keep on trucking to see the light at the end of tunnel. Stick to your guns. Can\u2019t stress this enough.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to find a broker. Trying googling \u201cbrokers\u201d and see what you like and fits your needs. There isn\u2019t much difference between the big guys. Some common brokers are Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, Charles Schwab, Merrill Edge, and E*TRADE. Robin Hood is a relatively new broker that offers free trades as well. I personally use Vanguard and am happy with them.\n\nIn terms of where to put your money, I\u2019d recommend looking into opening an IRA. Do some research and determine whether a ROTH or Traditional IRA benefits you more. Both have their pros and cons but are great tools to take advantage of. A single individual is allowed to contribute up to $5,500 per year into their IRA. Please note that IRAs are not investments in themselves alone but are instead tax advantaged accounts where you hold your investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds). IRAs allow your returns (interest, dividends, profit from selling stocks) to be tax free. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much money you can save with not having to pay on taxes on these returns, especially over time and as your portfolio grows. Simply put, there is no reason to have and contribute to an IRA if you have the money to.\n\nAs to what to put into your IRA, that\u2019s entirely up to you. If you\u2019re relatively new to investing I would recommend index funds such as a Total Stock Market fund or ones that follow the S&P 500. Index funds are basically are a collection of companies (often hundreds or thousands of them) across various sectors and industries across the world. This prevents you from having all your eggs in one basket and offers diversity which is critical for most successful investing plans. \n\nVanguard also offers what are called Target Retirement Funds that help you plan for your retirement by adjusting your holdings for you over time to meet your risk tolerance and retirement plans. The Target Funds are index funds themselves as well but provide the ability to cater to your needs as you get older and closer to retirement. I\u2019d imagine other brokers offer similar funds as well.\n\nSome solid index funds that make a good backbone to any portfolio are:\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market\nVanguard S&P\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund\nFidelity Spartan 500 Index\n\nI would also recommend allocating between 15-30% of your portfolio towards international index funds. Some examples of these funds are:\n\nFidelity Spartan International Index Fund\nSchwab International Index Fund\nVanguard Developed Markets Index Fund\nVanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to chose between mutual funds and ETFs. Like most things in life, each has its own pros and cons but I typically recommend ETFs as they are nearly always cheaper than their mutual fund equivalents. Mutual funds and ETFs are not accounts themselves and are instead simply types of index or sector funds that hold various companies.\n\nInvesting in individual companies can be profitable but if you\u2019re new to investing or don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing yet, I\u2019d avoid investing in individual companies and stick to the index funds for now. In fact, most people actually have better results over time with index fund investing than they do trying to pick individual companies themselves! When you get your feet wet and become more experienced then you can try investing in individual companies if you wish but I\u2019d avoid them in the beginning. Just remember, you\u2019re going against professionals and computers so it\u2019s unlikely you know something they don\u2019t and a lot of things are often already priced in. That\u2019s what often makes it so tough when picking individual companies and why instead index funds are often the better path for many, especially for novice investors.\n\nIf you want to spice things up a little or want to increase coverage in a particular sector or industry you feel is bound to perform well, you can try sector funds that track certain sectors or industries like healthcare, technology, energy, utilities, defense, etc. There are several mutual funds and ETFs out there that track these things. In fact, it seems like there is a damn fund for anything these days!\n\nMost people recommend a simple three fund portfolio that consists of one fund from my first list and one fund from my second list along with a fund that focuses with bonds such as a Total Bond Fund. I personally avoid bonds myself because I\u2019m on the younger side. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their place and it should be noted they\u2019re absolutely a good part of a portfolio for older folks and those near retirement but for someone who is so young and likely decades away from retirement I don\u2019t see the need for them personally. If you do want to have them in your portfolio at your current age, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going over 10-15% of your portfolio in bonds. Bonds do occasionally outperform stocks some years and tend to be less volatile which is why some folks, regardless of age, like to hold them.\n\nWith a simple 2-3 fund portfolio you should have between 60-85% in a fund that focuses mainly on US stocks or huge companies and then another 15-30% dedicated to international stocks. If you\u2019re including bonds then 10-15% in bonds. You can adjust these percentages as you see fit but those are decent starting points and guidelines for most younger individuals. For example something like a 70-20-10 split.\n\nTry to max out that IRA every year. If you have a 401k plan or something similar, def take advantage of those as well. The tax savings really add up big time over time and as your portfolio grows. I can\u2019t stress that enough. If you don\u2019t have a 401k, then max that IRA first and then look into regular taxable brokerage accounts. HSAs are another thing to think about but that\u2019s for another discussion and I know I\u2019m throwing a lot of stuff at you already.\n\nTry to avoid fees or at least limit them. Buying and holding for the long term helps as well. If you hold for at least a year, you are taxed at a lower rate because they are considered long term capital gains. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much taxes, fees, and commission costs can eat into your earnings. If you don\u2019t need the money right now, look to set your settings to reinvest dividends as this will save you from paying higher tax rates and allow your holdings to grow. Only cash out if you absolutely need the money or if the stock/fund has a really poor outlook/future.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of information to read and digest but hopefully you find it helpful and beneficial. Don\u2019t be afraid to read it, look up certain terms, and then read it again down the line. This stuff can sound complex and seem intimidating at first glance but you\u2019ll find you\u2019ll begin to understand it and grasp it with time and research. It gets easier the more you read. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking an interest in this stuff at a young age. More people should and not enough do. The biggest advantage you have on your side is time. Just remember to be patience, don\u2019t panic sell, do your research, and be consistent with your saving and with investing your money. The returns may not be huge at first but they should grow and become more noticeable over time as your portfolio grows.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 234, "num_replies": 10, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 103, "submission_ratio": 2.2718446601941746, "submission_title": "Young adult with $1000", "submission_text": "Recently, I got myself a job as a delivery driver.

Interest rates can be a real killer so don\u2019t underestimate and think you\u2019ll be able to beat them, especially credit cards. Take care of that stuff first if you have it before putting anything into the market.\n\nAfter that, try to establish an emergency fund. Six months worth of expenses is a good starting point. Keep this money in a high interest savings account (right now typically 1.5-2% without jumping through a million hoops). This fund should be used for unexpected expenses like car repairs, healthcare costs, broken sink, etc.\n\nThen have some money in simple checking account to pay your bills while also having a few hundred dollars in wiggle room.\n\nNow that we got the personal finance holy talk out of the way, we can actually move onto the stocks and the market. The first thing you should know and understand is that you should only put money into the market that you can afford to lose. Losing money is a very real possibility and part of the game especially if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. The next two most important things to remember is to have patience and be willing to learn. 99% of people won\u2019t become rich overnight with investing in the markets. Instead, it takes time and a little luck. Don\u2019t expect huge or instant returns and avoid panic selling when things don\u2019t go your way and you see red. You want to make sure you know what you\u2019re doing and understand why you\u2019re putting your hard earned money into a company or fund so make sure you do your research.\n\nNot panicking and selling during tough times is so critical to being a successful investor. If you had done your research and invested in sound companies and funds, your money should recover and then some from down markets as long as the US is in decent shape and the world keeps rolling. For reference, look at how fast many funds recovered after the 2008 recession. A lot of people sold at massive losses while those who were patient, kept their money in the markets, and continued buying made out huge. Recessions are scary as hell but if you\u2019re confident the US economy will continue to operate like it has in the  past then you shouldn\u2019t panic and sell at a loss. Recessions and bear markets have happened and certainly will happen again. Sometimes recoveries are fast and other times they drag but they do typically happen with a healthy economy and market. Recessions and bear markets are ugly and scary but you just have to remain focused and keep on trucking to see the light at the end of tunnel. Stick to your guns. Can\u2019t stress this enough.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to find a broker. Trying googling \u201cbrokers\u201d and see what you like and fits your needs. There isn\u2019t much difference between the big guys. Some common brokers are Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, Charles Schwab, Merrill Edge, and E*TRADE. Robin Hood is a relatively new broker that offers free trades as well. I personally use Vanguard and am happy with them.\n\nIn terms of where to put your money, I\u2019d recommend looking into opening an IRA. Do some research and determine whether a ROTH or Traditional IRA benefits you more. Both have their pros and cons but are great tools to take advantage of. A single individual is allowed to contribute up to $5,500 per year into their IRA. Please note that IRAs are not investments in themselves alone but are instead tax advantaged accounts where you hold your investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds). IRAs allow your returns (interest, dividends, profit from selling stocks) to be tax free. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much money you can save with not having to pay on taxes on these returns, especially over time and as your portfolio grows. Simply put, there is no reason to have and contribute to an IRA if you have the money to.\n\nAs to what to put into your IRA, that\u2019s entirely up to you. If you\u2019re relatively new to investing I would recommend index funds such as a Total Stock Market fund or ones that follow the S&P 500. Index funds are basically are a collection of companies (often hundreds or thousands of them) across various sectors and industries across the world. This prevents you from having all your eggs in one basket and offers diversity which is critical for most successful investing plans. \n\nVanguard also offers what are called Target Retirement Funds that help you plan for your retirement by adjusting your holdings for you over time to meet your risk tolerance and retirement plans. The Target Funds are index funds themselves as well but provide the ability to cater to your needs as you get older and closer to retirement. I\u2019d imagine other brokers offer similar funds as well.\n\nSome solid index funds that make a good backbone to any portfolio are:\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market\nVanguard S&P\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund\nFidelity Spartan 500 Index\n\nI would also recommend allocating between 15-30% of your portfolio towards international index funds. Some examples of these funds are:\n\nFidelity Spartan International Index Fund\nSchwab International Index Fund\nVanguard Developed Markets Index Fund\nVanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to chose between mutual funds and ETFs. Like most things in life, each has its own pros and cons but I typically recommend ETFs as they are nearly always cheaper than their mutual fund equivalents. Mutual funds and ETFs are not accounts themselves and are instead simply types of index or sector funds that hold various companies.\n\nInvesting in individual companies can be profitable but if you\u2019re new to investing or don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing yet, I\u2019d avoid investing in individual companies and stick to the index funds for now. In fact, most people actually have better results over time with index fund investing than they do trying to pick individual companies themselves! When you get your feet wet and become more experienced then you can try investing in individual companies if you wish but I\u2019d avoid them in the beginning. Just remember, you\u2019re going against professionals and computers so it\u2019s unlikely you know something they don\u2019t and a lot of things are often already priced in. That\u2019s what often makes it so tough when picking individual companies and why instead index funds are often the better path for many, especially for novice investors.\n\nIf you want to spice things up a little or want to increase coverage in a particular sector or industry you feel is bound to perform well, you can try sector funds that track certain sectors or industries like healthcare, technology, energy, utilities, defense, etc. There are several mutual funds and ETFs out there that track these things. In fact, it seems like there is a damn fund for anything these days!\n\nMost people recommend a simple three fund portfolio that consists of one fund from my first list and one fund from my second list along with a fund that focuses with bonds such as a Total Bond Fund. I personally avoid bonds myself because I\u2019m on the younger side. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their place and it should be noted they\u2019re absolutely a good part of a portfolio for older folks and those near retirement but for someone who is so young and likely decades away from retirement I don\u2019t see the need for them personally. If you do want to have them in your portfolio at your current age, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going over 10-15% of your portfolio in bonds. Bonds do occasionally outperform stocks some years and tend to be less volatile which is why some folks, regardless of age, like to hold them.\n\nWith a simple 2-3 fund portfolio you should have between 60-85% in a fund that focuses mainly on US stocks or huge companies and then another 15-30% dedicated to international stocks. If you\u2019re including bonds then 10-15% in bonds. You can adjust these percentages as you see fit but those are decent starting points and guidelines for most younger individuals. For example something like a 70-20-10 split.\n\nTry to max out that IRA every year. If you have a 401k plan or something similar, def take advantage of those as well. The tax savings really add up big time over time and as your portfolio grows. I can\u2019t stress that enough. If you don\u2019t have a 401k, then max that IRA first and then look into regular taxable brokerage accounts. HSAs are another thing to think about but that\u2019s for another discussion and I know I\u2019m throwing a lot of stuff at you already.\n\nTry to avoid fees or at least limit them. Buying and holding for the long term helps as well. If you hold for at least a year, you are taxed at a lower rate because they are considered long term capital gains. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much taxes, fees, and commission costs can eat into your earnings. If you don\u2019t need the money right now, look to set your settings to reinvest dividends as this will save you from paying higher tax rates and allow your holdings to grow. Only cash out if you absolutely need the money or if the stock/fund has a really poor outlook/future.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of information to read and digest but hopefully you find it helpful and beneficial. Don\u2019t be afraid to read it, look up certain terms, and then read it again down the line. This stuff can sound complex and seem intimidating at first glance but you\u2019ll find you\u2019ll begin to understand it and grasp it with time and research. It gets easier the more you read. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking an interest in this stuff at a young age. More people should and not enough do. The biggest advantage you have on your side is time. Just remember to be patience, don\u2019t panic sell, do your research, and be consistent with your saving and with investing your money. The returns may not be huge at first but they should grow and become more noticeable over time as your portfolio grows.\n\nGood luck!", "parent_score": 234, "parent_ratio": 0.10683760683760683}, {"time": 1526779941.0, "submission_id": "8knh8n", "comment_id": "dz9ials", "body": "This could be the longest post I've ever seen on reddit.

Take care of that stuff first if you have it before putting anything into the market.\n\nAfter that, try to establish an emergency fund. Six months worth of expenses is a good starting point. Keep this money in a high interest savings account (right now typically 1.5-2% without jumping through a million hoops). This fund should be used for unexpected expenses like car repairs, healthcare costs, broken sink, etc.\n\nThen have some money in simple checking account to pay your bills while also having a few hundred dollars in wiggle room.\n\nNow that we got the personal finance holy talk out of the way, we can actually move onto the stocks and the market. The first thing you should know and understand is that you should only put money into the market that you can afford to lose. Losing money is a very real possibility and part of the game especially if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. The next two most important things to remember is to have patience and be willing to learn. 99% of people won\u2019t become rich overnight with investing in the markets. Instead, it takes time and a little luck. Don\u2019t expect huge or instant returns and avoid panic selling when things don\u2019t go your way and you see red. You want to make sure you know what you\u2019re doing and understand why you\u2019re putting your hard earned money into a company or fund so make sure you do your research.\n\nNot panicking and selling during tough times is so critical to being a successful investor. If you had done your research and invested in sound companies and funds, your money should recover and then some from down markets as long as the US is in decent shape and the world keeps rolling. For reference, look at how fast many funds recovered after the 2008 recession. A lot of people sold at massive losses while those who were patient, kept their money in the markets, and continued buying made out huge. Recessions are scary as hell but if you\u2019re confident the US economy will continue to operate like it has in the  past then you shouldn\u2019t panic and sell at a loss. Recessions and bear markets have happened and certainly will happen again. Sometimes recoveries are fast and other times they drag but they do typically happen with a healthy economy and market. Recessions and bear markets are ugly and scary but you just have to remain focused and keep on trucking to see the light at the end of tunnel. Stick to your guns. Can\u2019t stress this enough.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to find a broker. Trying googling \u201cbrokers\u201d and see what you like and fits your needs. There isn\u2019t much difference between the big guys. Some common brokers are Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, Charles Schwab, Merrill Edge, and E*TRADE. Robin Hood is a relatively new broker that offers free trades as well. I personally use Vanguard and am happy with them.\n\nIn terms of where to put your money, I\u2019d recommend looking into opening an IRA. Do some research and determine whether a ROTH or Traditional IRA benefits you more. Both have their pros and cons but are great tools to take advantage of. A single individual is allowed to contribute up to $5,500 per year into their IRA. Please note that IRAs are not investments in themselves alone but are instead tax advantaged accounts where you hold your investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds). IRAs allow your returns (interest, dividends, profit from selling stocks) to be tax free. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much money you can save with not having to pay on taxes on these returns, especially over time and as your portfolio grows. Simply put, there is no reason to have and contribute to an IRA if you have the money to.\n\nAs to what to put into your IRA, that\u2019s entirely up to you. If you\u2019re relatively new to investing I would recommend index funds such as a Total Stock Market fund or ones that follow the S&P 500. Index funds are basically are a collection of companies (often hundreds or thousands of them) across various sectors and industries across the world. This prevents you from having all your eggs in one basket and offers diversity which is critical for most successful investing plans. \n\nVanguard also offers what are called Target Retirement Funds that help you plan for your retirement by adjusting your holdings for you over time to meet your risk tolerance and retirement plans. The Target Funds are index funds themselves as well but provide the ability to cater to your needs as you get older and closer to retirement. I\u2019d imagine other brokers offer similar funds as well.\n\nSome solid index funds that make a good backbone to any portfolio are:\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market\nVanguard S&P\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund\nFidelity Spartan 500 Index\n\nI would also recommend allocating between 15-30% of your portfolio towards international index funds. Some examples of these funds are:\n\nFidelity Spartan International Index Fund\nSchwab International Index Fund\nVanguard Developed Markets Index Fund\nVanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to chose between mutual funds and ETFs. Like most things in life, each has its own pros and cons but I typically recommend ETFs as they are nearly always cheaper than their mutual fund equivalents. Mutual funds and ETFs are not accounts themselves and are instead simply types of index or sector funds that hold various companies.\n\nInvesting in individual companies can be profitable but if you\u2019re new to investing or don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing yet, I\u2019d avoid investing in individual companies and stick to the index funds for now. In fact, most people actually have better results over time with index fund investing than they do trying to pick individual companies themselves! When you get your feet wet and become more experienced then you can try investing in individual companies if you wish but I\u2019d avoid them in the beginning. Just remember, you\u2019re going against professionals and computers so it\u2019s unlikely you know something they don\u2019t and a lot of things are often already priced in. That\u2019s what often makes it so tough when picking individual companies and why instead index funds are often the better path for many, especially for novice investors.\n\nIf you want to spice things up a little or want to increase coverage in a particular sector or industry you feel is bound to perform well, you can try sector funds that track certain sectors or industries like healthcare, technology, energy, utilities, defense, etc. There are several mutual funds and ETFs out there that track these things. In fact, it seems like there is a damn fund for anything these days!\n\nMost people recommend a simple three fund portfolio that consists of one fund from my first list and one fund from my second list along with a fund that focuses with bonds such as a Total Bond Fund. I personally avoid bonds myself because I\u2019m on the younger side. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their place and it should be noted they\u2019re absolutely a good part of a portfolio for older folks and those near retirement but for someone who is so young and likely decades away from retirement I don\u2019t see the need for them personally. If you do want to have them in your portfolio at your current age, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going over 10-15% of your portfolio in bonds. Bonds do occasionally outperform stocks some years and tend to be less volatile which is why some folks, regardless of age, like to hold them.\n\nWith a simple 2-3 fund portfolio you should have between 60-85% in a fund that focuses mainly on US stocks or huge companies and then another 15-30% dedicated to international stocks. If you\u2019re including bonds then 10-15% in bonds. You can adjust these percentages as you see fit but those are decent starting points and guidelines for most younger individuals. For example something like a 70-20-10 split.\n\nTry to max out that IRA every year. If you have a 401k plan or something similar, def take advantage of those as well. The tax savings really add up big time over time and as your portfolio grows. I can\u2019t stress that enough. If you don\u2019t have a 401k, then max that IRA first and then look into regular taxable brokerage accounts. HSAs are another thing to think about but that\u2019s for another discussion and I know I\u2019m throwing a lot of stuff at you already.\n\nTry to avoid fees or at least limit them. Buying and holding for the long term helps as well. If you hold for at least a year, you are taxed at a lower rate because they are considered long term capital gains. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much taxes, fees, and commission costs can eat into your earnings. If you don\u2019t need the money right now, look to set your settings to reinvest dividends as this will save you from paying higher tax rates and allow your holdings to grow. Only cash out if you absolutely need the money or if the stock/fund has a really poor outlook/future.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of information to read and digest but hopefully you find it helpful and beneficial. Don\u2019t be afraid to read it, look up certain terms, and then read it again down the line. This stuff can sound complex and seem intimidating at first glance but you\u2019ll find you\u2019ll begin to understand it and grasp it with time and research. It gets easier the more you read.

If you do want to have them in your portfolio at your current age, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going over 10-15% of your portfolio in bonds. Bonds do occasionally outperform stocks some years and tend to be less volatile which is why some folks, regardless of age, like to hold them.\n\nWith a simple 2-3 fund portfolio you should have between 60-85% in a fund that focuses mainly on US stocks or huge companies and then another 15-30% dedicated to international stocks. If you\u2019re including bonds then 10-15% in bonds. You can adjust these percentages as you see fit but those are decent starting points and guidelines for most younger individuals. For example something like a 70-20-10 split.\n\nTry to max out that IRA every year. If you have a 401k plan or something similar, def take advantage of those as well. The tax savings really add up big time over time and as your portfolio grows. I can\u2019t stress that enough. If you don\u2019t have a 401k, then max that IRA first and then look into regular taxable brokerage accounts. HSAs are another thing to think about but that\u2019s for another discussion and I know I\u2019m throwing a lot of stuff at you already.\n\nTry to avoid fees or at least limit them. Buying and holding for the long term helps as well. If you hold for at least a year, you are taxed at a lower rate because they are considered long term capital gains. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much taxes, fees, and commission costs can eat into your earnings. If you don\u2019t need the money right now, look to set your settings to reinvest dividends as this will save you from paying higher tax rates and allow your holdings to grow. Only cash out if you absolutely need the money or if the stock/fund has a really poor outlook/future.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of information to read and digest but hopefully you find it helpful and beneficial. Don\u2019t be afraid to read it, look up certain terms, and then read it again down the line.

It\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking an interest in this stuff at a young age. More people should and not enough do. The biggest advantage you have on your side is time. Just remember to be patience, don\u2019t panic sell, do your research, and be consistent with your saving and with investing your money.

The first thing you should know and understand is that you should only put money into the market that you can afford to lose. Losing money is a very real possibility and part of the game especially if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. The next two most important things to remember is to have patience and be willing to learn. 99% of people won\u2019t become rich overnight with investing in the markets. Instead, it takes time and a little luck. Don\u2019t expect huge or instant returns and avoid panic selling when things don\u2019t go your way and you see red. You want to make sure you know what you\u2019re doing and understand why you\u2019re putting your hard earned money into a company or fund so make sure you do your research.\n\nNot panicking and selling during tough times is so critical to being a successful investor. If you had done your research and invested in sound companies and funds, your money should recover and then some from down markets as long as the US is in decent shape and the world keeps rolling. For reference, look at how fast many funds recovered after the 2008 recession. A lot of people sold at massive losses while those who were patient, kept their money in the markets, and continued buying made out huge. Recessions are scary as hell but if you\u2019re confident the US economy will continue to operate like it has in the  past then you shouldn\u2019t panic and sell at a loss. Recessions and bear markets have happened and certainly will happen again. Sometimes recoveries are fast and other times they drag but they do typically happen with a healthy economy and market. Recessions and bear markets are ugly and scary but you just have to remain focused and keep on trucking to see the light at the end of tunnel. Stick to your guns. Can\u2019t stress this enough.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to find a broker. Trying googling \u201cbrokers\u201d and see what you like and fits your needs. There isn\u2019t much difference between the big guys. Some common brokers are Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, Charles Schwab, Merrill Edge, and E*TRADE. Robin Hood is a relatively new broker that offers free trades as well. I personally use Vanguard and am happy with them.\n\nIn terms of where to put your money, I\u2019d recommend looking into opening an IRA. Do some research and determine whether a ROTH or Traditional IRA benefits you more. Both have their pros and cons but are great tools to take advantage of. A single individual is allowed to contribute up to $5,500 per year into their IRA. Please note that IRAs are not investments in themselves alone but are instead tax advantaged accounts where you hold your investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds). IRAs allow your returns (interest, dividends, profit from selling stocks) to be tax free. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much money you can save with not having to pay on taxes on these returns, especially over time and as your portfolio grows. Simply put, there is no reason to have and contribute to an IRA if you have the money to.\n\nAs to what to put into your IRA, that\u2019s entirely up to you. If you\u2019re relatively new to investing I would recommend index funds such as a Total Stock Market fund or ones that follow the S&P 500. Index funds are basically are a collection of companies (often hundreds or thousands of them) across various sectors and industries across the world. This prevents you from having all your eggs in one basket and offers diversity which is critical for most successful investing plans. \n\nVanguard also offers what are called Target Retirement Funds that help you plan for your retirement by adjusting your holdings for you over time to meet your risk tolerance and retirement plans. The Target Funds are index funds themselves as well but provide the ability to cater to your needs as you get older and closer to retirement. I\u2019d imagine other brokers offer similar funds as well.\n\nSome solid index funds that make a good backbone to any portfolio are:\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market\nVanguard S&P\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund\nFidelity Spartan 500 Index\n\nI would also recommend allocating between 15-30% of your portfolio towards international index funds. Some examples of these funds are:\n\nFidelity Spartan International Index Fund\nSchwab International Index Fund\nVanguard Developed Markets Index Fund\nVanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to chose between mutual funds and ETFs. Like most things in life, each has its own pros and cons but I typically recommend ETFs as they are nearly always cheaper than their mutual fund equivalents. Mutual funds and ETFs are not accounts themselves and are instead simply types of index or sector funds that hold various companies.\n\nInvesting in individual companies can be profitable but if you\u2019re new to investing or don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing yet, I\u2019d avoid investing in individual companies and stick to the index funds for now. In fact, most people actually have better results over time with index fund investing than they do trying to pick individual companies themselves! When you get your feet wet and become more experienced then you can try investing in individual companies if you wish but I\u2019d avoid them in the beginning. Just remember, you\u2019re going against professionals and computers so it\u2019s unlikely you know something they don\u2019t and a lot of things are often already priced in. That\u2019s what often makes it so tough when picking individual companies and why instead index funds are often the better path for many, especially for novice investors.\n\nIf you want to spice things up a little or want to increase coverage in a particular sector or industry you feel is bound to perform well, you can try sector funds that track certain sectors or industries like healthcare, technology, energy, utilities, defense, etc. There are several mutual funds and ETFs out there that track these things. In fact, it seems like there is a damn fund for anything these days!\n\nMost people recommend a simple three fund portfolio that consists of one fund from my first list and one fund from my second list along with a fund that focuses with bonds such as a Total Bond Fund. I personally avoid bonds myself because I\u2019m on the younger side. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their place and it should be noted they\u2019re absolutely a good part of a portfolio for older folks and those near retirement but for someone who is so young and likely decades away from retirement I don\u2019t see the need for them personally.

The Target Funds are index funds themselves as well but provide the ability to cater to your needs as you get older and closer to retirement. I\u2019d imagine other brokers offer similar funds as well.\n\nSome solid index funds that make a good backbone to any portfolio are:\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market\nVanguard S&P\nSchwab S&P 500 Index Fund\nFidelity Spartan 500 Index\n\nI would also recommend allocating between 15-30% of your portfolio towards international index funds. Some examples of these funds are:\n\nFidelity Spartan International Index Fund\nSchwab International Index Fund\nVanguard Developed Markets Index Fund\nVanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund\n\nYou\u2019ll have the option to chose between mutual funds and ETFs. Like most things in life, each has its own pros and cons but I typically recommend ETFs as they are nearly always cheaper than their mutual fund equivalents. Mutual funds and ETFs are not accounts themselves and are instead simply types of index or sector funds that hold various companies.\n\nInvesting in individual companies can be profitable but if you\u2019re new to investing or don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing yet, I\u2019d avoid investing in individual companies and stick to the index funds for now. In fact, most people actually have better results over time with index fund investing than they do trying to pick individual companies themselves! When you get your feet wet and become more experienced then you can try investing in individual companies if you wish but I\u2019d avoid them in the beginning. Just remember, you\u2019re going against professionals and computers so it\u2019s unlikely you know something they don\u2019t and a lot of things are often already priced in. That\u2019s what often makes it so tough when picking individual companies and why instead index funds are often the better path for many, especially for novice investors.\n\nIf you want to spice things up a little or want to increase coverage in a particular sector or industry you feel is bound to perform well, you can try sector funds that track certain sectors or industries like healthcare, technology, energy, utilities, defense, etc. There are several mutual funds and ETFs out there that track these things. In fact, it seems like there is a damn fund for anything these days!\n\nMost people recommend a simple three fund portfolio that consists of one fund from my first list and one fund from my second list along with a fund that focuses with bonds such as a Total Bond Fund. I personally avoid bonds myself because I\u2019m on the younger side. That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have their place and it should be noted they\u2019re absolutely a good part of a portfolio for older folks and those near retirement but for someone who is so young and likely decades away from retirement I don\u2019t see the need for them personally. If you do want to have them in your portfolio at your current age, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going over 10-15% of your portfolio in bonds. Bonds do occasionally outperform stocks some years and tend to be less volatile which is why some folks, regardless of age, like to hold them.\n\nWith a simple 2-3 fund portfolio you should have between 60-85% in a fund that focuses mainly on US stocks or huge companies and then another 15-30% dedicated to international stocks. If you\u2019re including bonds then 10-15% in bonds. You can adjust these percentages as you see fit but those are decent starting points and guidelines for most younger individuals. For example something like a 70-20-10 split.\n\nTry to max out that IRA every year. If you have a 401k plan or something similar, def take advantage of those as well. The tax savings really add up big time over time and as your portfolio grows. I can\u2019t stress that enough. If you don\u2019t have a 401k, then max that IRA first and then look into regular taxable brokerage accounts. HSAs are another thing to think about but that\u2019s for another discussion and I know I\u2019m throwing a lot of stuff at you already.\n\nTry to avoid fees or at least limit them. Buying and holding for the long term helps as well. If you hold for at least a year, you are taxed at a lower rate because they are considered long term capital gains. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much taxes, fees, and commission costs can eat into your earnings. If you don\u2019t need the money right now, look to set your settings to reinvest dividends as this will save you from paying higher tax rates and allow your holdings to grow. Only cash out if you absolutely need the money or if the stock/fund has a really poor outlook/future.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of information to read and digest but hopefully you find it helpful and beneficial. Don\u2019t be afraid to read it, look up certain terms, and then read it again down the line. This stuff can sound complex and seem intimidating at first glance but you\u2019ll find you\u2019ll begin to understand it and grasp it with time and research. It gets easier the more you read. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking an interest in this stuff at a young age. More people should and not enough do. The biggest advantage you have on your side is time. Just remember to be patience, don\u2019t panic sell, do your research, and be consistent with your saving and with investing your money. The returns may not be huge at first but they should grow and become more noticeable over time as your portfolio grows.\n\nGood luck!", "parent_score": 234, "parent_ratio": 0.008547008547008548}, {"time": 1526803604.0, "submission_id": "8knh8n", "comment_id": "dz9wu2e", "body": "Where can you get 2% interest?

I would only have $200 so would day to day even be worth it? Any tips or advise would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: Everyone was extremely helpful! Thank you guys so much!", "parent_text": "First step would be to pay off any high interest loans and credit card debt. Those things will likely overwhelm any returns you\u2019d get from the market. Interest rates can be a real killer so don\u2019t underestimate and think you\u2019ll be able to beat them, especially credit cards. Take care of that stuff first if you have it before putting anything into the market.\n\nAfter that, try to establish an emergency fund. Six months worth of expenses is a good starting point. Keep this money in a high interest savings account (right now typically 1.5-2% without jumping through a million hoops). This fund should be used for unexpected expenses like car repairs, healthcare costs, broken sink, etc.\n\nThen have some money in simple checking account to pay your bills while also having a few hundred dollars in wiggle room.\n\nNow that we got the personal finance holy talk out of the way, we can actually move onto the stocks and the market. The first thing you should know and understand is that you should only put money into the market that you can afford to lose. Losing money is a very real possibility and part of the game especially if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. The next two most important things to remember is to have patience and be willing to learn. 99% of people won\u2019t become rich overnight with investing in the markets. Instead, it takes time and a little luck. Don\u2019t expect huge or instant returns and avoid panic selling when things don\u2019t go your way and you see red. You want to make sure you know what you\u2019re doing and understand why you\u2019re putting your hard earned money into a company or fund so make sure you do your research.\n\nNot panicking and selling during tough times is so critical to being a successful investor. If you had done your research and invested in sound companies and funds, your money should recover and then some from down markets as long as the US is in decent shape and the world keeps rolling. For reference, look at how fast many funds recovered after the 2008 recession. A lot of people sold at massive losses while those who were patient, kept their money in the markets, and continued buying made out huge. Recessions are scary as hell but if you\u2019re confident the US economy will continue to operate like it has in the  past then you shouldn\u2019t panic and sell at a loss. Recessions and bear markets have happened and certainly will happen again. Sometimes recoveries are fast and other times they drag but they do typically happen with a healthy economy and market. Recessions and bear markets are ugly and scary but you just have to remain focused and keep on trucking to see the light at the end of tunnel. Stick to your guns. Can\u2019t stress this enough.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to find a broker. Trying googling \u201cbrokers\u201d and see what you like and fits your needs. There isn\u2019t much difference between the big guys. Some common brokers are Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, Charles Schwab, Merrill Edge, and E*TRADE. Robin Hood is a relatively new broker that offers free trades as well. I personally use Vanguard and am happy with them.\n\nIn terms of where to put your money, I\u2019d recommend looking into opening an IRA. Do some research and determine whether a ROTH or Traditional IRA benefits you more. Both have their pros and cons but are great tools to take advantage of. A single individual is allowed to contribute up to $5,500 per year into their IRA. Please note that IRAs are not investments in themselves alone but are instead tax advantaged accounts where you hold your investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds). IRAs allow your returns (interest, dividends, profit from selling stocks) to be tax free. Don\u2019t underestimate just how much money you can save with not having to pay on taxes on these returns, especially over time and as your portfolio grows. Simply put, there is no reason to have and contribute to an IRA if you have the money to.\n\nAs to what to put into your IRA, that\u2019s entirely up to you. If you\u2019re relatively new to investing I would recommend index funds such as a Total Stock Market fund or ones that follow the S&P 500. Index funds are basically are a collection of companies (often hundreds or thousands of them) across various sectors and industries across the world. This prevents you from having all your eggs in one basket and offers diversity which is critical for most successful investing plans. \n\nVanguard also offers what are called Target Retirement Funds that help you plan for your retirement by adjusting your holdings for you over time to meet your risk tolerance and retirement plans.

Great question OP, hopefully we\u2019ll get some good discussion here.\n\nWith all that said, I\u2019ll try to give my thoughts. Tax benefits can influence the financial figures of companies like the one mentioned because it allows them the ability to apply certain deductions or credits. Tax deductions reduce the amount of income that is taxable. Tax credits can impact the bottom lines and can reduce tax liability as well. Sometimes a company may have a tax credit that actually exceeds what they owe in taxes and in return get refunded money. Stuff like donations/goodwill, if you\u2019re operating at a loss, clean/renewable energy credits, and such can all result in tax benefits like deductions and credits. As you can imagine, tax benefits can influence bottom line numbers on financial statements quite a bit. It\u2019s how you sometimes hear about these massive companies paying less in taxes than you would expect or sometimes nothing. It\u2019s also why companies put so much time, money, and effort into good accounting methods and accountants.\n\nIf I remember and understood correctly, a lot of companies are having kind of fluky financial statements right now with the new tax changes as well. Tax laws are complicated as hell and like I said I\u2019m fair from expert on the matter but if I had to guess the company you\u2019re asking about probably had a combination of quite a bit of tax benefits and some one time adjustments to account for the new tax changes.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 2.0, "submission_title": "Income tax benefit", "submission_text": "Why do some companies, Take Two for example, often get an income tax benefit resulting in income after taxes being higher than income before taxes?", "parent_text": "Income tax benefit Why do some companies, Take Two for example, often get an income tax benefit resulting in income after taxes being higher than income before taxes?", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 2.0}, {"time": 1526853658.0, "submission_id": "8knrmr", "comment_id": "dzawlrs", "body": "With higher taxes and no mortgage interest deduction, income to buy a house in Toronto is gotta be same or higher than $333K. \n*****\n\n\n^Hi! ^This ^comment ^was ^made ^by ^a ^bot ^[[info]](https://www.reddit.com/r/WutbotPosts/).", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "Income tax benefit", "submission_text": "Why do some companies, Take Two for example, often get an income tax benefit resulting in income after taxes being higher than income before taxes?", "parent_text": "Income tax benefit Why do some companies, Take Two for example, often get an income tax benefit resulting in income after taxes being higher than income before taxes?", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1526778107.0, "submission_id": "8knrmr", "comment_id": "dz9gslo", "body": "Did you bother to read their 10-K?
