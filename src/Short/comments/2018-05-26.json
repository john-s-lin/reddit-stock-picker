State Street is up for the year and has paid a dividend since 1910. From its founding 225 years ago, State Street has grown from a small maritime bank into a global financial institution now responsible for 10&#37; of the world\u2019s assets. State Street serves more than 100 markets and is the world\u2019s third\\-largest asset manager, holding $2.7 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2017. State Street also provides custody services to other financial firms, and at the end of 2017 held $33.1 trillion in assets under custody. The business\u2019s fee revenue alone exceeded $2.3 billion in 2017. State Street is also the world\u2019s third\\-largest player in the ETF industry.  \n>  \n>Harris Corp. is another long\\-time dividend\\-payer that has performed well year\\-to\\-date. Harris traces its roots back to 1890 when brothers Alfred and Charles Harris invented an automatic printing press feeder to speed up the traditionally manual process of paper feeding. By 1895 the two had incorporated and set up shop in Niles, Ohio. By the 1940s, Harris had become a leader in the printing press business by focusing on technological advancements. During WWII, Harris got the first opportunity to become the military supplier it is today by helping to develop an innovative sighting system that improved bombing accuracy. In 1949 Harris made one of its most important acquisitions, buying Farnsworth Radio and TV Corporation. Entering the radio industry would change the company forever. Today Harris is a leader in providing communications systems to the military personnel and first responders of the United States and many other countries. Harris also creates systems for electronic warfare, avionics, satellites, undersea systems, and much more. Harris has paid a dividend since 1941 and increased its dividend for 15 consecutive years.\n\nSource: [https://www.younginvestments.com/client\\-letter\\-april\\-2018\\-predictability\\-and\\-consistency/](https://www.younginvestments.com/client-letter-april-2018-predictability-and-consistency/)", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 224, "submission_ratio": 0.004464285714285714, "submission_title": "The world\u2019s 10 biggest dividend payers", "submission_text": "Global dividend payments reached a record high in the first quarter of 2018  according to a study by Janus Henderson.

I spoke of this yesterday in a similar post in that oil is dependent on so many things that it\u2019s tough to truly get an accurate read on the sector. Things that are outside simple supply and demand.\n\nRight now things look more encouraging for the sector as a whole but we\u2019ve seen this before and been disappointed. Do a quick search and see how many posts and articles there has been over the last five years of people speculating that this was the year oil finally turns it around and gets out of its funk, only to once again be proven wrong. It\u2019s not an easy sector to predict and the sector is pretty different than it was 10-15 years ago.\n\nThe sector has been pretty beat up over the past few years but has shown some life in 2018. I think some of things you mentioned may be able to influence things in the right direction for oil investors but I still think there needs to be a few others things and motives to occur to get the ball rolling even further.
