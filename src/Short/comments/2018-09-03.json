Feeling regret that I didn't put more in AAPL and AMZN, but feel glad that I at least invested in them. AMZN in particular though is the second reason why I invested, I feel like I should have just put like most or all of my money in AMZN and an S&P ETF. I could have put a lot more into AMZN but I listened to people saying 'don't ever invest everything into 1 stock', I feel this was fair enough, trump made a tweet about AMZN and it went back down to thirteen hundred something, I felt reassured glad I didn't invest a higher percentage into AMZN, but now I just feel lots of regret. These bull markets won't occur again for another 10+ years. AMZN will never hit 1300 or 1400 again, I've missed the chance. I'm still interested in putting a lot more money into AMZN but I've lost a bit of confidence at the current price of $2000. It's getting very risky at this price point and I'm being greedy, I want high reward without much risk, goes without saying. \n\nNow I'm seeing these weed stocks, I don't know what I'm doing, am thinking about getting into them. Was checking it out a few months ago and people kept saying 'it's too late, if you haven't invested, you've missed your chance' so I left it.

Businesses like Nike don\u2019t become massive by constantly getting into political issues unless from behind the scenes. I hate MJ for not being as much of a role model socially when he could have but the truth is, he is right. Republicans buy shoes, too. Nike most definitely had numerous discussions regarding this and felt that it was something they can benefit from. Would it affect their bottom line? 100%. But it\u2019s impossible to tell if this is due to better competition, bad products, the economy slowing down, etc., and on the contrary, maybe there is reduced competition, continuously growing economy, and great products. Nike has captured a large market share both domestically and internationally. I\u2019m not sure if this Colin thing was a risk worth taking. Are they trying to appeal to liberals or blacks? If they are appealing to liberals, the opposite side might see this as a political war. But how can Nike try to push this message but ignore the harsh treatment of individuals who manufacture their products? If Nike is trying to appeal to the black community, well, honestly most of my black friends loved Nike already so I am not sure if the trade-off is worth it on a larger scale. My opinion is that this won\u2019t affect them long-term but it can escalate much more than this. The entire premise thus far has not included Trump.

Only a select few of them doesn\u2019t have a name on them. Which means who ever holds them are the owner\n4) To trade/concert/digitize them one has to go to a stock exchange ( Chicago or New York for east) \n5) If you want to digitize or convert the stock certificates to your name, you need to have the actual owner sign off a form (I believe in person but not sure)\n6) There are associated fee to digitize/switch owner \n\nSo in short if you are looking to be profitable here you need to find the stock trading in actual stock exchange, get hold of owner and conviene him to sign you off or find a stock certificate without name on it, travel to a stock exchange, deal with the exchange and bear the fees. \n\nOne funny thing you can find is go to google and type in \u201ccompany name\u201d+\u201dstock certificate\u201d\nYou will find hundreds of them being sold cheap which concludes they are worthless in present times.\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 0.75, "submission_title": "Old stock certificates", "submission_text": "I have a ton of old stock certificates I'm looking to do something with.
