This is why the equity market has a higher rate of return than bonds.

The amount of return exceeding Rf that one requires to purchase an asset or investment.\nRa = expected return of the asset or investment.\n\nSince arbitrage does not exist (because arbitrageurs immediately capitalize on any opportunities that do arise and eliminate any further opportunities), we must have that \n\nRa = Rf + Rp\n\nWhat we are seeing today is that Rf is rising and that the Rp one requires is rising (volatility has increased, headline risk like trade wars, privacy issues concerning tech companies, etc., therefore, to purchase stocks, one needs to expect a greater return on those stocks) \n\nThis means Ra < Rf + Rp which can not hold.

When there is a lot of demand for the securities, the price is bid up past its face value and trades at a premium. This lowers the yield that the investor will get since the government only repays the face value on the maturity date. For example, an investor that purchases a bond for $10,090 will be repaid only the face value of $10,000 when it matures. When the Treasury yield falls, lending rates for consumers and businesses also fall.\n\n> If the demand for treasuries is low, the Treasury yield increases to compensate for the lower demand. When demand is low, investors are only willing to pay an amount below par value. This increases the yield for the investor since he can purchase the bond at a discount, and be repaid the full face value on the maturity date.

This is why the equity market has a higher rate of return than bonds. The extra risk one takes on by purchasing equities over a risk free investment such as a t-bill must be compensated by a risk premium.\n\n\n\n\nLaying out a few variables for a simplified model;\n\nRf = Risk free rate (t-bill)\nRp = Risk premium. The amount of return exceeding Rf that one requires to purchase an asset or investment.\nRa = expected return of the asset or investment.\n\nSince arbitrage does not exist (because arbitrageurs immediately capitalize on any opportunities that do arise and eliminate any further opportunities), we must have that \n\nRa = Rf + Rp\n\nWhat we are seeing today is that Rf is rising and that the Rp one requires is rising (volatility has increased, headline risk like trade wars, privacy issues concerning tech companies, etc., therefore, to purchase stocks, one needs to expect a greater return on those stocks) \n\nThis means Ra < Rf + Rp which can not hold.

When there is a lot of demand for the securities, the price is bid up past its face value and trades at a premium. This lowers the yield that the investor will get since the government only repays the face value on the maturity date. For example, an investor that purchases a bond for $10,090 will be repaid only the face value of $10,000 when it matures. When the Treasury yield falls, lending rates for consumers and businesses also fall.\n\n> If the demand for treasuries is low, the Treasury yield increases to compensate for the lower demand. When demand is low, investors are only willing to pay an amount below par value. This increases the yield for the investor since he can purchase the bond at a discount, and be repaid the full face value on the maturity date. When Treasury yield increases, interest rates in the economy also increase since the government must pay higher interest rates to attract more buyers in future auctions.\n\nMany factors affecting this that are somewhat independent of day-to-day market ups and downs.", "parent_score": 14, "parent_ratio": 0.07142857142857142}, {"time": 1524610937.0, "submission_id": "8ely5y", "comment_id": "dxwvgbb", "body": "FYI There has to be a buyer on the opposite side of the people \u201cpulling\u201d their money.

Higher gas prices will pinch consumers, higher wages will pinch companies earnings and they will feed upon themselves. Then with Europe and China which have already started to slow you have the whole interconnected global economy heading the wrong way. \n\nWhat\u2019s interesting and what you\u2019ve seen is from 2015 there has been a synchronized global recovery, that\u2019s ending and now we are getting global divergences. Hence why catapiller beat but once traders heard outlook on the rest of the globe they sold off.  Further you\u2019ve seen the dollar bottoming and actually starting to turn up, this is because in a synchronized global recovery the dollar tends to get ditched for higher yielding assets. Now that those other assets are not looking as attractive (not in a recovery but rolling over from an economic data perspective) money is flooding back into the dollar. Come this summer after inflation gets too hot money will actually start flowing into bonds and you could see the 10 year rally in a massive way (but that isn\u2019t likely to happen for a few months, and rates likely will follow inflation, watch oil).

Apogee Industries\n\nThis company stands out to me for many reasons. Its nice to see that we have such an undervalued company so close to the bottom of its 52 week range. It has fallen more than %18 percent in the last 52 weeks nearing its bottom. Its rocking a P/E ratio of under 16 and a PEG Ratio of 1.24. The fact that it pays a dividend with a payout ratio of of over 20% puts it at around the average of the market in general when it comes to dividend yields. Our price to cash flow is at a great 9.10, followed by a price to sales under 1 and a price book under 3. \n\nThese numbers are good in their own right but what really makes them shine is how it compares to the rest of the industry. These numbers are 2-3x better than the rest of the building products industry. As for the growth of Apogee, its the same story. EPS growth in the last five years is nearly 5x higher, along with the Revenue growth showing the same results. The projected EPS for Apogee is equivalent to the rest, but their revenue and cash flow growth rates is enough for me to strongly state that their EPS projected will be higher than listed.\n\nProfit margins of Apogee aren't anything special, but also nothing to cry about or be deterred away. They stay steady with the industry average. As for returns though? Apogee kills the competition. The average company in building products has a return on equity of -790%!!. Apogee is rocking a pretty 15.80% return on its equity. If you dont know Return on equity (ROE) measures how much a company earns within a specific period in relation to the amount that's invested in its common stock. This is also supported by strong return numbers when we look at their Return on investment which is over 12x higher than the rest.\n\nTotal Debt to Equity of Apogee sits at a beautiful 38%. Of course this isn't the lowest number ever but its fair. How does it compare to the industry? The industry sits at a whopping -2,982%.\nWhen looking at short term debt the current ratio is a great indicator of how well a company can pay back their debt due in a year or less. Many value investors will argue that a current ratio above 1 is good, but I like to take the Graham approach and keep it above 1.5. Apogee is in safe to homeplate with a clean current ratio of 1.78.\n\nOther things we can look at that many people tend to overlook are things such as Earnings yield and turnover rates. Apogee has a great yield that is over 6.47% this is VERY HIGH. Turnover rates essentially establishes the multiple that measures the efficiency of a companies use of assets and cash, and how well debt is used to boost the business' output. Its no surprise that after all these great numbers that Apogee has higher than industry and higher than the market in whole multiples on their turnover rates. No free cash flow isn't good. Some may argue that debt isn't always bad for a company and that is true, but why not have a company that's growing its operation while keeping debt down along with a good amount of cash as a cushion? Apogee does all of this.\n\nOverall, Apogee Industries is a solid company with outstanding fundamentals ( especially compared to its industry, ) Its found a way to turn very high earning's while keeping debt down and in control. They are using their assets and loans to full advantage, while still being able to increase cash flow and revenue.

Its no surprise that after all these great numbers that Apogee has higher than industry and higher than the market in whole multiples on their turnover rates. No free cash flow isn't good. Some may argue that debt isn't always bad for a company and that is true, but why not have a company that's growing its operation while keeping debt down along with a good amount of cash as a cushion? Apogee does all of this.\n\nOverall, Apogee Industries is a solid company with outstanding fundamentals ( especially compared to its industry, ) Its found a way to turn very high earning's while keeping debt down and in control. They are using their assets and loans to full advantage, while still being able to increase cash flow and revenue. ( this is told by their current ratio and interest coverage rates )\n\nLet me know if you guys want more content like this and if you have any questions I'm happy to hear them!\n\n", "parent_text": "Goal1's list of Undervalued Companies Amidst all great gains and exciting volatility in industries such as tech, one cannot help but wonder if there are still any truly undervalued stocks or industries. I for one think its getting tough, but still possible to find companies that are trading way below their proper share price range. \n\nI want to post a stock either once or twice a week that I feel based on fundamentals and Oscillation and Indication events that I can strongly deem very undervalued. You can take this however you want. But I feel it would be nice to have more conversations on the sub that relate to undervaluation with fundamentals in mind. \n\nSo without further ado, here is the first stock of my list that I see making great gains in the coming year and further out.\n\n1. Apogee Industries\n\nThis company stands out to me for many reasons. Its nice to see that we have such an undervalued company so close to the bottom of its 52 week range. It has fallen more than %18 percent in the last 52 weeks nearing its bottom. Its rocking a P/E ratio of under 16 and a PEG Ratio of 1.24. The fact that it pays a dividend with a payout ratio of of over 20% puts it at around the average of the market in general when it comes to dividend yields. Our price to cash flow is at a great 9.10, followed by a price to sales under 1 and a price book under 3. \n\nThese numbers are good in their own right but what really makes them shine is how it compares to the rest of the industry. These numbers are 2-3x better than the rest of the building products industry. As for the growth of Apogee, its the same story. EPS growth in the last five years is nearly 5x higher, along with the Revenue growth showing the same results. The projected EPS for Apogee is equivalent to the rest, but their revenue and cash flow growth rates is enough for me to strongly state that their EPS projected will be higher than listed.\n\nProfit margins of Apogee aren't anything special, but also nothing to cry about or be deterred away. They stay steady with the industry average. As for returns though? Apogee kills the competition. The average company in building products has a return on equity of -790%!!. Apogee is rocking a pretty 15.80% return on its equity. If you dont know Return on equity (ROE) measures how much a company earns within a specific period in relation to the amount that's invested in its common stock. This is also supported by strong return numbers when we look at their Return on investment which is over 12x higher than the rest.\n\nTotal Debt to Equity of Apogee sits at a beautiful 38%. Of course this isn't the lowest number ever but its fair. How does it compare to the industry? The industry sits at a whopping -2,982%.\nWhen looking at short term debt the current ratio is a great indicator of how well a company can pay back their debt due in a year or less. Many value investors will argue that a current ratio above 1 is good, but I like to take the Graham approach and keep it above 1.5. Apogee is in safe to homeplate with a clean current ratio of 1.78.\n\nOther things we can look at that many people tend to overlook are things such as Earnings yield and turnover rates. Apogee has a great yield that is over 6.47% this is VERY HIGH. Turnover rates essentially establishes the multiple that measures the efficiency of a companies use of assets and cash, and how well debt is used to boost the business' output. Its no surprise that after all these great numbers that Apogee has higher than industry and higher than the market in whole multiples on their turnover rates. No free cash flow isn't good. Some may argue that debt isn't always bad for a company and that is true, but why not have a company that's growing its operation while keeping debt down along with a good amount of cash as a cushion? Apogee does all of this.\n\nOverall, Apogee Industries is a solid company with outstanding fundamentals ( especially compared to its industry, ) Its found a way to turn very high earning's while keeping debt down and in control.

Not really unless they really move considerably into pot and none of the big tobacco companies have really said much at all about that. Additionally, they're not going to do anything until broad legalization in the US, which will likely take years. Until then, okay business not great business.
