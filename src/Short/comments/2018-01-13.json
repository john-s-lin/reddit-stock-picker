When equities are hot, nobody wants to have their money in gold, because it doesn't pay interest, so gold will generally tend to go down when stocks go up.\n\nThe magic of bonds is that like stocks they tend to go up over the long term, but will tend to be negatively correlated in the short-term. I'm not sure why you're looking for something to go down. However, if you want the opposite, Long-Term US Treasuries $TLT $VGLT will tend to go up when equities go down, barring inflation.\n\nHere are some bond ETFs:\nhttp://etfdb.com/etfdb-category/total-bond-market/", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 6, "submission_ratio": 0.16666666666666666, "submission_title": "Are there any ETFs where if one goes up the other one usually goes down?", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Are there any ETFs where if one goes up the other one usually goes down?

The market is not cheap now, no question.  It might not be overvalued but it isn't cheap by most metrics.  The almost certain best option you can do is invest in a Roth IRA and a 401K type vehicle that both have tax advantages.  I would also encourage you to read Buffetts letter to the shareholders.  They can be found at Berkshirehathaway.com.  They are basically timeless.  Sometimes I will just pick a random year and read them.  I have reread most of them several times.
