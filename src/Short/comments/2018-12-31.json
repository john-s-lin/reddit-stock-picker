I like when things are kept real.  \n\n> The only good source of revenue is their ads.\n\nAds is their dominate source of revenues. But the fastest growing aspect is actually their non ad business.  Here is their financials.\n\nhttps://abc.xyz/investor/\n\nGoogle accounts for it in \"Other\".  But NOT to be confused with Alphabet \"Other bets\". It makes it a bit confusing to people.\n\n> People hate ads. \n\nPeople get ads are part of life and what they care most about is appropriate ads.  Not things like huge graphics in the screen.  Or ones that take control, etc.\n\nGoogle ads in Search are very low key and do NOT think anyone has much of an issue.   They also do provide some value because of how Google runs the auction.  The auction was key and really smart how Google did it.  I was listening to a podcast yesterday and apparently they stole the idea from someone I had never heard of.   But you have to know what to steal.\n\nYouTube the ads are also handled pretty well.  Do not think they are too obnoxious.    Today with TV there is 18 minutes of ads for every hour.  You do NOT get close to that with YouTube.   \n\nYT really does not have competition and is growing like crazy.  It is now over 1.8 billion hours a day consumed.  So apparently the ads are NOT hurting business.\n\n> A lot of YouTubers don\u2019t like YouTubes bugs. \n\nI have ZERO idea of what \"YouTubes bugs\" you are referring to?  I use YouTube everyday and a lot and do NOT experience any bugs.  So can't help you there.\n\nI do think if there were \"bugs\" we would hear about it.  When you have 1.8 billion hours consumed a bug is going to be well known.  It is the #2 most popular web site in the world and one of the most popular apps.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps\n\nGoogle actually owns 5 of the top 7 most popular apps used on ALL smartphones in the world.  They also have 2 of the most popular web sites and 26 of the top 100.\n\nThere is some bitching about YouTube in the process of them trying to clean it up.   But we can see the growth continues uninbated so does not seem to hurt business.\n\nAt this point it would be impossible to create a true YouTube competitor.\n\nThe reason is Google lucked into the timing.  Something like YouTube became possible and that is where all the video content was posted over the 10+ years.    It would be impossible to get people to post all of that video again.\n\nBut it is the efficiency from scale that would make it very difficult in addition.  Google built out the infrastructure through the years and now has far less cost then someone just starting up.  \n\nCost would be huge to create a new service.   Scale is a strong moat builder.\n\n>  but that came at the cost of being a very scummy company. \n\nActually do NOT think Google is any more scummy then any other company.     Take China.  Google left in 2010 and walked away from billion because it was the right thing to do.  Versus Microsoft has a censored search engine in China.  But for a while even worse.\n\n\"Bing censoring Chinese language search results for users in the US\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/11/bing-censors-chinese-language-search-results\n\nIn China we had \n\n\"Apple drops hundreds of VPN apps at Beijing\u2019s request\"\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc\n\nVs \n\n\"Bypass China\u2019s Great Firewall with Google Project Fi\"\n\nhttps://hackernoon.com/bypass-chinas-great-firewall-with-project-fi-14b58b90fab5\n\nBut the big thing is Google has NEVER charged a cent for anyone to use their IP.   Not a single cent.  Now not the best business approach but what it allows is Google to have\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/12/23000-millennial-and-gen-z-workers-listed-their-dream-employers.html\n\nPlus be the top place to work six years in a row.\n\n\"Google is named Fortune's top place to work for 6th year in a row\"\n\nUltimately we do NOT know the future.  But we do know engineers are what is going to enable your company to be successful.\n\nGoogle being the top desired place to work and having better retention is like a single NFL team getting all the top draft choices year in and year out.\n\nThen doing things like ending their use of AI to help the US military goes a very long way with young people wanting to work there.\n\nOn AI.  It is the future.  Google leads in every layer of the AI stack. Plus where much of the big breakthroughs come from.  Things like GANS or so many other examples.\n\nBut Self driving cars is over a trillion a year opportunity.  But it will take a long time to get there.  IT is a perfect area to fuel growth for decades.   It is like Amazon and ecommerce.  Huge market that has fueled their growth for over 2 decades now and continues.  But then it created the AWS opportunity.\n\nSDC is perfect for Alphabet.  Ads will slow down as their is just so much available.   Google and FB now have, I believe, over 50% of what is spent.  Do NOT hold me to that numbers but a material amount.  Eventually that will slow.\n\nSDC - Self Driving Cars.\n\ni will make a wild prediction.  I bet Waymo will make ZERO money for at least 5 years and probably 10 and that is a good thing.   If successful it should NOT make money but grow like crazy.\n\nWaymo employees ONLY get Waymo shares.  Phantom shares.  NO Alphabet.  They will spin out which will be very good for Alphabet shareholders.\n\nI bet they will spin out.  Waymo though will NOT make a dollar and have a market cap of over $100 billion.  I have owned Amazon since the IPO. I fought over and over and over again on the value of Amazon.  Even though made NO money.\n\nWe are going to have that exact same thing again with Waymo.  And once again it will make perfect sense.  But even longer then Amazon stretch of being unprofitable.\n\nIt is NOT simply about transportation.  It is also about shipping/logistics.   That stack is worth even more than transportation.\n\nGoogle has over $100B cash with no dividend, $6B debt, and does NOT do material buybacks.  Why would you ever sit on that much cash?\n\nReason being is to build out SDC both transportation and shipping/logistics.  It will literally cost over $100B to do it.\n\nI know this all sounds crazy to some.  But it is what it is.\n \nI am very bullish on Google.   My #2 is Amazon.

IT is a perfect area to fuel growth for decades.   It is like Amazon and ecommerce.  Huge market that has fueled their growth for over 2 decades now and continues.  But then it created the AWS opportunity.\n\nSDC is perfect for Alphabet.  Ads will slow down as their is just so much available.   Google and FB now have, I believe, over 50% of what is spent.  Do NOT hold me to that numbers but a material amount.  Eventually that will slow.\n\nSDC - Self Driving Cars.\n\ni will make a wild prediction.  I bet Waymo will make ZERO money for at least 5 years and probably 10 and that is a good thing.   If successful it should NOT make money but grow like crazy.\n\nWaymo employees ONLY get Waymo shares.  Phantom shares.  NO Alphabet.  They will spin out which will be very good for Alphabet shareholders.\n\nI bet they will spin out.  Waymo though will NOT make a dollar and have a market cap of over $100 billion.  I have owned Amazon since the IPO. I fought over and over and over again on the value of Amazon.  Even though made NO money.\n\nWe are going to have that exact same thing again with Waymo.  And once again it will make perfect sense.  But even longer then Amazon stretch of being unprofitable.\n\nIt is NOT simply about transportation.  It is also about shipping/logistics.   That stack is worth even more than transportation.\n\nGoogle has over $100B cash with no dividend, $6B debt, and does NOT do material buybacks.  Why would you ever sit on that much cash?\n\nReason being is to build out SDC both transportation and shipping/logistics.  It will literally cost over $100B to do it.\n\nI know this all sounds crazy to some.  But it is what it is.\n \nI am very bullish on Google.   My #2 is Amazon.  Those two, imo, are just on a different level then the others.  It is a bit amazing the two were named as they were.

But you have to know what to steal.\n\nIf you can think of the podcast I'd be interested in listening.   Google Search ads are some of the best performing digital ads outside of something like email.   \n\nGoogle uses a second price auction where you essentially pay a penny more then the next highest competitor.   They also use something called quality score to help determine your ad rank, and then combine this to figure out the cost per click.   \n\nThe whole Google search ads system is pretty impressive.   They've expanded this to things like Google shopping which is great if you have an ecommerce store.   \n\nThis is without even getting into other parts of Google's advertising products.
