However, the market value of the stock doesn't move in percentages. What I mean is, if there is a negative earnings release, the market participants should think \"Company A is worth $90b instead of $100b because of that.\" If the earnings release turned out to be false, the market would then think \"Oh, so Company A is still worth $100b after all.\" As opposed to Company A being worth 10% less and then 10% more again.\n\nWhere I see this applicable is if you book a 10% loss on a position, say Stock A, and then move the capital to Stock B. In that case you would need an unrelated 11% gain on the new position to break even.\n\nIn my view this is generally semantics when measuring percentages as opposed to dollar amounts, as with percentages, the market is changing your reference or base value or whatever on a daily basis.

However, the market value of the stock doesn't move in percentages. What I mean is, if there is a negative earnings release, the market participants should think \"Company A is worth $90b instead of $100b because of that.\" If the earnings release turned out to be false, the market would then think \"Oh, so Company A is still worth $100b after all.\" As opposed to Company A being worth 10% less and then 10% more again.\n\nWhere I see this applicable is if you book a 10% loss on a position, say Stock A, and then move the capital to Stock B. In that case you would need an unrelated 11% gain on the new position to break even.\n\nIn my view this is generally semantics when measuring percentages as opposed to dollar amounts, as with percentages, the market is changing your reference or base value or whatever on a daily basis.

People need to separate their adoration and fawning all over him with their investment sense. I don't care what anyone thinks of analysts, you just absolutely don't do what he did - and he should have outright apologized rather than taking it even further with his tweets the day after.

Look at how Bezos responded to Trump (answer: he didn't.) Elon is talking about how he's in \"production hell\" and \"sleeping on the couch at the factory\" and shit, but Buffett says one thing about candy and he instantly appears to be all \"challenge accepted\" and tweets about it well into the night. His trolling Berkshire last night is not how a CEO should act - linking to clips from \"Trolls\" and nonsense like that.\n\nIf anyone high up at Tesla cared or had any sense, they'd be like, \"Dude, stop tweeting\" before he really tweets something that becomes a regulatory issue.\n\nI'm not short, I *hate* being in the middle of drama in my investments - but I'm fascinated with how many red flags keep appearing with Tesla and his behavior.

I think he's highly intelligent, but the behavior and \"rules don't apply to me\" mentality (he can't be constantly tweeting about the company during the quiet periods) should be appaling. I'm also highly skeptical of a lot - the whole \"I'm sleeping on the couch\" stuff is eaten right up by his fanbase.\n\nAdditionally, CEOs who are that obsessed with shorts (and who shut down analysts and call their questions boneheaded on conference calls) should be highly, highly concerning to investors. People need to separate their adoration and fawning all over him with their investment sense. I don't care what anyone thinks of analysts, you just absolutely don't do what he did - and he should have outright apologized rather than taking it even further with his tweets the day after. His saying that \"the analysts are working for the shorts!\" is ridiculous and wrong.\n\nYou also don't do what he's doing right now and talking up how the stock is going to have an enormous short squeeze.\n\nI mean, really - Elon may be intelligent, but he should learn from Bezos on how to behave like an adult. Look at how Bezos responded to Trump (answer: he didn't.) Elon is talking about how he's in \"production hell\" and \"sleeping on the couch at the factory\" and shit, but Buffett says one thing about candy and he instantly appears to be all \"challenge accepted\" and tweets about it well into the night. His trolling Berkshire last night is not how a CEO should act - linking to clips from \"Trolls\" and nonsense like that.\n\nIf anyone high up at Tesla cared or had any sense, they'd be like, \"Dude, stop tweeting\" before he really tweets something that becomes a regulatory issue.\n\nI'm not short, I *hate* being in the middle of drama in my investments - but I'm fascinated with how many red flags keep appearing with Tesla and his behavior.

So about 10 days ago I decided to buy 3 stocks consisting of 3 of the 5 largest banks in Indonesia with nearly equal portions each.\n\nMy reasoning was that:\n\n1. I wanted to be safe so let's buy large banks stocks. Historically, the 1-year return was very good, 30%-40% and had always grew YoY. There's no chance of these banks going bankrupt.\n\n2. I thought in May, the price would soar, so I decided to buy a lot because I thought now is a good entry point.\n\n3. At first I wanted to invest and not trade. So I thought I wouldn't mind the volatility but now it got scary.\n\nI decided to spend about 75% of my asset to these 3 stocks. Shockingly, once I bought, the price dropped ridiculously since the very same day until now. Many believe that it will continue to drop until about September. This is so frightening.\n\nMy mistake was:\n\n1. I didn't set any cut loss point. I thought I was gonna go for long term and I didn't think it was gonna end up this bad anyway. My mentality was \"I just lose money on paper, but one day the trend will reverse inevitably\". I thought I was gonna go for long term, but apparently I need the money to make more money. \n\n2. I invested too much for the first time, instead of doing a trial first. I really thought It was gonna go up.\n\nPlease help me how can I save these stocks? I'm thinking to average down once it reaches it's lowest point. I can't afford to lose this much as a beginner.\n\nAlternatively, should I stop thinking about these 3 stocks at the moment and use what's left for investing in good bullish stocks?\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\nEDIT: Here's the stocks that I bought.\n\nOn 24/04 : https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BNGA:IJ\n\nON 25/04 : https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BBNI:IJ, https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BMRI:IJ", "parent_text": "My stocks have dropped 15% in 10 days.

You bought right after earnings.  It's better to wait for a dip after good earnings, unless you're adding to already existing shares or there is something extraordinary about the particular earnings.\n\n3) The company's reps didn't show much confidence when talking about earnings and emphasis seemed to be placed on loan growth.  It looks like there are some changes to their structure in the loan department which means new territory for them.  So they really don't know how that area will perform compared to previous years.  \n\n4) Again Im from the U.S., but politics play a huge role in stock market performance especially when it comes to bank stocks and it looks like there could be a change in Indonesia's political climate as it relates to Malaysia.  \n\nI say all this to say.  The company looks great just skimming through fundamentals.  Technicals look weak.  You've only been in the stock 5 days and you shouldn't be panicking this early.  If you're going to long term invest you need to give it at least 2 financial quarters to perform.  But at the same time if you need this money that you've invested then you need to pull out.  \n\nNever invest money you're not willing to lose.  Investing should be as stress free as possible.

You bought right after earnings.  It's better to wait for a dip after good earnings, unless you're adding to already existing shares or there is something extraordinary about the particular earnings.\n\n3) The company's reps didn't show much confidence when talking about earnings and emphasis seemed to be placed on loan growth.  It looks like there are some changes to their structure in the loan department which means new territory for them.  So they really don't know how that area will perform compared to previous years.  \n\n4) Again Im from the U.S., but politics play a huge role in stock market performance especially when it comes to bank stocks and it looks like there could be a change in Indonesia's political climate as it relates to Malaysia.  \n\nI say all this to say.  The company looks great just skimming through fundamentals.  Technicals look weak.  You've only been in the stock 5 days and you shouldn't be panicking this early.  If you're going to long term invest you need to give it at least 2 financial quarters to perform.  But at the same time if you need this money that you've invested then you need to pull out.  \n\nNever invest money you're not willing to lose.  Investing should be as stress free as possible.
