Think Oracle, for example, who has been stagnant in the market and with news.\n* They buy up companies and integrate their tech constantly. \n* They just bought up a 40 story building in NYC for more offices. \n* Once you buy into their ecosystem, it's a one stop shop and you never need to leave - in fact having to leave would be such a pain, you're probably a customer for life. \n* They churn account managers yearly who push for you to buy things before their term is up because that's their paycheck, so account growth is constant. \n* they charge a ton for their services because they work and once you're in their ecosystem, you need to either use what they have, find another ISV, or build it yourself - which is great because you can indeed go around them but still benefit from the Salesforce platform. The startup cost to get you hooked is actually free btw.\n* they offer free training for admins and developers to learn their Apex code and ecosystem. In fact, a concern I hear from customers constantly is that there aren't enough Salesforce developers (probably why the training is free)\n* They support companies with free \"Ignite\" sessions to help you with issues or help you develop something innovative. \n* They have a yearly event called Dreamforce that shuts down San Francisco for a week and they have to get a cruise ship every year to act as a hotel in the harbor because the event is so popular it fills up every single hotel in the city and around it. \n* They're more than just a CRM company, which is why I bought so many shares last year. You want something that you can code once and have it work on all devices while pulling data from your CRM? Done. They bought Heroku. You want to manage inside and outside sales people and plan delivery routes using data from your CRM? Done - get MapAnything and install it into your Salesforce instance. Erp system? Done. Ascent. Marketing ? Done. Marketing cloud or Pardot. Service and sales? Done. Sales cloud. You want to build a custom website with no coding experience and essentially pennies per license for named users and gated content from your CRM? Done - use their built in Communities. Want to deliver e-learning and track all results with data in your CRM? Done. Use Appinium's LearnTrac/ViewTrac products. \n* What I'm saying is, their ability to make ridiculous tech stacks already exists and companies are flocking to Salesforce because of it. Theres still huge potential for growth from new customers and existing customers. Red Cross just hopped on recently and that is a HUGE win for Salesforce. Developers are also flocking to Salesforce app exchange to build apps or API connectors they can offer to have their platforms sync with your Salesforce database.\n\n\nThe company is fresh, fairly new, branded well, and is growing in so many ways, I see it growing consistently for years to come. Mark Benioff has a laid back, can do and will do attitude, which really helps considering its San Fran founding. The guy grew up in Hawaii so he passes along a lot of that laid back chill mentality to his company. I genuinely have a lot of fun at Dreamforce and I can see why people like working there.

Since past trends/performance don't indicate future trends/performance, what are your thoughts on how the next recession might deviate from past recessions? I know a real answer to this would require a crystal ball, but generally speaking, the current global economic and political climate leads me to believe that monetary policy and trade will play a larger role in the next market downturn as opposed to another bubble popping. If that's the case, I'm wondering if there are particular recession indicators to focus on or if the weighting of some of the existing indicators should be adjusted to account for this possibility (at least to compare to an equally weighted recession indicator model).\n\n2. Secondly, relative to the '01 and '08 crashes, there appears to be much greater awareness and skittishness among investors regarding a pending recession. I'm very interested in what impact this increased awareness might have on the recession (e.g. Will this all get \"priced in\" and reduce the severity of the crash? Will this increase the role of behavioral economics and make the recession less predictable based on prior indicators?).", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 8, "submission_ratio": 0.25, "submission_title": "(10/10) - Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "submission_text": "#Good morning traders of the r/stocks sub!

Not much more downside risk. We'd have to fall into recession for them to drop below $40 IMO.\n- NVDA has a strong history of epic springboard reversals when they pierce their lower bollinger band even though their price is still high.\n- AAPL is nice and cheap going into earnings. May get cheaper but probably not by too much.\n- UNP also had its worst one-day selloff since 2014 on no bad news when the company is extremely healthy just because Dow Transports cratered. Absolutely no reason for it to fall like it did.\n- BA probably has more to fall, but if they aren't well over 400 next year barring a general market drawdown I'll eat my hat. They start leveling off, I'd start scaling in.\n- SNE fundamentals are awesome, they're very low on their band which they typically rise from, and they're going into their strongest part of the year.\n- TSLA has a strong history of springboarding off levels like this just like NVDA, but their fundamentals are atrocious in comparison so a much riskier play.\n- MU for a long play if you don't mind the likelihood of more downside and being dead money for a quarter or two in order to get a good price now and have it pay off in spades next year when investors finally wake up to the fact that the DRAM cartel is in control now, not a boom-bust field of 10 competitors murdering each other.\n\nI'd stay AWAY from overvalued hype bubble stocks like AMD, SQ, and ROKU.

Not much more downside risk. We'd have to fall into recession for them to drop below $40 IMO.\n- NVDA has a strong history of epic springboard reversals when they pierce their lower bollinger band even though their price is still high.\n- AAPL is nice and cheap going into earnings. May get cheaper but probably not by too much.\n- UNP also had its worst one-day selloff since 2014 on no bad news when the company is extremely healthy just because Dow Transports cratered. Absolutely no reason for it to fall like it did.\n- BA probably has more to fall, but if they aren't well over 400 next year barring a general market drawdown I'll eat my hat. They start leveling off, I'd start scaling in.\n- SNE fundamentals are awesome, they're very low on their band which they typically rise from, and they're going into their strongest part of the year.\n- TSLA has a strong history of springboarding off levels like this just like NVDA, but their fundamentals are atrocious in comparison so a much riskier play.\n- MU for a long play if you don't mind the likelihood of more downside and being dead money for a quarter or two in order to get a good price now and have it pay off in spades next year when investors finally wake up to the fact that the DRAM cartel is in control now, not a boom-bust field of 10 competitors murdering each other.\n\nI'd stay AWAY from overvalued hype bubble stocks like AMD, SQ, and ROKU. They could reverse at any time and FOMO will kick in from retail, but downside risk is enormous.
