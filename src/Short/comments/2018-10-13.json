Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946.

The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.

Now let\u2019s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn\u2019t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row\u2014one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.\n\n> \u201cSome pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,\u201d said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Stocks-are-Usually-Strong-After-a-Midterm-Election.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# So \u201cSell in May\u201d Didn\u2019t Work This Year?\n\n> Not so fast. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow\u2019s and S&P\u2019s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ\u2019s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. \n\n> The market\u2019s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it\u2019s down 5.0% at yesterday\u2019s close. \n\n> The past two days have reminded everyone of October\u2019s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October\u2019s scary record. \n\n> \u201cThe term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens\u2026. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.\u201d \n\n> October isn\u2019t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let\u2019s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it\u2019s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ\u2019s Best 8 Months. \n\n> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud \u201cshould I sell?\u201d And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3db094e08a5aadfb801df5fa788f081/tumblr_inline_pghtq0CzyB1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 12th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.14.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$IBM** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$ISRG** \n> * **$SCH** \n> * **$GWW** \n> * **$CSX** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$WGO** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$NUE** \n> * **$SLB** \n> * **$HON** \n> * **$CMA** \n> * **$BX** \n> * **$SKX** \n> * **$KMI** \n> * **$PG** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$URI** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$URAL**\n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$FHN** \n> * **$ETFC** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$PM** \n> * **$STI** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$TXT** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$BBT** \n> * **$CREE**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aHxgRUO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/g06Zcn0.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HMReLun.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 10.15.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fnMjMUy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sPiKAD8.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 10.16.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MbcTgzE.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JD7glYw.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 10.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1CUQ1jg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8u6ga3N.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.18.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjqrGiU.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x9KVMIJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.19.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n*****\n\n# Netflix, Inc. $339.56\n> **Netflix, Inc.
