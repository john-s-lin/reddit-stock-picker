The other side of the coin(which i personally believe too) is that premium cellphone market is cyclical, no one buys a new 800$+ phone every year and its stupid to expect high quarterly growth, the damnd surges and then gradually weakens until there is another big year release phones. Their guidance wasn't even like shockingly lower or something, it still includes the average expectations in its range. so its more due to an overreaction that people will never buy expensive phones again.

The other side of the coin(which i personally believe too) is that premium cellphone market is cyclical, no one buys a new 800$+ phone every year and its stupid to expect high quarterly growth, the damnd surges and then gradually weakens until there is another big year release phones. Their guidance wasn't even like shockingly lower or something, it still includes the average expectations in its range. so its more due to an overreaction that people will never buy expensive phones again.

Think of it this way: you have two separate child care centers - one is a fully functioning, top of the line, nationally accredited facility and their reputation allows them to be enrolled at or above capacity; the other is a struggling small business who can't seem to keep staff or children in the building for various reasons. The former's toddler room is enrolled at its maximum of 14 with two teachers. The latter's toddler room has five kids in it and one teacher. Bright Horizons calls the former first, and they politely inform them that there's no room for their client's child on that day. They call the second, who take the child on because all money is good money.\n\nAt the end of the day, Bright Horizons is back-up care. The kind of people who use it are working professionals, yes, because it costs a lot of money (the provider sees $75 after Bright Horizons' substantial cut), but they just need their kid safe *one day* because of a big meeting at work that conflicts with grandma's appointments. You will indeed find back-up care is more prevalent in higher-income areas compared to centers with a huge proportion of families on childcare assistance.\n\nAgain, they can gouge prices like that because the providers need enrollment. Same reason that companies who provide teaching temps can charge businesses $18/hr for an aide. Ratios and labor costs do a complex dance in the childcare business.\n\nI see no reason you're going to lose money. You may not make a ton.
