Many of them are legitimate and decent companies and not pump/dumps or scams, they\u2019ve just experienced incredible runs, offer something unique or exciting, or are really hyped up by the media. Just because they\u2019re overvalued or overhyped doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad companies and unworthy of debate or discussion. It\u2019s not really something you can avoid either and let\u2019s face it, talking about companies like JNJ, Ford, or Comcast aren\u2019t exactly the most exciting of topics to discuss.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t fault or criticize the companies. Instead, we should fault the individuals who fail to put in the time and effort to research these companies and instead invest in whatever the hot stock of the week is. That\u2019s their fault and their own failure. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with investing in companies like IQ, MU, AMD, Tesla, or JD as long as you performed your own research and got in at a relatively reasonable price. I invested in IQ myself in early June at the start of its crazy run up and continue to confidently hold it today but even I knew the run up it had was too extreme and unlikely to continue/maintain. It didn\u2019t matter much to me as I\u2019m holding it long term but you\u2019d be nuts to be buying in at mid 40s and thinking a dip wasn\u2019t around the corner. The mistake is blindly jumping into these stocks right after hitting all time highs and massive run ups.\n\nThese are real and legit companies, not memes.

The problem is not with IQ, it is with the experience level of the people who may read about them here and think they need to jump in just because some stranger said its a good play. \n\nThose people need to learn the difference between \"fundamental\" analysis and \"momentum\" stocks. A momentum stock is going higher solely because people believe it has a great future - even if it has no earnings. These can be real stocks that eventually become Amazon, or they can be turkeys that become GoPro.\n\nBut it is not MY responsibility to warn anyone here on what is or isn't a worthwhile stock. Right now Morningstar has Tesla rated as an F (lowest) rating stock, rightfully so, however many people have made money in it. The same with Square (F by MorningStar) but both are big momentum plays right now - and not purely meme stocks.\n\nThe question for any investor on any given stock is \"how much do you know about it?\" For example; its product, its earnings, its float, its liquidity, its moat and the possibility that it might actually have potential.\n\nIt would be too easy to call TWTR, MU, NFLX or AMD meme stocks when in fact they are are real companies with legitimate niches and stories. Yes, they are all overpriced or speculative, but so are a lot of other stocks that become the real deal some day.\n\nI do believe that with companies like IQ, HUYA, and JD.com it is a good idea to mention that they are Chinese stocks and that not much is really known about them. But anyone who buys these stocks just because they see them mentioned here (or on Cramerica) should not then come in here and ask us what they should do. THEY bought the stock which makes them the expert on it. \n\nSo, if we are to ban anything, I suggest banning \"I own XXXX, what should I do?\" questions.
