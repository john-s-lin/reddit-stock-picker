If breaks above 5, do I take profit or do I hold expecting 5.6, 6.0? \n\nJumping into a stock with no familiarity with the daily, hourly, charts is very hard to pull off.

Today, some news was announced that to me, at face value seemed very positive, but is slightly over my head so I was hoping the geniuses and trolls of /r/stocks could help me out.\n\nSo here is a summary of the news:\n\n* PATRIOT ONE TECHNOLOGIES ( PTOTF ) - \u200dENTERED AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH UNDERWRITERS AGREED TO BUY, ON BOUGHT DEAL BASIS, 8.7 MILLION UNITS AT $2.00 PER UNIT.\n\nMind you, the company has a market cap of only 157M and the current price is $1.77 so this is a huge deal for the company.\n\nShortly after this was announced, The Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) put a halt on exchanging $PTOTF shares. \n\nIt was subsequently resumed after they announced an \"Increase to the Previously Announced Bought Deal Financing\". It is stated that the original deal of 8.7M is now going to be worth 22M.\n\nNOW. This is where it gets confusing as f*** for me.\n\n\"Each Unit will consist of one common share of the Company (a \"Common Share\") and one half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole Common Share purchase warrant, a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will be exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a \"Warrant Share\") for a period of 36 months following the closing of the Offering (the \"Closing\") at an exercise price of $2.40 per Warrant Share.\"\n\nSo is this saying that they are also being given an call option of $2.40??? \nOkay, they are anticipating the share which is currently trading at $1.77 to go up to $2.40. That's good, right??\n\nAnd then there is this:\nThe Company has agreed to grant the Underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,650,000 Units at the Offering Price or up to 825,000 Warrants at a price of $0.30 per Warrant, exercisable in whole or in part, at any time on or prior to the date that is 30 days following the Closing.\n\nSo this means that if they want, they can buy an additional 825,000 call options for $.30 per option. Correct?\n\nSo all is fine and dandy in the world of PTOTF you would think. They just got a massive investment, they have a bunch of units on back order, their product is now saleable in 66 countries, and they've also said they have 13 huge contracts in the works, and a bunch of smaller ones.\n\nOkay. So, why did PTOTF poop the bed and drop by 8% percent today? I actually doubled down on my position during the dip. But I'm getting a little worried here that there is something I'm missing in these announcements that has everyone else pulling out.\nCould the price drop simple be due to the fact that the IIROC put a halt on exchanging PTOTF? \n\nThank you all for your thoughts and efforts.\n\nHere are links to the actual material:\n\nPatriot One Announces an Increase to the Previously Announced Bought Deal Financing\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/patriot-one-announces-increase-previously-150700849.html?.tsrc=rss\n\nIIROC Trade Halt - Patriot One Technologies Inc.\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/patriot-one-announces-increase-previously-150700849.html?.tsrc=rss\n\nPatriot One Announces $17.4 Million Bought Deal\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/patriot-one-announces-17-4-123100735.html?.tsrc=rss\n\n", "parent_text": "Could you maybe go a little more in depth on this?

A whole bunch of people will tell you about time decay and all that (which really only a problem if market stays flat), but keep in mind that a big 2008-like event could wipe out 80% of leveraged ETF's value. Then again I do not believe such a huge recession will happen in the next decade, so take it for what it's worth.\n\nAlso, there were several researches into leveraged ETFs and it came out that the best leverage to use long term is something like 2.2 (note that leverage = 1, or in other words, index itself, is also leverage, and no, it didn't perform better than 2.2).\n\nMy only comment otherwise is that you're still tech heavy after moving stuff around. From the looks of it, I'd suggest something industrial / materials segment, especially given how fertile the proverbial ground is right now for those industries. I would also suggest some defence stuff. BA seems to be a darling, but you can't go wrong with any of the RTN, NOC, LMT, BA group. If anything, the former three have a better shot at not experiencing a large scale pullback anytime soon. Or, since you're fan of leveraged ETFs, check out DFEN.

That is, I see no guarantee of long term survival for the company. Now I do believe, and have believed for some time, that oil prices are heading north, and that appears to be playing out. However, natural gas is most of CHK's business, not oil, and prices remain far down in the toilet and I can't see any near term relief for that. \n\nIf and when the commodity prices do turn upward, nothing skyrockets quite so fast as the share price of a downtrodden E&P company. Most E&Ps have already rebounded off of last year's lows, but CHK remains down there at the bottom. So that scenario could happen, CHK as a \"catch up\" play on an energy market turnaround.\n\nBut risky. The company is in very poor financial shape. I question how long they can remain a going concern in the absence of an industry wide turnaround. I have my share of risky E&Ps in my portfolio to play on this same oil market turnaround which I expect, but I deemed CHK too risky for that. The others I am in can survive a few more years of low oil/gas prices, but I question if CHK can.\n\nI think a better and safer play on the eventual recovery (whenever it is) of natural gas prices is UNG (US Natural Gas Fund), which is currently cheap, cheap, cheap, but will someday, inevitably, produce exponential gains from this point. But it could take years, could get worse before it gets better, and be \"dead money\" for a long period while one is waiting for that to happen. But it will happen. Eventually. My question is if CHK will still be around to enjoy that turnaround in the market. The worst risks are the risks you don't know about, and CHK, like all companies, no doubt has some in that category.
