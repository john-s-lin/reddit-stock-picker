After studying book summaries of The Intelligent Investor, the Little Book of Common Sense Investing, and a couple others; here is my advice to you. \n\nFirstly, markets have cycles. You and I have both been blessed to experience this downturn at the beginning of our journey, because it presents a buying opportunity. One thing is for sure, you definitely should not be selling. Instead you should be slowly averaging your money into the market. \n\nYou mention that your gains will be wiped for 1-2 years. Who cares about 1-2 years down the line? This is a 10-15 year game (30 years for me).. so just keep buying and after some years you\u2019ll be thankful for the low prices you took advantage of. \n\nThere\u2019s no way you can time the market. Don\u2019t join the rest of the fools trying to cash out and back in, because it\u2019s truly impossible to predict the bottom. Just understand that in the long term, the U.S. will continue to raise its productivity and companies will appreciate in value. This is a small blip in your journey.

Especially if you are data oriented.  Some of my favorites I list here.  [https://www.kennie.org/recommended-reading/finance-books/](https://www.kennie.org/recommended-reading/finance-books/)\n\nTop reads are probably How a 2nd Grader beat wall street, the coffee house investor, and anything by Jane Bryant Quinn.  \n\nI dabbled in stocks a bit, but after reading these books I realized how easy investing can be, compared to speculation.  Another awesome book is the one on Neuro Economics.  Your Money and Your Brain.... title from the list.  By Jason Zweig.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also recommend delving into the investopedia on \"index funds\".  You could also try looking around the Bogleheads wikipedia and forums.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot to know about individual stocks and I wish I could go back and give myself the advice to not buy individual stocks.  There are so many land mines there.  For example a company can declare the stock \"null and void\".  Also, if the company tanks, you are left with thousands of shares of worthless stock that show up in your account even though you cannot sell the.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also recommend learning the difference between \"investing\" and \"speculating/trading\".  \n\nIMHO there are two things you can control.  1.  How much you invest and 2.  How much it is costing you to invest.  Everything else is VERY variable.  \n\n1. Should be as much as you can easily afford.  \n2. Should be as low as possible.  All of my E/R's are <0.10%.   Compared to some peoples 2.0-5.0%.  Over 20 years compound interest will make a big difference. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck in your adventures into investing!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 64, "submission_ratio": 0.03125, "submission_title": "Started investing in October... what an education.

Another awesome book is the one on Neuro Economics.  Your Money and Your Brain.... title from the list.

How much you invest and 2.  How much it is costing you to invest.  Everything else is VERY variable.  \n\n1. Should be as much as you can easily afford.  \n2. Should be as low as possible.  All of my E/R's are <0.10%.   Compared to some peoples 2.0-5.0%.
