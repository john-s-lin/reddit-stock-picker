Would you walk away from $19M as a random executive who isn't a bajillionaire? NO. \n\nI wonder if it is too low to short. If there is a buyout (I don't think there will be), things could soar. But I think the opposite is likely. \n\nChecking traffic to their website, #s dropped PRECIPITOUSLY from July into September, October, and November. December saw good traffic but it only returned to July levels (should've been stupendous if it were to offset SON). This is not a direct correlation to daily or monthly users but it is hardly a bad guesstimation. \n\nThis, IMO, means that even if their financials are somewhat improved, their USERBASE is now cratering, which is much more key, and probably explains why this executive was happy taking a 95% write-down on his potential SNAP earnings. Does that mean the stock is worth 5% of current valuation? POSSIBLY! But I would look for a cratering user count in the earnings report which could offset any \"positive\" financial news (which would still be blowing through cash even if they are improving). \n\nPS: apparently Miranda Kerr is off the Evan Spiegel train.

I would look into companies that specialize in water conservation for instance for agriculture in the Imperial country ( I think) in California and on technological remedies such as cloud seeding and desalinization. Aquifers and wells are becoming more and more depleted as witnessed by the ever deeper well drilling by almond farmers in California.

Don't buy single stocks or derivatives like options, you can do that down the road once you are more knowledgeable and have more capital to invest. I have included a link to different \"lazy portfolios\" below. \n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios\n\nStep 4- Keep investing small amounts regularly; avoid college loan debt. Get a good job, eliminate all other debt, have a high savings rate, and take advantage of tax advantaged accounts (IRA, 401K, HSA, etc.). Rebalance portfolios annually to make sure that you are at your desired asset allocations.

After finally picking it up, I now enjoy day trading as a side hobby while also investing the majority of my money in long term safer, low cost, index funds. \n\nMy understanding based on years of research and experience is that  long term investing in low cost etfs / index funds is one of the safest plays you can make if you want exposure to the market. Expert investor warren buffet also supports this. \n\nSince you\u2019re so young and have a very long time horizon, I\u2019d recommend light day trading to gain experience. You\u2019re likely going to make a ton more money in your lifetime so can afford to be a little more bold now. I\u2019m not certain if this is accurate for your specific situation though. \n\nBottom line day trading is very risky but can also have big rewards. You\u2019re never going to get it right all the time but the trick is to choose right more than you choose wrong. If you stick with it, learn as much as you can, and be careful, you should be able to make money day trading over time. \n\nAlternatively my understanding is the safest bet you can make if you\u2019re only interested in long term growth are to use low cost index funds to park the money, forget about it, and let it grow over time. \n\nTo learn more about day trading and investing in general I\u2019d recommend watching all the on demand videos and attending all the free webinars tdameritrade offers to its customers. Also watch the various stock channels in your spare time and read as much as you can. \n\nPersonally I focus on the s&p 500 only. It took me a long time but I set up watch lists that were broken down by each sector, researched every company, then made a combined core watchlist of companies I liked based on all that research. Then it\u2019s much easier to manage a list of core favorite companies and use automated alerts to notify you or take action when various things of interest happen. \n\nI personally have made the most money focusing on the technology sector over the years followed by finance and then health / bio companies. \n\nHopefully this helps and good luck!", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 10, "submission_ratio": 0.3, "submission_title": "18 y/o my dad helped me set up a TDAmeritrade account, I only have $1000 in it now.

After finally picking it up, I now enjoy day trading as a side hobby while also investing the majority of my money in long term safer, low cost, index funds. \n\nMy understanding based on years of research and experience is that  long term investing in low cost etfs / index funds is one of the safest plays you can make if you want exposure to the market. Expert investor warren buffet also supports this. \n\nSince you\u2019re so young and have a very long time horizon, I\u2019d recommend light day trading to gain experience. You\u2019re likely going to make a ton more money in your lifetime so can afford to be a little more bold now. I\u2019m not certain if this is accurate for your specific situation though. \n\nBottom line day trading is very risky but can also have big rewards. You\u2019re never going to get it right all the time but the trick is to choose right more than you choose wrong. If you stick with it, learn as much as you can, and be careful, you should be able to make money day trading over time. \n\nAlternatively my understanding is the safest bet you can make if you\u2019re only interested in long term growth are to use low cost index funds to park the money, forget about it, and let it grow over time. \n\nTo learn more about day trading and investing in general I\u2019d recommend watching all the on demand videos and attending all the free webinars tdameritrade offers to its customers. Also watch the various stock channels in your spare time and read as much as you can. \n\nPersonally I focus on the s&p 500 only. It took me a long time but I set up watch lists that were broken down by each sector, researched every company, then made a combined core watchlist of companies I liked based on all that research. Then it\u2019s much easier to manage a list of core favorite companies and use automated alerts to notify you or take action when various things of interest happen. \n\nI personally have made the most money focusing on the technology sector over the years followed by finance and then health / bio companies. \n\nHopefully this helps and good luck!", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 0.6666666666666666}, {"time": 1547573035.0, "submission_id": "ag92kv", "comment_id": "ee4s3su", "body": "being 18yo with $1,000 is no time to play it safe.

What if this time, it jumps to $375 or $400?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I said if you focus on 10 years, TSLA will grow long term. Think TSLA as Ford or GM during their start up years. TSLA is EV innovation, and they survive appx 25 years. Elon is aggressive keeping TSLA like AMZN or NFLX, keep on making capital investments, mass production technology that no other competitors are able to match quality and price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are expanding to China as that is second best place to sell cars . Economy is slowing, but TSLA needs one or two years to go full production. Auto-pilot, 100 KW charger network, Giga-factory are massive infrastructure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 10 years, you will see majority EV cars on the road, as cost effective option. Being leader in technology, they survive long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought (and sold) many times at $41, $128, $250, $296...etc, finally holding my $296 purchase. The money I invested in TSLA is just profit I made from TSLA buy/sell (many times).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing retirement account (not taxed) Year 2017, I made $37000 from TSLA and Year 2018 I made $31333.80, now I am holding just 300 shares of TSLA($296). Even if it comes to $1/share, that is my profit now.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CSEHK4W.png](https://i.imgur.com/CSEHK4W.png).
