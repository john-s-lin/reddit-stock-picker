As an example, SPYV and SPYG are some often-commission-free ETFs that cover a good variety of quality stocks with much lower expense ratios than you\u2019d get at Edward Jones. Being commission free, you can also throw $30 at a time at them when it\u2019s free. \n\nThe biggest advantage of somebody else managing your investments is avoiding panic selling. If you can trust yourself to not touch the assets and just let them grow, consider doing your own thing with broad ETFs. \n\n(This is all my opinion.

The first thing to consider is to make sure you\u2019re looking at the right figures and in the right places. The market performed incredible in 2017 so you shouldn\u2019t be down unless your portfolio was extremely mishandled. Being down this year is certainly possible as we had some rough weeks but 10% is still pretty harsh. I would make sure you are definitely looking at the right figures and understanding them before jumping to any conclusions. If you do all that and you\u2019re still at the same conclusion, then something is very wrong here.\n\nSecond, financial advisors can be beneficial for some people and completely useless to others. Truth of the matter is that anyone, with some time and effort, can learn how invest their money into low cost, diverse, and sound holdings by themselves. It may be intimidating and confusing at first, but if you dedicate some time to research and learn things it\u2019s absolutely possible. Something to consider if you think you\u2019d like to take more control of your portfolio and reduce costs. Other people simply don\u2019t want to take the time to learn this stuff or would rather someone else do it for them. Nothing wrong with this choice either but you\u2019ll have to pay a premium for having something do this stuff for you. Financial advisors can also be helpful for people with complex or very large portfolios but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s your case (at least not right now anyways!).\n\nEdward Jones kind of has a crappy reputation when it comes to fees and customer service. Financial advisors can take a considerable chunk of your portfolio each year with their fees as it is, so you want to make your going with one who doesn\u2019t have abnormally high fees and rates. The truth also is that you\u2019re a small fry to them with $4,000. It sucks but they\u2019re not going to give you much time of day with a portfolio of that size. Doesn\u2019t make it right, but it\u2019s often how these companies work. Regardless, if you feel like you\u2019re still being ignored, treated poorly, and charged highly for it while having your portfolio mismanaged then I would look into other brokerages, advisors, and financial platforms.\n\nIf you think you really need a financial advisor to help you with all this stuff then I\u2019d recommend looking at other advisors out there. Make sure you really research them too. Most charge around 1\u20131.5% fees but if you can look for a flat fee advisor who doesn\u2019t charge you a percentage but rather a flat, set amount like say $150 per year or something like that. Percentage based fees take a considerable chunk of your portfolio and returns so if you can learn this stuff yourself successfully you\u2019ll save a lot in the long run. Don\u2019t let such a small number make you think it doesn\u2019t matter much either, as these fees add up fast as your portfolio grows and the more time you spend in the market. For example, an advisor charging 1.5% looking over a portfolio of one million dollars for some 55 year old is getting 15k per year in fees! With inflation often being 2-3% and then potentially having to pay taxes if you sell any of your holdings, these advisor fees will only take more away of your returns. Another thing to note that these financial advisor fees still happen regardless of how your portfolio is performing.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a lot of these financial advisors out there simply put your money into funds that you could do yourself and for far cheaper. These are often sound funds that are well diverse and track stuff like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. To make matters worse, it seems like your advisor can\u2019t even do this part right.\n\nSo what do I recommend? I\u2019d take a moment to sit down and truly ask yourself if you think you\u2019re realistically capable and willing to learn how to do this stuff yourself. Like I said earlier, it takes time and effort but it\u2019s really not super hard once you learn the basic principles of things. You also have to ask yourself if you have enough of a stomach to be able to sit tight when the eventual market corrections or crash occur. Will you panic and sell at a loss once the market experiences a correction or crash if you now have full control of your portfolio? Or will you stay calm and collected by sitting tight and realizing that if history has taught us anything, the market should return back to normal and then some as long as the US is still standing and the wheels still turning.\n\nIf you think you can learn this stuff yourself and keep calm when a dip or crash occurs (and they will occur) then I\u2019d recommend closing your account and ending your relationship with your financial advisor. Call up any of the big brokerages like Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, and Charles Schwab to name a few and open an account with them. I always recommend Vanguard personally but they all have their pros and cons. I\u2019d also recommend opening a ROTH IRA with these brokerages and contributing the max of $5,500 per year into your ROTH IRA. I think one of Vanguard\u2019s Target Retirement Funds held within your ROTH IRA may be very attractive and helpful in your situation. These funds almost act like they\u2019re being controlled by a financial advisor without all the high fees associated with them.\n\nTalk with a representative from your new broker and see if you can simply initiate a movement of funds from Edward Jones into your new broker\u2019s account, preferably into the new ROTH IRA you should have just opened with them. Make sure once the funds are moved that close your Edward Jones account and have terminated your business relationship with your financial advisor. Get this in writing! You don\u2019t want them trying to still charge you fees by keeping your account open, automatically renewing your plan with your advisor, or anything else shady.\n\nAfter doing all that, sit tight, keep contributing until you hit that $5,500 yearly limit, don\u2019t panic withdraw if a correction occurs, and keep on reading and learning as much as you can digest. Once you get a little more comfortable with things, you can start to explore more stuff like taking advantage of other tax advantaged accounts, investing in certain sectors or individual companies, and such. But for now, definitely take care of that ROTH IRA with your new broker. Again, keep reading and don\u2019t be afraid to call up your new broker for some help or advice. The support staff at the brokers I mentioned are all often very well regarded, kind, and helpful.\n\nIf you feel you still absolutely need a financial advisor, then I\u2019d still recommend switching to a new one. I don\u2019t use financial advisors personally so I can\u2019t recommend any good ones myself but the one you have right now isn\u2019t performing well and clearly doesn\u2019t value your business very much. Don\u2019t let them not do their job, treat you poorly, and still profit. Remember, it doesn\u2019t work like that unless you allow it and it\u2019s your money not theirs.", "score": 11, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 139, "submission_ratio": 0.07913669064748201, "submission_title": "Concerned about my financial advisor", "submission_text": "Hi.

I feel like I\u2019m not a priority for her because I\u2019m young and broke and have oodles of college debt. Should I get out of there or what?", "parent_text": "Couple things here. The first thing to consider is to make sure you\u2019re looking at the right figures and in the right places. The market performed incredible in 2017 so you shouldn\u2019t be down unless your portfolio was extremely mishandled. Being down this year is certainly possible as we had some rough weeks but 10% is still pretty harsh. I would make sure you are definitely looking at the right figures and understanding them before jumping to any conclusions. If you do all that and you\u2019re still at the same conclusion, then something is very wrong here.\n\nSecond, financial advisors can be beneficial for some people and completely useless to others. Truth of the matter is that anyone, with some time and effort, can learn how invest their money into low cost, diverse, and sound holdings by themselves. It may be intimidating and confusing at first, but if you dedicate some time to research and learn things it\u2019s absolutely possible. Something to consider if you think you\u2019d like to take more control of your portfolio and reduce costs. Other people simply don\u2019t want to take the time to learn this stuff or would rather someone else do it for them. Nothing wrong with this choice either but you\u2019ll have to pay a premium for having something do this stuff for you. Financial advisors can also be helpful for people with complex or very large portfolios but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s your case (at least not right now anyways!).\n\nEdward Jones kind of has a crappy reputation when it comes to fees and customer service. Financial advisors can take a considerable chunk of your portfolio each year with their fees as it is, so you want to make your going with one who doesn\u2019t have abnormally high fees and rates. The truth also is that you\u2019re a small fry to them with $4,000. It sucks but they\u2019re not going to give you much time of day with a portfolio of that size. Doesn\u2019t make it right, but it\u2019s often how these companies work. Regardless, if you feel like you\u2019re still being ignored, treated poorly, and charged highly for it while having your portfolio mismanaged then I would look into other brokerages, advisors, and financial platforms.\n\nIf you think you really need a financial advisor to help you with all this stuff then I\u2019d recommend looking at other advisors out there. Make sure you really research them too. Most charge around 1\u20131.5% fees but if you can look for a flat fee advisor who doesn\u2019t charge you a percentage but rather a flat, set amount like say $150 per year or something like that. Percentage based fees take a considerable chunk of your portfolio and returns so if you can learn this stuff yourself successfully you\u2019ll save a lot in the long run. Don\u2019t let such a small number make you think it doesn\u2019t matter much either, as these fees add up fast as your portfolio grows and the more time you spend in the market. For example, an advisor charging 1.5% looking over a portfolio of one million dollars for some 55 year old is getting 15k per year in fees! With inflation often being 2-3% and then potentially having to pay taxes if you sell any of your holdings, these advisor fees will only take more away of your returns. Another thing to note that these financial advisor fees still happen regardless of how your portfolio is performing.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a lot of these financial advisors out there simply put your money into funds that you could do yourself and for far cheaper. These are often sound funds that are well diverse and track stuff like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. To make matters worse, it seems like your advisor can\u2019t even do this part right.\n\nSo what do I recommend? I\u2019d take a moment to sit down and truly ask yourself if you think you\u2019re realistically capable and willing to learn how to do this stuff yourself. Like I said earlier, it takes time and effort but it\u2019s really not super hard once you learn the basic principles of things. You also have to ask yourself if you have enough of a stomach to be able to sit tight when the eventual market corrections or crash occur. Will you panic and sell at a loss once the market experiences a correction or crash if you now have full control of your portfolio? Or will you stay calm and collected by sitting tight and realizing that if history has taught us anything, the market should return back to normal and then some as long as the US is still standing and the wheels still turning.\n\nIf you think you can learn this stuff yourself and keep calm when a dip or crash occurs (and they will occur) then I\u2019d recommend closing your account and ending your relationship with your financial advisor. Call up any of the big brokerages like Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, and Charles Schwab to name a few and open an account with them. I always recommend Vanguard personally but they all have their pros and cons. I\u2019d also recommend opening a ROTH IRA with these brokerages and contributing the max of $5,500 per year into your ROTH IRA. I think one of Vanguard\u2019s Target Retirement Funds held within your ROTH IRA may be very attractive and helpful in your situation. These funds almost act like they\u2019re being controlled by a financial advisor without all the high fees associated with them.\n\nTalk with a representative from your new broker and see if you can simply initiate a movement of funds from Edward Jones into your new broker\u2019s account, preferably into the new ROTH IRA you should have just opened with them. Make sure once the funds are moved that close your Edward Jones account and have terminated your business relationship with your financial advisor. Get this in writing! You don\u2019t want them trying to still charge you fees by keeping your account open, automatically renewing your plan with your advisor, or anything else shady.\n\nAfter doing all that, sit tight, keep contributing until you hit that $5,500 yearly limit, don\u2019t panic withdraw if a correction occurs, and keep on reading and learning as much as you can digest. Once you get a little more comfortable with things, you can start to explore more stuff like taking advantage of other tax advantaged accounts, investing in certain sectors or individual companies, and such. But for now, definitely take care of that ROTH IRA with your new broker. Again, keep reading and don\u2019t be afraid to call up your new broker for some help or advice. The support staff at the brokers I mentioned are all often very well regarded, kind, and helpful.\n\nIf you feel you still absolutely need a financial advisor, then I\u2019d still recommend switching to a new one. I don\u2019t use financial advisors personally so I can\u2019t recommend any good ones myself but the one you have right now isn\u2019t performing well and clearly doesn\u2019t value your business very much. Don\u2019t let them not do their job, treat you poorly, and still profit. Remember, it doesn\u2019t work like that unless you allow it and it\u2019s your money not theirs.", "parent_score": 11, "parent_ratio": 0.2727272727272727}, {"time": 1524328840.0, "submission_id": "8dv9vi", "comment_id": "dxqkjcj", "body": "Make sure you fill out the public service loan forgiveness form and setup some form of income based repayment.

I\u2019m most interested in seeing how Facebook, Texas Instrumentals, and Exxon have performed and what they have to say. \n\nI got in on Facebook a few weeks ago after the dip and all the controversy. Curious to see how the market reacts to their release, regardless if it\u2019s good or bad. I\u2019m suspecting they\u2019ll have some really solid numbers during this release and will really blow people out of the water with not only their numbers but their statements as well.\n\nExxon I\u2019m really interested in because I think oil is going to have a decent run. It\u2019s been a pretty beat up sector the past few years but I do think they\u2019re finally due for a turn around. How long this turn around will last I can\u2019t say but I do think it\u2019s happening. I put about 8% of my portfolio into oil about 6 months and it has paid off moderately thus far.\n\nTexas instrumentals is a company (along with Ulta) that I\u2019ve had my eyes on for a few weeks now. Think they\u2019re both solid companies but I\u2019ve yet to pull the trigger on either of them. Part of this have been because of a current lack of funds but I\u2019m also waiting for a fair price to jump into. I\u2019d like to see T.I. go a bit lower (they\u2019re still up from a year ago) but I think they\u2019re relatively fairly priced at the moment after dipping roughly 12-13% from the start of 2018. Ulta is looking pretty attractive right now as it\u2019s down roughly 15% from a year ago.\n\nWe have some other big top dogs this week as well. I think whether they meet or exceed expectations will have a lot to do with how the market in general performs over the next couple weeks. Good or great news may keep investor confidence high and keep the wheels in this bull run turning. Tech could especially use some good news and consistency right now. The tough thing is that investors and watchers have some really high standards right now in this bull market so meeting expectations often isn\u2019t t enough.\n\nOnly time will tell but I can\u2019t wait to see how this week unfolds.", "score": 7, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 52, "submission_ratio": 0.1346153846153846, "submission_title": "Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the week beginning April 23rd, 2018", "submission_text": "Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$AMZN** \n> * **$FB** \n> * **$AMD** \n> * **$MSFT** \n> * **$BA** \n> * **$TWTR** \n> * **$GOOGL** \n> * **$INTC** \n> * **$CAT** \n> * **$HAL** \n> * **$X** \n> * **$V** \n> * **$LMT** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$ALK** \n> * **$XOM** \n> * **$ABBV** \n> * **$F** \n> * **$MMM** \n> * **$AMTD** \n> * **$VZ** \n> * **$T** \n> * **$FCX** \n> * **$WYNN** \n> * **$KMB** \n> * **$UPS** \n> * **$HAS** \n> * **$KO** \n> * **$CMCSA** \n> * **$RTN** \n> * **$AAL** \n> * **$WDC** \n> * **$BIIB** \n> * **$STM** \n> * **$QCOM** \n> * **$TXN** \n> * **$SBUX** \n> * **$GM** \n> * **$ALGN** \n> * **$LUV** \n> * **$UTX** \n> * **$NOK** \n> * **$CMG** \n> * **$CVX** \n> * **$SIRI**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5lOwu4T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cGVzJ9E.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the most notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming week ahead which includes the time of release & estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers.\n\n*****\n\n# **Monday 4.23.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8mo2jiO.png))\n\n# **Monday 4.23.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/utnXlg7.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Tuesday 4.24.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aUL7eVf.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dSlEF8R.png))\n\n# **Tuesday 4.24.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/t2ALz8d.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Wednesday 4.25.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NHF30OH.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/jqfuGhB.png))\n\n# **Wednesday 4.25.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/yZvMUEM.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/tMKjafA.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Thursday 4.26.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2E1nqNX.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/b5ZNNQa.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/BRXEa2w.png))\n\n# **Thursday 4.26.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NLTBCpb.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ut1HsT7.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 4.27.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vAUVmNg.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 4.27.18 After Market Close:**\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qZOW528.png))\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. - \n> **Amazon.com, Inc.
