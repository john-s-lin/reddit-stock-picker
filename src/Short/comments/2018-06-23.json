There's nothing wrong with them, the fees are just a tad cheaper if you put together the mixture of index funds yourself, and re-balance occasionally (buy and/or sell to make it a certain ratio, you can just copy vanguard's recommendation that they use for their own target funds, they show it right in your user profile with a pie chart). I'm 27 and Vanguard's recommendation is 90% stocks, 10% bonds. It basically stays like that until 40, where it gradually adds bonds every 5 years.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with them, but you can save a little bit of money over the long run if you just buy the mutual funds/etfs that make up the target funds yourself and re-balance like once or twice a year. \n\nTo illustrate, 90% of a target date fund if you're under 40 is like 54% domestic index and 36% international index. (other 10% is like 7% domestic bond index, 3% international bond index)\n\nSo 54% of the target date fund is the same as VTSAX which has an expense ratio of 0.04% vs the 0.13% target date fund\n https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vtsax\n\n36% of the target date fund is the same as VTIAX, which has a 0.11% expense ratio vs. 0.13%\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vtiax\n\nNote that until you hit 10k in each of those funds, you will have to buy the lower-grade \"investor shares\" that are the same thing, but the fees are roughly the same as the target date. You can upgrade to \"admiral shares\" with the cheap expense ratio once you hit 10k. It won't really matter though, the fees are negligible if you're under 10k. Alternatively, you can get the ETF right now (price of one share) for the same expense ratio as the Admiral Shares, but ETFs are slightly trickier to purchase, though you get a little more freedom. They sell throughout the day at an ever-changing price vs. one price at the end of the day for mutual funds. Also, you buy in whole shares rather than dollar amounts like Mutual Funds, so you might have some odd dollars left that are under the share price after buying a certain planned amount.\n\nTLDR; they're not bad at all, you can just save a little bit on expense ratios with a little DIY.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 19, "submission_ratio": 0.05263157894736842, "submission_title": "New to IRAs, about to choose a target retirement fund.

There's nothing wrong with them, the fees are just a tad cheaper if you put together the mixture of index funds yourself, and re-balance occasionally (buy and/or sell to make it a certain ratio, you can just copy vanguard's recommendation that they use for their own target funds, they show it right in your user profile with a pie chart). I'm 27 and Vanguard's recommendation is 90% stocks, 10% bonds. It basically stays like that until 40, where it gradually adds bonds every 5 years.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with them, but you can save a little bit of money over the long run if you just buy the mutual funds/etfs that make up the target funds yourself and re-balance like once or twice a year. \n\nTo illustrate, 90% of a target date fund if you're under 40 is like 54% domestic index and 36% international index. (other 10% is like 7% domestic bond index, 3% international bond index)\n\nSo 54% of the target date fund is the same as VTSAX which has an expense ratio of 0.04% vs the 0.13% target date fund\n https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vtsax\n\n36% of the target date fund is the same as VTIAX, which has a 0.11% expense ratio vs. 0.13%\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vtiax\n\nNote that until you hit 10k in each of those funds, you will have to buy the lower-grade \"investor shares\" that are the same thing, but the fees are roughly the same as the target date. You can upgrade to \"admiral shares\" with the cheap expense ratio once you hit 10k. It won't really matter though, the fees are negligible if you're under 10k. Alternatively, you can get the ETF right now (price of one share) for the same expense ratio as the Admiral Shares, but ETFs are slightly trickier to purchase, though you get a little more freedom. They sell throughout the day at an ever-changing price vs. one price at the end of the day for mutual funds. Also, you buy in whole shares rather than dollar amounts like Mutual Funds, so you might have some odd dollars left that are under the share price after buying a certain planned amount.\n\nTLDR; they're not bad at all, you can just save a little bit on expense ratios with a little DIY.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 2.0}, {"time": 1529870686.0, "submission_id": "8tf14h", "comment_id": "e185pn2", "body": "Haha thanks very much cat person :)", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 19, "submission_ratio": 0.05263157894736842, "submission_title": "New to IRAs, about to choose a target retirement fund.
