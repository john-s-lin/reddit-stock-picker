I saved this all through a job that I quit from recently so need to get another one.\n\nI know all the basics from stock types, buy options, charting and so on.

I have also looked into options such as Acorns and M1 Finance, which some people live by and some people warn others of.\n\nSo I know the basics and don't have the capital.

I saved this all through a job that I quit from recently so need to get another one.\n\nI know all the basics from stock types, buy options, charting and so on. The course also went through different types of brokers. I got started with Rhood (can't name entire app), but I feel that I don't have the capital needed to make the proper investments.\n\nI would love mutual funds like Vanguard but those have a $10,000 minimum or at the least $3000. So I am looking at cheaper options such as Wealthfront and Betterment to get started (leaning towards Wealthfront even though minimum of $500). I have also looked into options such as Acorns and M1 Finance, which some people live by and some people warn others of.\n\nSo I know the basics and don't have the capital.

Canadian solar's market cap is 750mil so im not sure where the 5 billion figure comes from, first solar is 5.5bil however. From these it looks kinda like Canadian solar is undervalued, its income statement looks better with rising revenues and a more consistently positive net income. However most every other metric favors First Solar which is probably why it is valued as such. Its balance sheet looks better, much less debt, as well as far better cash flow. Canadian solar has a lot more invested in capital expenditures as well as more net borrowing. \n\nI would really need to invest time in this sector to make a informed suggest. Im just throwing out the basics on how I get started about doing this. Reading their earnings call transcripts can be very revealing of what the major institutions are concerned about. All of this is for just 2 companies, now expand that to 5 or 6 and you have some homework.\n\nA tendency you seem to have which is ill-fated is looking at how much a company has fallen as an indicator of value. There is nothing great about a higher loss in value, in fact those are the companies most likely to be losing the battle.\n\n For example Convata has a 5% dividend sure, but why? Why is what matters. They havent increased their dividend since 2014. They stopped because they have been doing worse. Cash flow is decreasing, cost of revenue is rising, while actual revenue is flat. Their stock is down over 40% since their last dividend increase, so a 5% dividend was never the intention. The high dividend in direct relation to its decreased share price. If the company continues down its path it will have to cut divideneds, and even so what was a 3% dividend that went up to 5% because the stock is down 40%, is not a good investment.\n\n", "score": 5, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 9, "submission_ratio": 0.5555555555555556, "submission_title": "My Clean Energy play", "submission_text": "I have been trying to research this for a few hours.

Canadian solar's market cap is 750mil so im not sure where the 5 billion figure comes from, first solar is 5.5bil however. From these it looks kinda like Canadian solar is undervalued, its income statement looks better with rising revenues and a more consistently positive net income. However most every other metric favors First Solar which is probably why it is valued as such. Its balance sheet looks better, much less debt, as well as far better cash flow. Canadian solar has a lot more invested in capital expenditures as well as more net borrowing. \n\nI would really need to invest time in this sector to make a informed suggest. Im just throwing out the basics on how I get started about doing this. Reading their earnings call transcripts can be very revealing of what the major institutions are concerned about. All of this is for just 2 companies, now expand that to 5 or 6 and you have some homework.\n\nA tendency you seem to have which is ill-fated is looking at how much a company has fallen as an indicator of value. There is nothing great about a higher loss in value, in fact those are the companies most likely to be losing the battle.\n\n For example Convata has a 5% dividend sure, but why? Why is what matters. They havent increased their dividend since 2014. They stopped because they have been doing worse. Cash flow is decreasing, cost of revenue is rising, while actual revenue is flat. Their stock is down over 40% since their last dividend increase, so a 5% dividend was never the intention. The high dividend in direct relation to its decreased share price. If the company continues down its path it will have to cut divideneds, and even so what was a 3% dividend that went up to 5% because the stock is down 40%, is not a good investment.\n\n", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.2}, {"time": 1534917963.0, "submission_id": "99ajgv", "comment_id": "e4m9cki", "body": "Check out AQN and NEP as well.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 9, "submission_ratio": 0.3333333333333333, "submission_title": "My Clean Energy play", "submission_text": "I have been trying to research this for a few hours.
