I still don't think an EV would be on my shopping list.\n\n\nTherein lies the problem for Tesla and its stock. They have a 6 to 7 year head start over the rest of the industry. By now they should have been at a place where they had a massive lead over their would be competitors. But they do not. Already Jaguar has released an EV. The likes of Audi and the rest of them are not that far behind. Most of these companies have more experience selling cars than Tesla.

I still don't think an EV would be on my shopping list.\n\n\nTherein lies the problem for Tesla and its stock. They have a 6 to 7 year head start over the rest of the industry. By now they should have been at a place where they had a massive lead over their would be competitors. But they do not. Already Jaguar has released an EV. The likes of Audi and the rest of them are not that far behind. Most of these companies have more experience selling cars than Tesla.
