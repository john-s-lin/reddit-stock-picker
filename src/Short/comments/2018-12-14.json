And the iPhone X wasn't the first phone to come out with the notch design - it was the Sharp Aquos S2. So rather than every android being a \"shitty imitation of an iPhone X\", the iPhone X is the true imitation.\n\nNext, I'll analyse all the Apple products. There are many android products with innovative and useful features, such as an screen on both sides (Nubia X), headphone jack (all Samsung galaxy phones), and great specs for a cheap price (pocophone f1). Not to mention all those products I've mentioned are cheaper than the iPhone Xs.\n\nNext, for desktops, the iMac is terribly late in terms of performance. The screen may be nice, but they're using 7th gen Intel processors while they're on their 9th gen already. This means that for enthusiasts, iMacs are not a great choice. For the everyday user, the price of iMacs is just too high to attract many customers.\n\nFor laptops, Apple's controversial butterfly keyboard (which I personally enjoy) is enough to lose customers, and with the high price and thermal throttling on the Pro line, the Macbook Pro is not a good buy. The Macbook air is already outperformed and is heavier than other premium laptops such as the HP Spectre and adding a few tenths of a pound to the weight of the laptop could get a Dell XPS 13 for the same price, which has arguably better build quality, battery life, and much better specs. Finally, the Macbook is in too niche of a market to even be considered as the price is too high for last gen tech.\n\nI'm not trying to say that Apple is a terrible company, but I'm trying to say that if they want to keep their customers, they need to lower prices. There are many alternatives on the market and sure, you have your own opinions, but the rest of the world might not agree so much with you.

It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.

SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.

A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand. Instead, look them over and take advantage of some of the great websites available out there for learning this stuff.
