Crunchyroll and AdultSwim are going to jointly produce and distribute an anime, a move I think will be more common going forward and why the Crunchyroll deal with Funimation (Sony) fell apart. They've dumped content from Boomerang onto VRV, they've signed distribution agreements for old Nickelodeon content for VRV, they're dumping TBS shows like Final Space in there. They're pushing VRV in bundle add-ons with AT&T cell phone plans. Overtime, I think VRV's going to get more Warner content targeted towards kids and teenagers, as well as licensed content from players either unwilling (Viacom) or unable (Hi-Dive) to stand alone in the competitive streaming environment we'll see next year onwards\n\nHBO is being converted into an outright competitor to Netflix and will probably be a dump for all of the Warner content not currently locked up in existing contracts. If Amazon has any of these shows on Amazon Prime, I expect them all to be pulled off of Prime and put onto the new HBO service.\n\nAs for Amazon, I think they're fine with producing their own shows, but I doubt they'll go into the extent Netflix, Disney or AT&T will for theirs simply because they don't need it. They just need to produce one low to mid-budget show per season that is a critical darling, like Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

However due to commissions usually you would need a larger amount of money in your positions to profit. The alternative is free platforms such as Robinhood for commission free trades, the caveat is that it's horrible at providing information you would need to swing trade. Information and analysis is key, imagine swing trading as being lost in the fog of the stock market if you don't have good information. Once you get it, suddenly you're shining a light through that fog. Of course you can attempt swing trading with basic price information & the news, but IMO you'll probably have more failures than successes as the market moves against you. You also need to have a strategy laid out, how you will enter & how you will exit. I personally employ a trailing stop so I don't have to be staring at my investments all the time.\n\nTo get you started off, my 2 favorite indicators are MACD & RSI coupled with 200, 50, & 20 EMAs.

No matter how profitable micro-transactions are, this is something they want to remedy (ideally in a way that sustains profits). I predict they eventually find a happy medium wherein micro transactions exist and are extremely profitable, but they don\u2019t take much away from the gaming experience (and thus sales), and like you said, it would benefit them to get this stuff under control, with age restrictions or something, sooner rather than later before a governing body comes in and outlaws micro-transactions altogether.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 0.0}, {"time": 1544017190.0, "submission_id": "a3bsiz", "comment_id": "eb4ybfu", "body": "i understand.
