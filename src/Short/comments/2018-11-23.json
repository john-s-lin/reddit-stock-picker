It is intranet vs internet.\n\nAs somebody who sells enterprise-grade blockchains (actual decentralized blockchains and not centralized hyperledger databases), I very much disagree with you here. While the opportunity is more niche than the general thinks, it's nowhere niche as you are claiming it is. The thing here is that 99.9% of the population really don't understand how a lot of these industries work, and even if you understand your own, you don't understand others. There are SO many relevant use cases right now that are appropriate for a blockchain, and while a blockchain solution can run you several hundred thousand dollars to implement, it is far cheaper than a lot of SaaS solutions out there that don't fully solve problems.\n\nOne of the best-fit use cases right now is supply chain management and the intricacies that come along with it (RFP management, vendor management, asset tracking, etc.). The technology here is not as robust as people think it is, and most logistics RFP processes heavily remain in excel and severely lack automation. Another use case I can think off of the top of my head is by increasing automation, collaboration, and visibility of assets in the airline industry (assets = seats). The airline industry is generally interconnected through something called a GDS (global distribution system) that coordinates transactions between airlines and regulators for a substantial fee. Airlines are looking at consortium blockchain solutions to disrupt intermediaries like these that are most costly to them than building their own blockchain solution.\n\nBlockchain **will** be the backbone of automation for our future public and enterprise processes, or at least a technology derived from it as blockchains improve. There are private blockchain solutions out there that are necessary for a consortium of companies to collaborate in an agile manner that allows them to only share data with relevant stakeholders, and there is no tech other than blockchain that currently allows this.\n\nNOTE: This is all about blockchain technology, and not crypto. I have no idea if crypto will succeed or tank, it depends on how the tech evolves. But blockchain is more than just the hype that most people claim it is, and the \"hype problem\" exists because most people still don't understand how blockchains work or help.", "score": 19, "num_replies": 4, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 332, "submission_ratio": 0.0572289156626506, "submission_title": "Has Overstock ($OSTK) just committed company suicide?", "submission_text": "They sold off their original business and have invested fully into crypto/blockchain.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.

SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

Some sectors, such as consumer staples or banks, usually have lower P/E ratios while other sectors like Tech often have higher ones. You\u2019ll also want to look at the company itself. A company like say Campbell Soup having a P/E ratio of 40 probably doesn\u2019t make much sense and would be a potentially be a poor entry point as the company is really mature and there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything unique or strong enough to make a case for higher expectations of growth. Meanwhile, a company like Amazon might have a P/E of 100 which can be expected as it\u2019s still a relatively young company and is growing rapidly.\n\nThus, there isn\u2019t really a clear cut, simple answer for your question about what is a good or normal P/E for a company. You have to look at the company itself, compare its P/E to other companies within the same sector, and determine whether the P/E is reasonable. A high P/E isn\u2019t always a bad thing and a low P/E isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing either. It\u2019s all dependent on the situation and company at hand.\n\nOne way you can sort of get an idea of what \u201cnormal\u201d is for a specific sector is to check out sector funds. For example, check out Vanguard\u2019s consumer staples fund and see what the P/E ratio is for the fund as a whole. Then look at some of the companies within the fund and see what their P/E ratios are and see how the company you\u2019re researching compares. Don\u2019t forget to look at historic ratios as well and see how they compare and if you can find any trends.\n\nP/E isn\u2019t the only or most important metric either.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

Some sectors, such as consumer staples or banks, usually have lower P/E ratios while other sectors like Tech often have higher ones. You\u2019ll also want to look at the company itself. A company like say Campbell Soup having a P/E ratio of 40 probably doesn\u2019t make much sense and would be a potentially be a poor entry point as the company is really mature and there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything unique or strong enough to make a case for higher expectations of growth.

A high P/E isn\u2019t always a bad thing and a low P/E isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing either. It\u2019s all dependent on the situation and company at hand.\n\nOne way you can sort of get an idea of what \u201cnormal\u201d is for a specific sector is to check out sector funds. For example, check out Vanguard\u2019s consumer staples fund and see what the P/E ratio is for the fund as a whole. Then look at some of the companies within the fund and see what their P/E ratios are and see how the company you\u2019re researching compares. Don\u2019t forget to look at historic ratios as well and see how they compare and if you can find any trends.\n\nP/E isn\u2019t the only or most important metric either. It should be used along with other formulas and pieces of info when researching a company. While I think it\u2019s important to check, I think people sometimes stress too much about it and overestimate its importance.", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.4}, {"time": 1543022740.0, "submission_id": "9zpz6x", "comment_id": "eac1a6w", "body": "I wholeheartedly agree.

But before you do see the following:\n\n**Important/Basic Terms:**\n\n* **Market Cap** - The total market value of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares.  It can be found by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the price of a single share.  For example, a company with 1,000 outstanding shares each priced at $5 a share would have a market cap of $5,000.  Market cap is extremely important and should be used when valuing/researching a company instead of individual share price.  See here for the difference between [large, small, and micro cap stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/)\n\n* **Shares Outstanding** - The total number of shares held by all shareholders vs [shares float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp) which are shares available to trade.\n\n* **Volume** - Volume is how active a particular company is over a period of time in terms of trading; in other words, the number of shares that are being traded.  Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand.

Typically, you want to look for companies with high volume to [avoid issues with liquidity and other reasons.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060315/stocks-trade-volume-important.asp)  However, if volume is much higher than the average volume in a given period, you may see wilder swings (good or bad) and volatility.\n\n* **Dividend** - A scheduled payout from a company.  Dividends are used to reward investors for investing in a company.  They can be paid monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on a one-time special basis.  Dividends are often issued by mature companies but also companies with limited growth, REITs, and struggling companies trying to attract investors or keep current ones happy.  Dividends can be great, especially for income investors, but it\u2019s important to note that they can limit growth and aren\u2019t tax efficient (you're forced to pay taxes on dividends vs just holding) when held outside a tax advantaged account.  Never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n* **EPS** - The amount of profit allocated to a share of common stock.  This can be found by taking Net Income - Preferred Dividends/Weighted Average of Common Shares.  EPS is very important in determining how successful a company is performing and where it stands in terms of profitability.\n\n* **P/E Ratio** - Stock price divided by EPS.  High P/E typically indicates expectations of high growth.  This is why we see companies like Amazon with relatively high P/E\u2019s.  Low P/E\u2019s may indicate a company is pretty mature and that limited growth is expected.  There are also formulas for trailing P/E and forward P/E.\n\n* **EPS Q/Q** - A way of measuring a company's growth rate by taking this quarter's EPS and comparing it to last years EPS for the same quarter.  EPS Q/Q of 20% tells us that the stock is earning 20% more than last year while factoring in their stock price.\n\n* **PEG** - PEG ratio is used to determine the value of a stock while taking into account growth of a company's earnings.  The formula for PEG ratio is a little more complex than some of the other ones we have here, but [click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp) if you're interested.\n\n* **Sales Q/Q** - Sales is another word for revenue and doesn't factor in stock price like EPS, but is an important metric for growth, especially when a new stock is in the early stages of expansion and probably has a net loss.  A net loss means a stock won't have a P/E or PEG hence sales q/q's importance.\n\n* **Return on Assets (ROA)** - Net Income/Total Assets.  This formula provides a clearer picture of how well a company is managing its assets to generate earnings and ultimately profitability.  Some companies will have low ROA by the nature of their business such as bank stocks.\n\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)** - Net Income/Shareholders Equity.  This formula can be used to get a better idea of future growth, how debt is impacting things, and how the company compares to its peers in the industry.\n\n* **BETA** - The measure of volatility and risk of a company compared to the market as a whole.  A stock with a BETA of 1 means that it will likely act similar and correspond with the market.  A stock with a BETA lower than 1 typically means less volatility is expected while a stock with a BETA higher than 1 means it could potentially more volatile.  These things aren\u2019t set in stone and companies can react and perform quite differently than what their BETA would initially indicate.\n\n* **SMA** - The moving average of a company\u2019s stock price over a specific period of time.  SMA can be used over different periods of time and can help paint a better picture of where a company stands in terms of performance over the past few weeks/months; 50 and 200 days are common periods of time to use with SMA.\n\nEach of these formulas/tools are important and unique in their own way.  However, no single one can be used to successfully invest alone by just itself.  Instead, think of them as only a piece of a big puzzle that make up something bigger.  In addition to knowing what these terms mean, it\u2019s also important to understand why they look the way they do as they can sometimes be misleading without further understanding.  For a example, if dividends are 3 and EPS is a negative number, then a company might need to issue debt to keep up with the dividend payments which is bad for long term growth.\n\n**The importance of quarterly earnings:**\n\nAt the end of every quarter, public companies will make sure everything is more or less up to date and correct; they will have their accounting teams put together things like a balance sheet and income statement for shareholders.  They will often provide a run down of how things went in the most recent quarter and what kind of outlook/guidance they see moving forward.  These run downs are typically under highlights in the earnings release and are always mentioned in the live conference call which investors can listen in.\n\nDon\u2019t be overwhelmed by all the terms here, it\u2019s a lot of info to take in and understand. Instead, look them over and take advantage of some of the great websites available out there for learning this stuff.

They have to decide what to do with the extra money. Some money can go into expansion or research. This can be good because it could mean higher profits in the future. Some money goes into dividends. This is literally splitting up some of the profits and sending it to investors. Some money goes into buybacks. This means buying shares of people who want to sell so that in the future the profits can be split among a smaller group.\n\nIn reality companies that pay the most consistent dividends are companies with a stable profit who have little room for expansion. Companies in rapid expansion generally pay no dividend since they are saving money for research or investments.\n\nThe stock will go down after paying a dividend but that does not mean its meaningless.
