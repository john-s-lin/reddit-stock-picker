(Actually, since the company hasn't officially announced the shutdown, there could still be a sell-off to come, but at their last earnings, they basically came as close to announcing it without explicitly saying it) In other words, this was a bad acquisition for the company and everyone holding MDA stock at the time (double its current price), but not necessarily now depending on what exactly the current price reflects.\n\nOn DGI, I would be *very* surprised if they outright lost the EnhancedView contract given the moat they have in that area.  DGI's satellites are focused on extremely-high resolution imagery with a few big, expensive satellites, while the numerous startups that have recently appeared (including Planet) are focused on lower resolution high-cadence imagery with lots of cheap satellites. That's not to say that some of the stuff the government used to use DGI imagery for is better suited with Planet's imagery, but short of the NRO building and maintaining their own satellites (which they do to an extent, but is expensive), there's no real competition providing DGI's resolution. The biggest risk I see to DGI is if WorldView Legion is significantly delayed or goes way over-budget and derails their capex projections; the stock will probably crater if anything of the sort is suggested at the next few earnings calls.\n\nThe dividend should have little impact on the valuation, and I don't think it really matters if it gets cut or not. They have so much debt, that diverting the dividend to the debt isn't going to make a serious difference as to whether the company succeeds or not in the long run (at least while their cash flow supports it, which is currently true; rising interest rates could change that). I suppose that with a dividend, there's a risk of another sell-off if/when they do cut the dividend, but I'd expect that to be short lived.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous post, a leveraged stock like this behaves like a LEAP call without a defined expiration and should be treated as such---there's a decent chance of value going to zero, but also a decent chance of it increasing by many factors if the company actually does what they say they're going to do.

That\u2019s right, for all you Trekkies out there; I posit that this company will hopefully be the first to design a warp-capable starship.\n\nThe company is involved in numerous space initiatives under a variety of different brands. The company has three operating segments: Space Systems, Imagery, and Services. The Space Systems segment consists of SSL, its communications and Earth observation satellite brand, and MDA, its space and ground infrastructure and systems brand. MDA is responsible for space robotics and defence.\n\nThe Imagery segment brand DigitalGlobe is responsible for satellite imagery and geospatial information.

Revenues increased by 51.8% over the second quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to the DigitalGlobe acquisition. The loss was primarily due to the huge increase in interest from its acquisition-related long-term debt. For the time being, debt is going to be a major drag on the company\u2019s financials. Investors would be well served to keep tabs on Maxar\u2019s ability to service this debt and still grow its earnings and cash flow.\n\nAs interesting as the company is, though, the financials are not too amazing at the moment. Maxar pays a nice dividend of almost 4%, although I am not banking on the dividend, considering the amount of debt the company has on the books. Nevertheless, there is a dividend at the moment, which should ease some investors\u2019 minds while they wait for the company to pay down the debt.\n\nIn order to create this company, Maxar made a number of strategic acquisitions, including that of Neptec Design Group, a Leading Space Sensors Company in Canada and the United Kingdom. Maxar paid US$8 million in cash and shares for the acquisition. This purchase, along with a number of others, has caused the company\u2019s total debt to skyrocket to US$4.2 billion of total debt as of June 2018. Considering the company has a market capitalization of only $2.3 billion, this is a little intimidating.\n\nEven though this company\u2019s financials are not that amazing at the moment, I can\u2019t help but be drawn to what it does. The business initiatives, like space propulsion, robotics, and artificial intelligence, are amazing new technologies, and this company is poised to capitalize on the new space economy. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this company on a financial level.

(Actually, since the company hasn't officially announced the shutdown, there could still be a sell-off to come, but at their last earnings, they basically came as close to announcing it without explicitly saying it) In other words, this was a bad acquisition for the company and everyone holding MDA stock at the time (double its current price), but not necessarily now depending on what exactly the current price reflects.\n\nOn DGI, I would be *very* surprised if they outright lost the EnhancedView contract given the moat they have in that area.  DGI's satellites are focused on extremely-high resolution imagery with a few big, expensive satellites, while the numerous startups that have recently appeared (including Planet) are focused on lower resolution high-cadence imagery with lots of cheap satellites. That's not to say that some of the stuff the government used to use DGI imagery for is better suited with Planet's imagery, but short of the NRO building and maintaining their own satellites (which they do to an extent, but is expensive), there's no real competition providing DGI's resolution. The biggest risk I see to DGI is if WorldView Legion is significantly delayed or goes way over-budget and derails their capex projections; the stock will probably crater if anything of the sort is suggested at the next few earnings calls.\n\nThe dividend should have little impact on the valuation, and I don't think it really matters if it gets cut or not. They have so much debt, that diverting the dividend to the debt isn't going to make a serious difference as to whether the company succeeds or not in the long run (at least while their cash flow supports it, which is currently true; rising interest rates could change that). I suppose that with a dividend, there's a risk of another sell-off if/when they do cut the dividend, but I'd expect that to be short lived.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous post, a leveraged stock like this behaves like a LEAP call without a defined expiration and should be treated as such---there's a decent chance of value going to zero, but also a decent chance of it increasing by many factors if the company actually does what they say they're going to do.

However,\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks that meet a certain profile, and reinvesting the dividends, can provide a better risk-adjusted return over long periods. \n\nThis profile is basically: \n\n- mature company with a long history of paying dividends, \n- reasonable dividend that is well covered by revenue (so no speculative mining stocks with 15% yield that may go bust next year), \n- and a history of RAISING DIVIDENDS EVERY YEAR (mega important), and\n- bought at a reasonable price (subjective, but generally not at its ATH, \n- with a growth story (reason it should go up, generally). \n\nThe nub being that if you buy a stock with a yield of 4% and it increases its dividend every year, the price will rise to keep the dividend yield around 4%, all else being equal. \n\nHowever, since the dividend has now been raised every year for 10 years you\u2019re actually getting 8-9% (for example) on your initial investment while new investors only still get 4%\n\nThat\u2019s the main point: reliable, constantly increasing income that grows as a percentage of initial investment and in absolute terms as you reinvest it. \n\nOver time, the theory and Miller\u2019s numbers say, this should outperform much sexier stocks and the S&P on a risk-adjusted basis.
