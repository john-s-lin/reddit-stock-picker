Understanding your risk tolerance (whatever it is) is so important in terms of investing because it allows investing to be a less stressful and more enjoyable experience for one, but it allows you to have a greater degree of clarity when things aren't good so that you can take advantage of opportunities and not be one of the people fleeing the market.\n\nI'm positive on the long-term cannabis story, but this is a long-term story and there's going to be a lot of volatility along the way.

(if there were discontinuities, then we could assume that these were split-induced, since, for a 2 for 1 split, the stock would be expected to drop by 50%).\n\nA few other points:\n\n1. KEY has been paying a dividend for many years.  The amount of this dividend should have been immediately been reflected in the dividends either credited to the brokerage account or sent by cheque.  Looking for records of the dividends paid may be useful.\n2. If the shares were in certificate form but dividends weren't received, then the company could owe the estate a pile of dividends.  There could be additional amounts, although its unclear who would own such windfall.\n3. $12 makes no sense as a cost of shares acquired in 1982 per that chart, and per the split ratios given on the KEY website ([http://investor.key.com/stock-splits-and-dividends](http://investor.key.com/stock-splits-and-dividends)).  Although technically its not your concern since its the Estate, not you, that is liable for the taxes.  However, if you go to that stock splits and dividends chart, and omit the two bottom splits (which someone else indicated may have only applied to preferred shares), a $2 acquisition price in 1981, multiplied by 2 \\* 2 \\* 1.5 perfectly matches up with a current cost base of $12.  Meaning that only 200 shares were originally purchased, at $12 each, and with 6X splits, the account now contains 1200 shares at a cost base of $2/share.  $2400 seems like a far more reasonable amount of money to spend, in 1981, on a single stock, than $14,400 which was the price of a nice mid-range car at the time.  Remember that all stock trades went through brokers back then with $100 per trade being a typical commission.  \n4. Its certainly possible that the shares were originally acquired as part of an entity which was then acquired by KEY, and the new shares issued accordingly.  With a $12 cost base due to the transaction.\n5. The legal administrator of your Uncle's estate will have to do most of the heavy lifting as to what the shares are worth, taxes, splits, etc.  Before actually going through the legal process of having the shares registered in your name.  So unless you've been appointed as such administrator, valuing and re-registering the asset is pretty much out of your hands.  Such administrator will have to seek whatever professional and legal advice is necessary to complete such transaction to the satisfaction of the legal requirements of administering an estate, and that of the IRS which will be owed its cut accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 21, "submission_ratio": 0.047619047619047616, "submission_title": "I just inherited some shares and I\u2019m clueless to what they mean", "submission_text": "My uncle just passed away and I inherited 1200 shares in Key Bank (Ohio) that were purchased for 12$ each in 1981.

Here is a link that goes into more detail: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php) . It's interesting to note that during the 2000 tech bubble crash, the market was at 142% of it's GDP meaning that the market was overvalued by 42% or by roughly $5 Trillion (Total GDP was only 10 Trillion). This was at the peak of the tech bubble before it popped and the market corrected. From 2003 - 2006 the market recovered and GDP and the market valuations were in sync.. then we began to inflate the market into 2008 and the market popped again. Since 2008, interest rates have been 0 and QE has inflated the market to historic highs.. the market is currently overvalued by 9 Trillion dollars and again is sitting at 142% of GDP. This is considered SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED territory, and with the economic contraction that's taking place.. GDP will decline further making the market even more overvalued... IMHO, the market is propped up on hype and cheap money/leverage...the value of the market will have to correct to meet our GDP and I believe that correction is starting and will continue for the next 2 years.", "parent_text": "What caused the dot com bubble burst? What trillion dollar issue was the surprise? It was volatility that drove investors out of stocks. And with interest rates rising finally to an attractive level, speculation will decrease and the market will decline. It\u2019s that simple. ", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}]
