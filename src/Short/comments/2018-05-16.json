It is not a matter of if it will, but when it will be adopted. Based on that concept, I foresee the bigger dogs like Bank Of America, IBM, Etc. perfecting the implementation of Blockchain and really utilizing it for the Core purpose it was developed for. Seamless encryption across multiple servers / networks. Throw a few more big names into the mix, and now you have a monster on your hands that can not be tamed. Example companies that invest into BlockChain related tech like Block One Capital or BKPPF will most likely be the first pioneers to benefit from this innovative ground breaking creation. I really view BlockChain as the brother / sister of Artificial Intelligence. We are on the verge of an era where it won't be just technology anymore instead it will be a heartbeat. Something we just can not survive without in our societies. Just like right now you can not survive without a cell phone, or you would go insane without it.
