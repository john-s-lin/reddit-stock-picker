Most of the companies that are already in your portfolio and the ones you have your eyes on are pretty solid though. I think adding a company like JNJ is a great choice and that you should add 2-3 more companies like them to your portfolio so you have some well established big companies in there that, while they may not grow the fastest, will not get hit quite as hard as some of the tech or small to mid cap companies.\n\nI think if you\u2019re going to invest in the weed sector that Canopy is probably the safest pick but it\u2019s a risky sector in general so the word safe is used loosely here. I personally use the ETF MJ for my exposure to the sector but if I had to pick one company it would definitely be Canopy. You just have to be really patient with this sector and willing to stomach the ups and downs.\n\nI think AT&T is a solid company to have on your horizons as well. Solid dividend and a utility company that should do ok if things get rough in the market. Visa is another company I\u2019m a huge fan of and happy to see amongst your holdings. Great company and stock to own. I\u2019m a big Buffett guy so I\u2019ll also toss Brk.B amongst my recommendations as well.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Disney personally. I just don\u2019t see them being that rewarding anytime soon despite the optimism surrounding them. I think the Star Wars and superhero films will get stale and over saturated. ESPN hasn\u2019t been pretty and Netflix and Amazon have really been looking good and aggressively expanding. Love the parks part of their business but I don\u2019t see anything else with them that really demonstrates to me major growth or returns, including the speculation about them getting more into streaming.\n\nOverall, not a bad portfolio if you\u2019re going to be picking individual companies. Just be aware that because you\u2019re fairly heavy on tech that you may experience some wild swings. Don\u2019t panic sell when they happen and don\u2019t get lured into companies that are the hottest topic of the week (ex. SNAP).\n\nYou may also want to add some international exposure to your holdings as well. Because you\u2019re young I would recommend an emerging markets ETF. This ETF has potential for some extreme volatility but the exposure to companies outside the US and with great potential is a nice addition to any young person\u2019s portfolio.\n\nI would also look into adding some REITs to your portfolio, especially within an IRA account if you have one. They pay solid dividends and offer some diversity in that real estate is unique in its own rights compared to more traditional stock holdings. They aren\u2019t as closely correlated to the rest of market so it will offer some additional diversity to your portfolio. They often get taxed pretty harshly though so it\u2019s important to put them in a tax advantaged account.\n\nI only bring them up because I didn\u2019t see anything regarding them but don\u2019t forget about keeping your eyes on bonds. You\u2019re young now so you probably don\u2019t need much bond exposure in your portfolio but I always recommend staying up to date and educated on them when the time eventually comes that you\u2019ll want to start shifting some of your portfolio towards them.

Is there any other company that I could look into?", "parent_text": "You\u2019re pretty heavy on tech here. Most of the companies that are already in your portfolio and the ones you have your eyes on are pretty solid though. I think adding a company like JNJ is a great choice and that you should add 2-3 more companies like them to your portfolio so you have some well established big companies in there that, while they may not grow the fastest, will not get hit quite as hard as some of the tech or small to mid cap companies.\n\nI think if you\u2019re going to invest in the weed sector that Canopy is probably the safest pick but it\u2019s a risky sector in general so the word safe is used loosely here. I personally use the ETF MJ for my exposure to the sector but if I had to pick one company it would definitely be Canopy. You just have to be really patient with this sector and willing to stomach the ups and downs.\n\nI think AT&T is a solid company to have on your horizons as well. Solid dividend and a utility company that should do ok if things get rough in the market. Visa is another company I\u2019m a huge fan of and happy to see amongst your holdings. Great company and stock to own. I\u2019m a big Buffett guy so I\u2019ll also toss Brk.B amongst my recommendations as well.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Disney personally. I just don\u2019t see them being that rewarding anytime soon despite the optimism surrounding them. I think the Star Wars and superhero films will get stale and over saturated. ESPN hasn\u2019t been pretty and Netflix and Amazon have really been looking good and aggressively expanding. Love the parks part of their business but I don\u2019t see anything else with them that really demonstrates to me major growth or returns, including the speculation about them getting more into streaming.\n\nOverall, not a bad portfolio if you\u2019re going to be picking individual companies. Just be aware that because you\u2019re fairly heavy on tech that you may experience some wild swings. Don\u2019t panic sell when they happen and don\u2019t get lured into companies that are the hottest topic of the week (ex. SNAP).\n\nYou may also want to add some international exposure to your holdings as well. Because you\u2019re young I would recommend an emerging markets ETF. This ETF has potential for some extreme volatility but the exposure to companies outside the US and with great potential is a nice addition to any young person\u2019s portfolio.\n\nI would also look into adding some REITs to your portfolio, especially within an IRA account if you have one. They pay solid dividends and offer some diversity in that real estate is unique in its own rights compared to more traditional stock holdings. They aren\u2019t as closely correlated to the rest of market so it will offer some additional diversity to your portfolio. They often get taxed pretty harshly though so it\u2019s important to put them in a tax advantaged account.\n\nI only bring them up because I didn\u2019t see anything regarding them but don\u2019t forget about keeping your eyes on bonds. You\u2019re young now so you probably don\u2019t need much bond exposure in your portfolio but I always recommend staying up to date and educated on them when the time eventually comes that you\u2019ll want to start shifting some of your portfolio towards them.

To answer your questions:\n\n1. The primary difference comes from the delta value of the 2 options. For example the AAPL 150 call for May monthly expiration is currently at 86 delta. This contract will gain 0.86 for every dollar move in the underlying. The same call for January 2019 expiration is at 70 delta. This contract will gain 0.7 for every dollar move. By looking at the deltas if you get the direction right the closer dated option gains more. But delta is a double edged sword and you will also lose more if you are wrong. The longer dated option is obviously much more expensive due to all of that time premium. It all depends on the timeframe you think your hypothesis will play out. \n\n2. No you can also profit on calls if the underlying does nothing at all. One of my favorite trades is buying calls leading up to earnings.

It costs more because you will also hold the stock over several earning periods, the time in which IV is highest. The longer term option is definitely a lot less risky. If the stock drops 5%, the first option will take a massive hit whereas the second will not drop as much. In other words, the delta is higher for shorter term options.\n\nAs for deciding which option to buy, it really depends on the stock and its movement. Is the stock you are looking for taking a big short term hit and expecting a sharp turnaround, then go for a shorter term call. If you want to \"leverage\" into buying more of a fundamentally sound company, then buying a long term call is worth it. \n\n2) You can make money on OTM (Out of money) call options. If the underlying increases, any call option will increase in value, simply put. The reason is because there is still time left for the OTM call for even more upwards movement towards the strike price.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "Options Questions", "submission_text": "Hello all, Can you provide some info on call options.

To answer your questions:\n\n1. The primary difference comes from the delta value of the 2 options. For example the AAPL 150 call for May monthly expiration is currently at 86 delta. This contract will gain 0.86 for every dollar move in the underlying. The same call for January 2019 expiration is at 70 delta. This contract will gain 0.7 for every dollar move. By looking at the deltas if you get the direction right the closer dated option gains more. But delta is a double edged sword and you will also lose more if you are wrong. The longer dated option is obviously much more expensive due to all of that time premium. It all depends on the timeframe you think your hypothesis will play out. \n\n2. No you can also profit on calls if the underlying does nothing at all. One of my favorite trades is buying calls leading up to earnings. The IV will keep climbing into the event and this will jack up the premium of the options even if the underlying does not move.
