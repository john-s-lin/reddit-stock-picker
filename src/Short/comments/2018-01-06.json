Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)\n- \n- Broadridge provides investor communications and other solutions to the financial sector. They are one of the pioneers in this industry.\n* Broadridge is a standing out in the blockchain trend bc they\u2019ve already completing a successful pilot test of a blockchain-based technology in collaboration with two large European banks in October.\n* The company partnered with JPMorgan in 2016 to successfully test its technology with shareholder proxy voting to make it easier and more transparent. Considering BR was already the largest U.S. provider of proxy voting services, it made sense for it to step in here.\n2. MasterCard (MA)\n- \n* Mastercard announced that it is now opening up its blockchain to certain banks and merchants as an alternative and potentially more efficient method of paying for goods and services.\n* They are targeting cross-border payments between businesses as the primary purpose for its blockchain, which can only be used by invitation.\n* Mastercard\u2019s blockchain operates independently and instead accepts payments in traditional local money which is seen by some as a positive. \n3. Microsoft (MSFT)\n- \n* Microsoft is committed to bringing blockchain to the enterprise and they are working with customers, partners, and the blockchain community to continue advancing its enterprise readiness through it\u2019s COCO Framework\n* Coco will be compatible, by design, with any ledger protocol and can operate in the cloud and on premises\n* By design, Coco is open and compatible with any blockchain protocol. Microsoft has already begun integrating E\n* Microsoft\u2019s intent is to contribute the source code to the dev community in early 2018\n4. Visa (V)\n- \n* Visa has rolled out the first, pilot phase of its blockchain-based business-to-business payments service, B2B Connect.\n* Similar to MasterCard, Visa plans to use the platform to ease cross-border payments by facilitating direct payments between institutions, cutting out the middleman the industry currently relies on.\n* Visa's global head of solutions, Kevin Phalen, said that the banks are trialing live bank-to-bank transactions over the platform. Following this first phase of the project, phase two will see the project move to a commercial launch, slated to occur in the middle of 2018\n5. Cisco Systems (CSCO)\n- \n* Cisco is one of the 200 organizations that are a part of the Enterprise E Alliance. These are governments and companies from all over the world, and multiple industries, testing out a version of E's blockchain\n* Cisco is also working to craft its own blockchain systems. In October, the company filed for the trademark of a blockchain platform that can identify different connected devices, monitor the activity of those devices, and evaluate how trustworthy those devices are when connected to a network. \n* It would also continually and automatically assess new devices when added to the network. In other words, Cisco believes it has a game-changing blockchain to track the Internet of Things.", "parent_text": "Big Companies Using Blockchain in 2018 These stocks, in my opinion, are solid companies that are delving into the blockchain for 2018 and beyond.

Look up block chain cloud storage, its already being implemented. \n\nThis is all new technology built around replication of data, of course it will be expensive if you want to store the same data on multiple networks(relative to putting data on a single server). Putting data on the cloud is more expensive than putting data locally too, you know. But do you know the difference in price today for putting data on the cloud versus 8 years ago? Vastly different. Remember when cellphones the size of a shoe used to cost thousands of dollars? How cheap are those phones now? $20-40 to have a phone that still does way more than that brick. And this is me excluding what smart phones have achieved. In tech, what is expensive today is cheap tomorrow . You only need to look at internet speed, performance of the hardware & storage spaces in devices and how all of this has changed in the last few decades to get a grasp of what I am saying. Computers of today would costs thousands more just three years ago if they had the same specs. This is what happens in tech overtime, it cheapens and becomes readily available. The same will be true for when data starts sitting on blockchain at cost effective rates. \n\nBut see everything is a *slight improvement* in tech until its not. Eventually the improvements end up making a completely different product from its original design.  The cellphone of today is completely different than the cellphone 15 years ago. Though it was a smooth transition with small features being added every year but if you put that 15 year old phone next to a modern phone, they are world apart different, one is just a flip phone while the other is a legit computer. This is a key point I want to bring up, because you are seeing blockchain as just a flip phone and thinking this is all it will ever achieve. While every major tech company is jumping all over a this... because they see the smart phone 15 years from now.\n\nAnd dont forget, efficiency & better security are things companies will pay a premium for, which is what this tech provides. As for Microsoft they offer block chain as a service that others can use to build their own block chain apps on top of. That's what will be profiting them, being the infrastructure that others can use to build their own things out of. So not everybody is doing the same thing to turn a profit out of it. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft go to the meta level and profit from there. Where as IBM partners with Walmart and create a whole [food tracking & safety system using blockchain that is set to completey transform the inventory management system at retailers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/12/14/ibm-walmart-launching-blockchain-food-safety-alliance-in-china-with-fortune-500s-jd-com/#413f5987d9c5). You think things like this aren't/will not be paid at a premium by companies like Wal Mart and JD? Of course they will. Because once it is in place it will be more cost effective, secure and more efficient than having to manually manage these things with dated software and services. IBM is rolling out the IBM Blockchain Platform and plans to offer 1,600 consultants to help implement and deploy the technology. That is a whole lot of consultants for a company investing in a tech that is just going to be a *slight* improvement.\n\nAlso some of these things are way beyond \"slight improvements\". Ripple does in seconds what Swift takes hours/days to do in banks. Its already changed the landscape of handling confidential data in a drastic way. There is a reason why banks are all suddenly collaborating with ripple in to integrating this system. Removing the trust requirement isn't a small matter especially with higher levels of confidential information (like the data you see in finance and the health industries). Company that uses block chain will be more efficient at pulling up/out the data than those that do not. The kind of things that give companies competitive advantages over their competition and allows them to save alot money that again would have been spent on compliance and data integrity service providers. And not all block chain is equal, this isn't just a small similar update across the board. Its all being used in all different kinds of ways by different companies who are engineering it in ways to make it more efficient at X versus Y. Even bitcoin, which at the moment is the longest living iteration of block chain is already dated... its slow and isn't very efficient relative to what some of the new technologies behind other coins can do(etherium). So there will be a demand and a industry build around improving this tech. The ones who do it better will make the most money as they will be the ones businesses/customers will gravitate towards. I also want to put it out there, IOTs will go hand to hand with blockchains. Something to keep in mind as IOTs become more and more the norm.\n\nAnd that my friend is why these tech companies are getting a piece of the pie now.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 14, "submission_ratio": 0.21428571428571427, "submission_title": "Big Companies Using Blockchain in 2018", "submission_text": "These stocks, in my opinion, are solid companies that are delving into the blockchain for 2018 and beyond.

This is so wrong on so many levels why is this comment upvoted and not called out? Especially with the \"fact checking\" condescending attitude you threw at OP while letting the irony of fact checking slip right past you. This subreddit I swear...\n\nDo you NOT know they own Call of duty or something? how can you even mention Activision without their bread and butter and focus everything on destiny to try to paint a shitty business?

Nor is it esports (atleast not at the moment) or candy crush man. Its Call of duty, which went in with no little to no competition this year (no battlefield this year + EA's battlefront 2 was a hot mess and rockstar's red dead redemption got delayed which was one of the most anticapted games of 2017). Being competitionless is not a insignificant boon that you should ignore. As this earnings that is coming will be massive for ATVI. I mean just read up on their earnings last year around February(post cod release) and that jump was with the \"half as successful\" call of duty.\n\nSeriously, read up on COD WW2: http://fortune.com/2017/12/15/call-of-duty-ww2-sales-best-of-year/. Realize that destiny still sold a lot of copies in 2017 (it was number one in sales until COD release) so effectively Activision will go in to the upcoming earnings while holding both number 1 and number 2 slot of most sold games in 2017. This earnings is the most anticipated earnings for ATVI in a long time.\n\nAnd for the record, I dont like Activision the company one bit. I hate all of their games just like I hate apple.

The goal of a swing trader and the goal of a long term investor are completely different for starters. A long term investor's thesis on a particular stock, ETF, commodity, or whatever they are investing in is that in ____ years the stock will be worth more than it is today, usually the time frame is at least 5+ years. And investors base this hypothesis almost purely on fundamental analysis like how is the management, what is the company's long term growth strategy, do they have a monopoly or competitive advantage over other companies. Whereas a swing trader typically bases their trades purely on technical analysis which takes into account price and volume patterns, measures of volatility, whether a stock is oversold or overbought, support and resistance levels, bollinger bands, so on and so forth. So therefore a swing trader's thesis has nothing to do with the company 5+ years down the line, maybe the company will be bankrupt in 5 years, they don't care, they interpret the charts a data to form their thesis. In simple cases their thesis is one of two things, will this stock be worth more than it is currently in 1-50 days, or will it be worth less than it is currently in 1-50 days. Time frames vary based on the individual and the strategy but typically are a minimum of a day or two and usually don't last longer than a month or so. For me I'd say my median holding period for a position is roughly 5-10 trading days, or 1-2 weeks. \n\nTo offer insight on your other question of \"why don't traders just hold a position even if it fails to return a profit short term\" is actually a more layered and complicated question than it would initially seem. A few reasons why I do not do this and why I'm sure many other traders also do not is because of the concept of discipline, trading psychology, use of capital, and time horizons. A disciplined trader sets predefined stop losses and profit targets **and sticks to them no matter what.** This is incredibly key to stay in the game long term, it will be hard to find a seasoned career trader that trades on emotions because any trader that does will most likely lose their shirt and lose it fast. Psychology falls in line with discipline, the hardest part of trading is the psychology behind it, not falling victim to biases (or minimizing the risks your own biases cause by trying to be aware that you have them), not being emotional in trades, never \"falling in love\" with a stock or position, and so on. And the use of capital is another huge one, if you bought a stock as it bounces off a support and you think it's going to make an upwards move but it doesn't and instead breaks through the support, you will have to sell anyways because you are disciplined and have a stop loss, but you will also not want to sit in a position you no longer have a thesis for why it will go up short term, and therefore your money can most likely be better off in another position. And if you can't find anything else that meets your predefined rigid trading criteria then you just hold cash until something does. Because capital is finite but opportunities are infinite.\n\nHope this offers some insight and answers a few of your questions!", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "New to Day Trading.

Especially if there's a stock I'm only expecting to go up $1-2 during my swing trade, if I bought commons it would barely be worth it so I'd usually buy the ITM calls that sat around 15-25$. Hope this helps contextualize it.\n\nBecause another thing is the deeper ITM the less % of the position a 1$ in teh underlying is.
