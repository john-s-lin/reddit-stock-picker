I pay $15 a month because I'm a math major and sometimes just don't feel like figuring stupid homework assignments out... if I type the exact wording of a problem into Chegg there is about a 70% chance that Chegg has the answer with steps for me. (For the upper level math courses it's more like 40-60% depending on the actual course, but for lower level stuff like Calc I-III, intro to Stats, intro to physics, linear algebra, etc. that percentage shoots up to 90% same goes for basic chem, bio, etc. I'm sure)\n\nI will give my guess to the growth narrative as well: Now as college becomes more expensive students will get wise to the rip-off that is $40K social science degrees ( that is unless you have connections, are a truly gifted networker, or from a top-20 university.) So more students with less aptitude for STEM are going to be taking STEM courses and relying on Chegg. Considering the relatively low cost of 15 bucks a month compared to the price of a degree it is worth it. Chegg is also typically the first result in Google search, even more than they were just last year imo. When you don't pay for Chegg but keep seeing that they have the answer but you just can't see it cuz your too cheap you get frustrated and eventually just bust out your card and sign-up at 2am... not that I know from experience or anything. When you realize Chegg saves you 2-4 hours a week you're not going to cancel it. \n\nRisk: I'd estimate that about 50% of Chegg's answer-bank is available else where for free and easy to find. Even higher than that if you feel like digging around the internet to try and find a correct answer. Also Chegg's quality control could be a little better and relies on people who aren't totally sure how to do the problem voting on how good the answer is... needs improvement lol. I'm not sure how the answer providers are incentivized, but I'm sure it is less costly than most subscription based service expenses, so I guess that is good. Maybe worth noting that college kids are generally cheap and I've heard they uhm just might share accounts between a few people. They do have a competitor or two (Course Hero, and I know there's 1 or 2 others) but I'm sure Chegg has the largest market share.\n\nI've seen on their web page that some of Chegg's revenue comes from text book services, and that shit ain't growing imo anytime soon. I do think they mostly rent so maybe they can maintain for a few years without losing any of that revenue, and the profit margins are probably pretty sweet if they're getting repeat revenue on used books. Most students prefer an actual book as opposed to digital. Shit maybe they're textbook revenue just might grow idk, I've never checked their actual quarterlies or revenue breakdown btw.\n\nAt a time where subscription based services often trade at a premium, and with a highly sought after demo I think Chegg is a solid bet. An acquisition is probs best case scenario but I'm not exactly sure who would target them off the top of my head. I bet their marketing costs are pretty big, but I just think that Chegg might be here to stay.

Play around with [this Kelly calculator](http://www.albionresearch.com/kelly/default.php) and see if it helps you. To be honest, I don't really know the math behind it well enough to give you an easy explanation, so this is just me pointing you in the right direction. Basically, the idea is that you're inevitably going to lose sometimes as long as the probability of winning is not 100%, which it never is in the market. Kelly Crit. helps you figure out what your maximum allocation to each investment should be that gives you the best statistical chance of not losing your capital.\n\nAnyway, I assumed you had $10,000 to invest to see what kind of numbers I got. Here's what I put into the calculator:\n\n    Bankroll: $10,000\n    Odds: 2 to 1\n    Probability: 50\n    Multiples of: $149.40\n    Minimum: $149.40\n\nSo if I assume that you have a 50% chance of \"winning\" on your investment in SHOP, and then I further assume that *if you win*, you will make back 2x your initial investment, your maximum allocation to SHOP should be $2,390.40, or 16 shares. Obviously, you can't know what chances of success are or what the payoff will be in the even that you \"win\", but it's not so much about giving you the magic number of shares to buy. The idea is to help you understand that while investing a higher amount may look like it will give you higher returns on a single bet, if you extrapolate that strategy out over your investing career, you are highly likely to lose your invested capital. \n\nYou also have to consider your time horizon. The odds of SHOP returning 2x your investment in the next 30 days are much lower than the same thing occurring in the next 5 years, for example. Unfortunately there's just no magic way to do this. I wish it were as easy as \"solve for x\" but you will have to make assumptions no matter how you approach it. In the end, it's better to make overly conservative assumptions and give up some possible gains than to make overly aggressive assumptions and risk losing your initial capital. Remember, a 50% drawdown has to be followed by a 100% gain just to break even. On the other hand, a 50% gain can sustain a 66% loss and still leave you in tact.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 135, "submission_ratio": 0.014814814814814815, "submission_title": "I present the best portfolio for the long term (not selling anything for at least a year)", "submission_text": "OK, now tell me why it's crap...

Play around with [this Kelly calculator](http://www.albionresearch.com/kelly/default.php) and see if it helps you. To be honest, I don't really know the math behind it well enough to give you an easy explanation, so this is just me pointing you in the right direction. Basically, the idea is that you're inevitably going to lose sometimes as long as the probability of winning is not 100%, which it never is in the market. Kelly Crit. helps you figure out what your maximum allocation to each investment should be that gives you the best statistical chance of not losing your capital.\n\nAnyway, I assumed you had $10,000 to invest to see what kind of numbers I got. Here's what I put into the calculator:\n\n    Bankroll: $10,000\n    Odds: 2 to 1\n    Probability: 50\n    Multiples of: $149.40\n    Minimum: $149.40\n\nSo if I assume that you have a 50% chance of \"winning\" on your investment in SHOP, and then I further assume that *if you win*, you will make back 2x your initial investment, your maximum allocation to SHOP should be $2,390.40, or 16 shares. Obviously, you can't know what chances of success are or what the payoff will be in the even that you \"win\", but it's not so much about giving you the magic number of shares to buy. The idea is to help you understand that while investing a higher amount may look like it will give you higher returns on a single bet, if you extrapolate that strategy out over your investing career, you are highly likely to lose your invested capital. \n\nYou also have to consider your time horizon. The odds of SHOP returning 2x your investment in the next 30 days are much lower than the same thing occurring in the next 5 years, for example. Unfortunately there's just no magic way to do this. I wish it were as easy as \"solve for x\" but you will have to make assumptions no matter how you approach it.

The fund is of moderate risk with about 2/3rds in stocks and 1/3rd in bonds. It\u2019s 10 years yield is 5.79% p.a. (that\u2019s including the Great Recession). There are no commissions if you buy thru Vanguard, but the annual fees are .14%, meaning for a $40,000 investment you\u2019d pay $56. \n\n>I basically have some simple rules:\n\t\u2022\tdo not sell whatever happens\n\t\u2022\tonly long term investment (3-5+ years)\n\t\u2022\tonly invest money which I don't need\n\n\nThe second and third rules are important, so I\u2019m glad you have them. The first rule will get you into trouble. Tell me, when you diagnose a problem at your work, do you change your opinion when new information comes to light? I would hope so. Well businesses and our knowledge about those businesses can change. In other words, if a new information comes to light about a business, you should be willing to change your opinion on that business. So while your rule is well intended, ie don\u2019t trade based on short-term fluctuations and emotions, it\u2019s inflexibility can keep you from making a rational sell decision. \n\nAlright best of luck!\n", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1520175708.0, "submission_id": "81waqd", "comment_id": "dv60pdr", "body": "Let me give you a friendly advice, if you want to convince someone with your opinion, you should explain why and give some arguments, otherwhise its useless.

Trust me I've been there, I've lost a lot of money, and I've made a lot of money. So for your sake, try to paper trade. Here's something I would advise you to do. \n\nSo as of Friday, Mar 2 $MCD was trading at $148. Tomorrow, (Monday) you should look at the options chart and decide which strike price you are purchasing. Keep in mind options are not available for trading premarket & after hours, so there won't be any real time information. Since you \"think\" it's going to trade up, you can really purchase any strike above $148. Let's say you choose a $150 strike for Friday, Mar 9. Once the market opens, look at what the premium is, WRITE IT DOWN, that is the price in which you are entering the trade. You can be profitable IF $MCD reaches $150 that same day (Monday), because the premium will have risen significantly, and at that point you can turn around and sell it back to the market (I do this). OR you can wait it out until Friday\n\nLet's say the premium you \"buy\" (please don't actually buy it if you're not 100% sure on this, use it as a learning experience) for a $150 strike right out of the open on Monday is worth $50. THREE things will happen if you wait it out until Friday:\n\n1 $MCD will not move at all and your option will be like an ice cube in the dessert. Each passing it will be losing value due to the greek, Theta. So by Friday $MCD is still at $148 and your $50 option is now worth $0. \n\n2 $MCD goes to $153 and you decide to exercise your option, meaning you'll buy 100 shares of $MCD at $150. Congrats you now made ($153-$150) * 100 or $300. Keeping in mind this trade will cost you $150 x 100 shares ($15,000) to execute. THIS IS IF YOU ONLY BOUGHT 1 CONTRACT. If you do not have that $ in your account, YOU CAN NOT exercise your option. \n\n3 $MCD tanks and closes at $145.

I'm sure there's many ways to improve this, but here is what I would do based on what you said above.\n\nUnless there was some event that made me sure that it would hit that price _this week_ I would buy myself some time to let the trade work.  I find that direction is not nearly has hard to get right as timing, so I would look for options that expire in 4 weeks, so let's say the April 6th 2018 calls (calls because you are simulating going long of course)\n\nI choose ATM options usually but I'm not %100 sure they are the best choice yet.  If your win rate is high, slightly OTM options might be better because gamma (the rate of delta change) is highest for ATM options, so as your options go from OTM to ATM, then ITM you are gaining leverage at the fastest rate possible.  Anyway, ATM calls are 148 and selling for roughly $4.50 at Friday's close.\n\nI size the trade based on how much I consider a stop amount.  Although there are many trades I exit early, even if they are down, options can become worthless so fast I feel it's best to be expecting to lose the full amount at any time.  You probably won't start losing money to theta until three weeks out though?  (I'm not sure but someone can correct me on this if I'm wrong).  So let's say I'm willing to lose $1000 on this trade, that puts me at 2 calls for $900.  So $900 total at risk, but if you stick to a week I imagine you could get out with at least $300 or so.\n\nI put in a good til cancel order for half of the position at %100 profits.  So in this case to sell one call at $9, which pays for the trade when it gets hit.  Then psychologically it's much easier to let the other half ride.   good luck, ymmv, don't do anything I just said and all that.\n\nEdit:  A week later these calls are trading at 10.50 ish.

Wether to buy ITM or OTM calls is up to how much money you want to tie up in the trade.  For example, the March 6 150C is selling for $1.45 and the March 6 140C is selling for $9. The 150C only requires $145 but requires MCD to be over $151.45 to start making money. The 140C needs $900 but starts making money with MCD over $149. \n\nYou could also sell a put and buy a deeper out of the money put for protection. For example, you could sell the March 6 150 P for $2.88 and buy the March 6 147P for $ 1.80. This would leave you with a  $108 credit and max loss of $192.
