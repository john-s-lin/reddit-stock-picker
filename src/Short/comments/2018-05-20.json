The first company you may want to look at is John Deere(DE), as they will be supplying many farmers with the heavy machinery required to farm hemp, and sales in the US should increase dramatically over the next few years. Scott\u2019s is another (SMG), they have acquired many key chains in the supply side of Cannabis already, and I see them being heavily involved in Hemps future.\n\nLastly, look at the Cannabinoid side of the Hemp plant. CBD is the most common known compound when talking hemp, but there are many more beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes within certain hemp genetics. These hemp plants are quickly being labeled \u201cDrug Plants\u201d and pharmaceutical companies are working to isolate and run clinical trials on each individual compound. One of the first companies to do this is GW Pharmaceutical, they have been working on hemp for drug purposes for nearly 20 years, and have a FDA clinical trail in phase 2 I believe.\n\nI believe all three of these companies will see greater than average growth over the next 5-10 years as the hemp industry evolves and flourishes.
