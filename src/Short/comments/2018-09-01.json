This question gets asked pretty often and we typically remove it to avoid clogging up the subreddit. However I\u2019ll just lock the thread and leave it up for now as some good advice was provided by our members. Along with the advice provided here, I\u2019d also recommend checking out the side bar in our subreddit for some good resources and links, it\u2019s not everything but it\u2019s a good starting point. While it\u2019s not perfect, Reddit\u2019s search engine can help at times for particular topics or stocks too. Investopedia and Finviz are both awesome tools to use.

When i was in school i learned most of everything, in conjuction with my textbooks, through investopedia.com\n\nHonestly, i'd look to see what textbook your introductory level Finance classes are using and buy that. Maybe even pick up an Accounting 101 book.\n\nA Finance 101 book will tell you everything you need to know. Everything else just builds off of that information and you can pick up what you need to learn later easy on. I say a college book because those books aren't as wordy and all that like books written by others.\n\nIn fact, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/) has their own articles written on Corporate finance/investing. The topics you learn from Corporate Finance easily transfer over to Personal Finance/Investing.\n\nI can 100% vouche for investopedia that they are a great source. They can explain topics in 5-10 minute reads. Sometimes you have to read over it again and again to grasp, but its all good stuff.\n\nMatter of fact, don't buy a college text book, just buy a notebook and begin taking notes from investopedia.

I wanted a Top 10 stocks to buy and hold for the next 42+ years but i could only find 9. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/PIrJpJL](https://imgur.com/a/PIrJpJL)\n\n$STZ Constellation Brands - My biased rock since i work for the company and get a small discount, Alcohol liquor wine & beer is a solid market and people are going to always be sinning. Cannabis has been added through CGC. Cons: I work there; would really hurt if company was hurting causing a tumble in stock price & job loss, resulting in a double loss of no job and no money.(hopefully this doesnt happen since its alcohol but you never know)\n\n$CGC Canopy Growth Corp. - Marijuana, its like getting in on alcohol at the end of prohibition! Cons: Is it overpriced right now since its a hot pot stock? Who knows we will see 10 years from now. since STZ owns a large stake this portfolio might be overextending into just these two but i believe i should hold both incase CGC blows the fuck up and doesnt get taken over by STZ.\n\n$MSFT Microsoft - Have been using Windows my whole life and will never convert over to mac. Most of the business world uses microsoft products such as azure cloud & excel document softwares. Good presence in gaming, Xbox & PC master race. Seriously its just so much easier to use windows over apple and more cost effective its nuts. Cons: google has competitive softwares like google docs n spreadsheets (but you can never replace windows)\n\n$GOOGL Alphabet - Its Google. I will always use google over other search engines, im a GMail for life, im part of that google \u201cecosystem\u201d now and i use products such as Drive, Docs, YOUTUBE. My phone runs on their Android OS. Cons: not many cons other than a large market cap.\n\n$TSN Tyson - Meat. Cons: ??\n\n$WM Waste Management - to take away trash because theres always going to be trash & i like their name, can you name another trash service ? theyre like Band-Aid Cons: ??\n\n$COST Costco - Where i purchase the majority of my meat & food, kirkland products are good. Cons: i go to other stores if im too lazy to drive. They make a lot of their money from memberships and they have 90million members, (327million amercicans) thats basically a member every household already so how much more growth do they have really?\n\n$DG Dollar General - Theyre a retailer that targets people and communities that cant afford to shop at places such as Costco or Whole foods (most likely not in the same towns) and areas where Walmart is not able to penetrate. Own a lot of their own storefront locations. Cons: just a retailer, 99 cent store, dollar tree, etc\u2026.\n\n$BRK Berkshire - It would be easier to list the industries in which Berkshire Hathaway Inc. doesn't turn a profit. Companies owned and picked by Warren Buffet. Its large and safe.

So I'm open to ideas and hearing any advice/guidance/tips/feedback any of you experienced investors could give me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, but I've tried to put some work into it, to make it relatively easy for you to read. Firstly I have tried to explain my situation, what I want, and then I give an overview of each asset in my portfolio so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LOCATION**: Spain, so I'm not allowed to buy ETFs that trade outside of Europe through my broker...\n\n**FUNDS**: Right now I have 22k\u20ac invested, but eventually will go up to 150k\u20ac\n\n**GOALS**: Long-term returns, aiming at a 10-year or 12-year time. Assuming some risk, but nothing crazy.\n\n**NEXT STEPS ETFs**: I'm looking at buying horizontal ETFs such as S&P, SmallCap, Emerging Markets, etc, and also ETFs that are sector-specific, such as Ishares Clean Energy, Digital Security, Ageing Population. (problem is my broker doesn't give me access to many of the ETFs I want, so I'm thinking of changing to another broker.\n\n**NEXT STEPS INDIVIDUAL STOCKS:** I'm going to look for companies in sectors I don't have yet. I was thinking air travel as the next one. I would like to buy companies that have good long-term prospects but have recently gone down, such as Tencent, Alibaba.\n\n**DOUBTS/QUESTION FOR YOU**: So far I have half ETFs half individual stocks. When I invest the remaining 128k\u20ac, I think I'm going to go mostly for ETFs, because I don't see myself as reaching a good diversification on my own and rebalancing my portfolio constantly.\n\nHowever, I'd still like to maintain some individual stocks as well, to \"bet on a few winning horses\", so to speak. For example, as a gamer I love Blizzard, and I think the company has a lot to offer. Same with Tencent and some others. **Is this stupid of me?** Am I assuming a **really bad risk/return ratio by investing on my own in a few individual stocks of companies I believe in, instead of just putting it all into ETFs?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is an overview of my portfolio so far, with percentages of total portfolio, tickers and sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Stocks: 51% of portfolio***\n\n3,52%-JPM/JPMorgan Chase: **Financial Services**: 8 shares valued at 880$\n\n5,61%-BBV/BBVA: **Financial Services** (Spanish bank): 250 shares valued at 1.235\u20ac\n\n5,10%-V/VISA INC-CLASS A:  **Financial Services**: 9 shares valued at 1275$\n\n3,65%-IBE/Iberdrola: **Energy** (spanish energy company). 120 shares valued at 804\u20ac\n\n4,20%-CEPU/Central Puerto: **Energy**. 100 shares valued at 1050$\n\n1,74%-OXY/Occid Petroleum: **Energy**: 6 shares valued at 435$\n\n5,97%-NND/Tencent Holdings: **Technology, Entertainment**. 40 shares valued at 1.314\u20ac\n\n2,77%-ATVI/ActivisionBlizzard:  **Technology, Entertainment.** 13 shares valued at 610\u20ac\n\n3,75%-BABA/Alibaba Group: **Technology, Ecommerce.** 6 shares valued at 937$\n\n4,28%-GOOGL/Alphabet INC: **Technology, etc:** 1 share valued at 1071$\n\n1,60%-CVS/CVS Health Group: **Healthcare**. 5 shares valued at 400$\n\n1,83%-ZBH/ZIMMER Biomet: **Healthcare**: 4 shares valued at 458$\n\n1,96%-GES/Gestamp: **Automotive** (Spanish car part manufacturer): 80 shares valued at 432\u20ac\n\n5%-F/FORD Motor: **Automotive**: 135 shares valued at 1.250$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***ETFs: 49,01% of portfolio--****-I've tried to buy accumulating ETFs when possible, since they're more tax-effective here in Europe.*\n\n15,96%-**Ishares** CORE **S&P 500**: 15 shares valued at 3.512\u20ac\n\n15,65%-**Ishares** CORE MSCI **Emerging Markets**: 150 shares valued at 3.444\u20ac\n\n3,15%-**Ishares Automation and Robotics**: 120 shares valued at 693\u20ac\n\n14,25%-**Ishares** Edge MSCI **World Value** Factor: Focuses on companies that trade below fundamentals: 120 shares valued at 3.562$", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.022222222222222223, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread September 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

Now that I have quite a few individual stocks that I like, about a half to two thirds of my monthly deposits go into S&P 500 and the rest into individual stock picks.\n\nApart from this portfolio, I have a retirement fund that tracks the MSCI World Index, where 4.5% of my untaxed income goes. I cannot get a retirement fund match from my employer, as I work part-time (I am a uni student).\n\nWhat do you think?

However, I think if your looking for a long term investment this company will be legit. They are based out of Gatineau, Quebec. Right now they only have a 400,000 square foot facility but are currently building a 1 million square foot facility. They also already have a beverage deal with Molson Coors. They plan to create many marijuana products which are not popular or relevant but may take off once the drug is legalized such as cbd cream. I think that they will dominate the cannabis market in Canada in all aspects. That being said Aurora has international trade agreements and I\u2019m not sure about Hexo\u2019s international plans.\n\n\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.011111111111111112, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread September 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

Or, it may be considered a \"dang it, well I don't have enough money to buy a single share of *everything* that interests me :(\". Here's what I mean:\n\n- VYM gives exposure to a lot of promising dividend stocks I wish I had at the moment. Most of the top companies in that ETF are things that most people want, so I won't give specifics.\n\n- VOO & SPYG at even weights: exposure to Apple, Home Depot, Facebook, Boeing, and even a little Disney among other things while bolstering what I'm confident in enough to have specific shares of - Amazon, Microsoft, Visa, etc.\n\n- VBR was something of a \"let's see how hungry the little guys are\".\n\n- VGT works the same as my VOO/SPYG choice: to bolster my position in Microsoft/Visa/Google/etc. while overlapping with the Apple holding in VOO/SPYG to further give me some exposure to it all while also granting exposure to other promising things I don't have such as Nvidia and Paypal.\n\n- XAR is a funny thing to me. My specific defense choices are sort of a homage to major plane contractors from WWII days. XAR's holdings in my single choices are not all that big, so this one is more about diversifying within the sector itself and expanding on the belief that defense will never perish.\n\n- VOOG is basically a replica of VOO/SPYG so the one share from not long after I started is pretty unnecessary in terms of how many things show up in my list, but it does well so I haven't had much reason to sell it.\n\n- SPYD is a stable loose change/\"well, if I buy 1 dollar chicken sandwiches at McDonalds for lunch this week\"/\"Lockheed just gave me 4 dollars a share this quarter!\" catcher.

I probably should have included more info from the start.\n\nI'm in my mid 30's. No debt. Maxed out 401k and started a second retirement account for direct pre-tax withdrawal from pay.\n\nI'm not a financial expert by any definition, but I will do my homework. Also not interested in day trading or short term (under a year) investments.\n\n1. I view most of these investments as long term - years, if not decades. A couple of the smaller investments, such as Tencent, likely will be shorter term. I recognize that I have a fairly high level of risk since I don't own real estate or bonds but I am trying to seek out growth potential. Ideally, this money leads to retiring earlier than I would otherwise without the investments.\n\n2. Honestly, I inherited the first two mutual funds (Vanguard & Columbia), have had nice growth with them over the years, and continue to feed them. Based on family advice, these two accounts were great for having a passive retirement fund that would grow over the years (as they had been successful over with similar strategies over the past decades). At first, these were the only investments that I had until I started making a little more money and became interested in being active in my money management. Also from what I have read, small cap growth funds have been outperforming large cap.\n\n3. I have more in LH because it was one of my first investments. I have been in a related industry and still know a few people, so I view the company as stable with room for growth. They are one of the largest (2nd to Quest) networks of clinical labs in the country and have developed products/services that we nearly all use.\n\nYou are right to question the disproportionate nature of the investment and I have read similar advice elsewhere. So thanks for pointing it out. As I continue to make further investments, I will grow other portions of the portfolio with the intent of eventually reducing the disparity.\n\nAt this point, I don't look at any of my investments with great concern. I know that there will be ups and downs (that market correction is coming and will be rough). But I intend to ride out most of the chaos and think long term. It is glorious to not have debt hanging overhead.\n\nWith all of that said, I am open to input from whatever good source that I can find.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.03333333333333333, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread September 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

The 1.45 Sharpe ratio is good. Obviously, these assets have performed well during this period, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they will keep performing well in the future. I do like your plan to add more weight to VTI. Although you lower your expected return a bit, you also reduce your risk. Most importantly, you reduce some of the Microsoft specific risk you are taking. Your portfolio is currently 74% diversified in relation to the total US equity market. The new portfolio would be 89% diversified and that is a significant improvement!\n\nI would also say that 2 years is a relatively short period, when you think about long term investing. Considering we are on one of the longest bull runs in history, there is a chance the market will turn in the near future and that your portfolio won\u2019t have time to recover.

Sure, there are other ways of investing but why would you not try to buy undervalued businesses? Then you will have double potential for profit. Correction as well as future growth. In the long run the stock will follow earnings, it's a proven fact. I believe microsoft is an alright buy though, still a bit overvalued  in my opinion. I might buy it if it drops more. I think you'd be better off getting Apple.\n\nLook at the crazy valuations of tech companies in the early 2000s, and look what happened to them in the following years. It's hard not to apply that to the current situation. I would not be able to sleep at night knowing I bought amazon and square. And yes, normalized P/E compared to earnings is a pretty good indication of the markets valuation of a company, of course that is not the only thing I use. I look at rating, debt, cash flow, P/B, dividend payout ratio among others.

I mean, the \"magic number\" for diversification is 30 - personally I like about 15. You can diversify by sector, country, etc. as well. The concept of this is that you're spreading out your risk. if one stock tanks 15% it won't hurt your overall portfolio too much. The reverse is also true. As well with this many stocks, buying and selling will eat you up with fees (depending on your portfolio size and cost of trading).\n\nTrim it down a bit, maybe sell and lock in some gains. The more you diversify the more you spread out the risk, but you're also limiting your upside.\n\nOn a side note, let's do some guess-math. for example, you have 45 holdings, (I think) - if you're portfolio is say 150k, that means you have approx. $3000 invested in SHOP. at $15 a trade that's already a 1% shave (one buy and one sell) off any return on SHOP. Even worse for everything below it (which is about half of your number of holdings). And to be honest if your portfolio is 150k-200k+ where this obviously wouldn't make a difference, I would look into some wealth management firms. You can always have a \"me\" account where you trade like 50k, and have the rest (majority) of your wealth professionally managed. \n\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.022222222222222223, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread September 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

I mean, the \"magic number\" for diversification is 30 - personally I like about 15. You can diversify by sector, country, etc. as well. The concept of this is that you're spreading out your risk. if one stock tanks 15% it won't hurt your overall portfolio too much. The reverse is also true. As well with this many stocks, buying and selling will eat you up with fees (depending on your portfolio size and cost of trading).\n\nTrim it down a bit, maybe sell and lock in some gains. The more you diversify the more you spread out the risk, but you're also limiting your upside.\n\nOn a side note, let's do some guess-math. for example, you have 45 holdings, (I think) - if you're portfolio is say 150k, that means you have approx. $3000 invested in SHOP. at $15 a trade that's already a 1% shave (one buy and one sell) off any return on SHOP. Even worse for everything below it (which is about half of your number of holdings). And to be honest if your portfolio is 150k-200k+ where this obviously wouldn't make a difference, I would look into some wealth management firms. You can always have a \"me\" account where you trade like 50k, and have the rest (majority) of your wealth professionally managed. \n\n", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 1.5}, {"time": 1538709377.0, "submission_id": "9c3apm", "comment_id": "e77153k", "body": "Ya mother is a whore FYI ", "score": 0, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.0, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread September 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

Please note that VLKAY shares can no  longer be sold from an account. However, there are two offers available  for ADR holders to participate in.\n\n**Option 1**: Holders may surrender 1 VLKAY ADR for 2 unsponsored ADRs  (VWAGY). An unsponsored ADR is an American Depository Receipt that a  bank issues without the participation of the foreign issuer of the  underlying stock; in this case Volkswagen AG. The $5 per 100 ADR  cancellation fee and $20 cable fee are waived for this offer.\n\n    OR \n\n**Option 2:** Holders may surrender 5 VLKAY ADRs for 1 ordinary share  (VLKAF). This ordinary share is traded on the German exchange. There is a  $5 per 100 ADR cancellation fee and a $20 cable fee for this offer.\n\nBoth of these offers expire on 02/11/2019. However, to allow time for  appropriate processing, the TD Ameritrade cutoff date for participation  in either offer is 02/07/2019. Instructions for either offer can only  be processed in multiples of five.\n\nIf you choose to participate in either of these offers, please know  that we have not been provided a timeframe for delivery of the new  securities.\n\nIf you would like to participate in either offer, you may call us at  800-669-3900 or send a secure message from within your online account.  Please note that we cannot accept instructions via a standard non-secure  e-mail message. Choose \"Reorganization and dividends\" from the \"Choose a  topic\" dropdown menu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you choose not to participate, upon expiration of the voluntary  corporate action offer the Depositary will sell any securities  represented by outstanding American Depositary Shares.
