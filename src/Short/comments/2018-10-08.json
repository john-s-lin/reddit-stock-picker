Pair this with the fact that Brazilians are increasing their use of cc for purchases at a very high rate (mostly a cash economy a while back) and that Brazil\u2019s economy is the B in BRIICS, this stock really is setup to have explosive growth. The biggest risk is associated with the country itself. Brazil has rampant corruption but I consider a lot of that associated with the government and B2B transactions. Seeing as this company is more of a consumer driven business, I don\u2019t think too much of the risk though. Also. Their revenue growth numbers and merchants signing up are double digits. Also they\u2019re making a profit and beating analysts estimates often. I don\u2019t know what their growth strategy is outside of Brazil but it\u2019s a fairly new stock that was trading below ipo as of end of last week. And Brazil is fking huge. So it probably has its hands full until it decides to move to neighboring countries. SQ on the other hand is not focused on emerging markets but rather developed economies. They\u2019re going for British market for growth and probably moving towards the rest of the EU shortly after. Probably because of the increased infrastructure that is similar to the US.

Tesla has a number of advantages over traditional car manufacturers.  For example, other manufacturers have to share some of the profit margin on vehicle sales with their dealership networks, whereas Tesla's direct to consumer model allows them to keep it all and as Ron Baron pointed out the other day generates a massive cash float. Traditional car manufacturers however are dragging their feet going electric in earnest, because they'll eat into their own margins and obsolete their massive investments in ICE manufacturing infrastructure by doing so.\n\nSentiment around this stock is crazy polarized. It seems like people either have a 1-year price target of $0 or $500.  The way I see it, if we get back to $350 that's a pretty good gain from here.\n\nNegativity around the stock is at a fever pitch.
