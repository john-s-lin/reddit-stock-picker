They offer great prices but also upgraded memberships that include more perks such as the ability to go to more than just one gym. Listening to their last earnings call early this year they mentioned how most of their franchisees own more than one facility and they are making huge technological investments into their machines so gym goers can connect their workout statistics with their phone to get a better idea of what they need to do to improve. This will be a very important source of health data which the company can use to better cater their offerings to their customers. Also all of those old brick and mortar KMART, Sears, etc locations are being scooped up by Planet. I will be following their international expansion closely during the next earnings call as well.

If you want high growth you\u2019re going to have to take on considerable risk. This means your chance of missed and failures increases. If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably better off with a specific fund or ETF that focuses on growth stocks. Again just be aware that while these things have performed pretty well, these items can also be fairly volatile. These are all vanguard ones I but most of the big brokers offer the same or very similar ones that more or less track and use the same principles.\n\nTotal Stock Market ETF. This ETF covers a few thousand companies in various sectors and of different sizes. It has averaged just under 10% returns the last ten years. It\u2019s ticker is VTI.\n\nVanguard US Growth Fund. This mutual fund covers hundreds of US companies that have potential for strong, future growth. Ticker is VWUSX. I like this Fund a lot and use it myself. It has averaged just over 10% the last ten years.\n\nVanguard Target Retirement Funds. You can select the year you wish to retire and it will adjust your portfolio to meet the level of risks recommended for your age. In your case, instead of entering the date of your retirement you could use the date ten years from now. These funds will vary depending on what year you use but if you\u2019re putting it ten years from now the holdings will be a little on the conservative side.\n\n\nThese funds all offer diversity, have solid track records, and carry moderate risk. Diversity is important because you don\u2019t want all your eggs in one basket (one company). Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to successfully pick winners out of individual companies with little knowledge and experience. Even then, luck plays a role as well which is way I recommend funds/ETFs over individual companies.\n\nYou could also look into specific sector ETFs that are often associated with higher risk/higher rewards like technology, financials, healthcare, or discretionary staples. Again, just remember the risk is there and right now is a tough time to be getting in with many of these companies and funds with such a long bull market and high valuations. International ETFs like emerging markets is another one as well but probably much riskier in reality.\n\nA few final notes. Remember that past performance doesn\u2019t mean future performances will follow similarly. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to just suddenly start picking winners and outperform people who do this stuff for a living or computers with incredible capabilities. It\u2019s almost always a good idea to diversify. And finally, if something has potential for high returns, it likely has much risk associated with it.

Their growth is about equal with the commercial services industry, but due to their size, have much more free cash flow compared to the rest. Their profit margins are very similar to the industry average, but WM uses their assets and investments \\(trucks and facilities\\) to a much better effectiveness compared ot the competition.

The following are all compared to the industry average. WM has a lower P/E, PEG, Price/Cash flow, Price/sales, and price/book. These are all signs that the stock is undervalued compared to its industry, and the whole market in whole. Their growth is about equal with the commercial services industry, but due to their size, have much more free cash flow compared to the rest. Their profit margins are very similar to the industry average, but WM uses their assets and investments \\(trucks and facilities\\) to a much better effectiveness compared ot the competition. For example, their Return on equity and Investments is more than 2x better margins than the industry average. WM debt is fairly high, but the industry itself has high debt to equity ratios in the first place.\n\nThe only problems overall I have with WM is the fact that they arent necessarily making enough money to pay off their short term debt \\( debt due in a year or less \\). This is analyzed based off of their Current ratio which is 0.80, compared to the industry average of 1.36. A Current ratio under 1 usually signifies that a company is having a hard time paying off their short term debt.\n\nIf WM can keep up their growth at the 12&#37; expected EPS in the next 3\\-5 years, I have no doubt that that along with their high, valuable Return on Assets will get them out of their slightly dissapointing debt problems. Being the fact that they are a leader in the industry, they should be a staple for anyone looking to invest in the Environmental and commercial services area.

This is annoying.  \n\n* LAM guided flat shipments but revenue should keep increasing. The obvious thing to ask is where this increase comes from. In Q&A there was a not so well articulated question to this effect. From what I understood, LAM didn't have the breakdown, but it is reasonable to assume that the revenue is coming from their business of servicing the shipped devices. This is something that they highlighted in their investors day presentation - over half of their revenue comes from service and this proportion keeps rising with every shipped device.\n\n* They didn't repurchase more share cause they are still moving money to US after the tax reform. The corporate trading window goes from 2 weeks before earnings to 2 days after earnings. My guess is that they have accumulated enough fire power throughout the two weeks to resume repurchase soon. This should help nudge the trend following wallstreet denizens and the stock price in the green direction.\n\n* Unfortunately, a drop after great earnings is becoming the trend in semis. MLNX had great earnings, dropped 3%. ASML had great earnings, dropped 5%. Other semi stocks tanked yesterday: KLAC, TER, AMAT. Volatile ICHR posted -8%. IMO, after the recent market turbulences many investors are sitting on stop-loss orders and it takes a small initial nudge to initiate a sell off. Let's see how this plays out next week. INTC, AMD, TXN, MKSI, TER, KLAC and others will be reporting.

Everything was really easy to navigate and book, I was really pleased and satisfied with the site. Still haven\u2019t gone on the actual trip yet so we\u2019ll see if everything goes smooth but I thought they were great to use minus the dozen advertising emails I get every day from them now despite unsubscribing from them!\n\nMy guess as for their rise and now sudden dip is that the economy performing so well, consumer confidence, and low unemployment have made people willing and able to travel more the past few years than they were a decade ago. This is great for the industry as a whole but there are other factors as well. Factors that may not exactly benefit Expedia.\n\nThe first is probably the increasing popularity of AirBnB. The company has received much praise and attention the last year or so which I\u2019m sure is leading to people avoiding Expedia. AirBnB can often be cheaper and easier to book than hotels or platforms like Expedia, especially in areas that have high traffic. Some people renting on the site can really offer a great and enjoyable experience. They have tried to counter this a bit with their HomeAway platform which focuses more on cabins, townhouses, condos, and apartment units as well as homes but the platform has had limited success and wasn\u2019t cheap.\n\nExpedia also faces some stiff competition as well besides AirBnB. Priceline and Trip Advisor are two of it\u2019s bigger competitors. Priceline looks to have been doing fairly well after a few bumps in the road. There is also rumblings of Amazon getting into the industry as well (what don\u2019t they have their hands in!). It\u2019s probably priced in already but worth noting that this is a tough time of year in regards to travel as well, things should start picking up soon with better weather and summer nearing.\n\nA quick look at their financials doesn\u2019t show anything too alarming and they look to be in decent shape book wise. One thing that makes it tough for a lot of companies right now is that the market has been on such a crazy run the last few years that it takes a lot to make everyone happy. Meeting expectations doesn\u2019t mean much and failing to meet them can really hit you hard. Hell, we\u2019ve seen quite a few companies beat expectations only to see their stock dip because it wasn\u2019t enough. Expedia missed expectations the last few quarters and its expected that while they\u2019ll meet them this past quarter, they won\u2019t exactly exceed them.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest here. I\u2019ve spent the last 45 minutes or so reading about them and the sector so I\u2019m not exactly the most informed person on this company or the sector. I can\u2019t really find anything that stands out, good or bad, with them. However, I do see a lot of \u201cblah\u201d meaning that they seem have sort of become stuck in where they are.\n\nGiven their recent performances and current price, it\u2019s not a company I\u2019d be too interested in owning or buying based on what I\u2019ve seen thus far. However, I\u2019d admittedly have to give them a better chance with more research to give a true and more precise answer.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 6, "submission_ratio": 0.16666666666666666, "submission_title": "Expedia $EXPE", "submission_text": "Why did it do so well last year and been falling off ever since?
