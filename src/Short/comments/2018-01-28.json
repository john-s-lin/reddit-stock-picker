They lost half their 401k in the dotcom bubble burst, so stopped contributing and put it in cash. Around 2007 they thought they market recovered so went back into equities and started contributing again. By 2009 they lost almost half again and went to cash. Again. Within a decade they managed to lose 50% twice without ever making up for it.\n\nThey completely wrecked their retirement. If they just stayed the course, stayed in equities, and kept contributing, they'd be doing great now.\n\nThat's the last I talked to them because I don't work with them anymore, but it wouldn't surprise me if they waited this long to get back into the market again.

I sincerely couldn't understand this part. How could the portfolio of a high return asset and a low return asset have better performance than just having the high return asset?\n\nThanks again.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 330, "submission_ratio": 0.0030303030303030303, "submission_title": "a serious WSJ warning today", "submission_text": "An article was released in the WSJ how after missing out on the 9 year bull market, individual investors are finally pouring into the stock market. \n\nThis is often a sign of a market top.

There are tons of zero follower pumper shills, bad traders, trolls, 100-200 follower pumpers and bashers etc. But it only takes a couple of days before you start to screen out all the junk automatically. \n\nMy brain shuts out the '*buyout coming', 'contracts in a week'*, and the repetitive pump posts now and it only takes less than a minute to open a new tab and see if another user is legit or not. \n\nThere are also slightly more subtle P&D tactics, a tricky one at first is the \"*INSIDER BOUGHT LAST MONTH! TO THE MOON*\" when they were code A acquisitions (a director was gifted x amount of stocks) and the insider didn't actually buy at open market, which is code P. You can always double check by going to fintel.com. If it's a code S (an insider sold), there will always be someone to fact check if it was a preplanned divestment or not. On the INTC board the Krzanich sale got argued/debated to dead horse territory with lots of slurs vs. here on reddit and the finance and tech sites it's a several weeks/couple months lag. \n\nSo where is the real value? ST is ultimately a social platform but the real dialogue takes place off of it after you connect with someone. Two users following each other can dm each other and you can reach out and offer to exchange contact details (mostly discord), the worst that can happen when you reach out to someone is they just don't respond. Everyone is looking relentlessly for an edge, and finding likeminded people with the same goals is part of it. \n\nThe most important thing about following ANYONE is that you still have to be your own trader/investor and *know when to exit on your own*.\n\nA year ago I thought pretty cynically that these guys don't post exits a lot of the time. But now I look at it another way: thousands of $$ are at stake, they're managing 2-3 day trades or 5 or 6 swingtrades at a time and it can get hectic if two runners are going at the same time. \n\nIn the 30 seconds it takes to sell a stock at an intraday's top or the swing's top and to jump back onto ST and post that they've sold, the stock can already tank. Then if you're not following the action and you don't have the sell order already there with the cursor on submit/confirm, or maybe you hesitate after seeing a post, it's already two minutes into the panic selloff/profit-taking. If there's a circuitbreaker or halt, you are going to be paying 100% attention to your own trades. There's not enough time for handholding. It's the market, everyone's priority is to protect their own capital and make money for themselves 1st and foremost. \n\nWith that said, I wanted to share an informational, non-technical user that I follow: \n\n**https://stocktwits.com/HedgeMind** - insider and institutional buys, the main 'follow the money' update source I've found. They're more geared to hedge fund and institutions. I used to follow \nhttps://stocktwits.com/cctranscripts/ideas - conference call transcripts and news releases. This one also does insider buys and sells, but a lot of them are just small sells by the odd director which creates a lot of noise. It's not a buy reason alone but you can check the board and see if bigger names pop up, look at the chart, check finviz and see what the company has been doing the last couple months, start the DD process. \n\nThe two other functions I use Stocktwits for are to pick up watchlist candidates and keep track of the overall market. I think most of the users you should follow should be the traders/speculators so you have a pipeline of stocks to rotate into after one batch runs. I also follow a few guys who are good readers of the SPY, the bear/volatility ETFs, US Dollar Index etc to keep track of the economic background and market sentiment/price action. For example, in the week of Jan 15th with the government shutdown and SPY double-topping, I only made two trades, took a 2-3% loss for each, just waited it out. I didn't hedge but there were guys that didn't want to liquidate their positions, so they correctly timed picking up UVXY and then ended up green on a week most traders/investors were down or flat.
