My fuel doesn't come from China and neither does the electricity or any of my day to day items. We eat strictly organic at my house and mainly local. I haven't bought electronics in years and last time I did that was 3 years ago. The clothes I wear don't come from China, they come from mexico mainly. Unless China makes my golf balls, I just don'y see it having an impact on my life at all. It will hurt major corporations, but they just received a substantial tax break last I remember. So I'm not going to feel sorry for them, I'm sure they'll manage just fine. \n\nMy point being, I live a fairly comfortable lifestyle. If these tariffs mean I don't go out and buy the latest and greatest electronic device every year because prices have gone up, then so be it. It's not hurting any necessity I need to live. People complained companies were getting TAX breaks that only make the rich richer and now complain those same companies are being hurt by Tariffs. So which is it? And whats the solution? Are you not in agreement of free or favorable trade agreements? Shouldn't we be able to trade back and forth equally? \n\nWhats your plan for how it should work? I'm genuinely interested. Please don't take this as an assault or confrontational.

Obviously I don't know you, but I would still bet that you have or use a substantial amount of made in China merchandise.  \n\nThat's the silly thing about a trade war - no one can predict the outcome or the damage to the economy because things like sub-assemblies in vehicles, airplanes, and electronics aren't easy to track, and this is just one example.  If you're living in this country you come into contact with these items daily, whether you even own them or not.  Do you own an office chair?  Silverware?  Plates and mugs?  Do you ever go out in public?  Eat at restaurant, or own a house?  What percent of your house was manufactured in China?  Do you invest in the stock market?  Do you plan on buying anything that is made with aluminum or steel?  So unless you don't participate in society at all I think you'll be affected.  \n\nYes, you could probably put off buying some kind of discretionary electronic device like a new iphone, but should you have to?  And what does that do the US economy over time as millions make the same decision to delay a purchase that you would delay?  And what will the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and everyone else do to jobs in the US?  Just ask the soy bean farmers in the midwest how they feel about it.  This is bad deal for everyone, not just for corporations. \n\nI'm completely on board with free trade* (it's never actually been free, generally tariffs between 3%-6%).  The idea is that the market delivers goods to consumers in the most efficient possible way. That means lower prices for everyone.  It's true that some industries in the US will not be as efficient as foreign competition, but this cycle has been going on for hundreds of years whether we like it or not.  I don't see any textile mills operating in my neighborhood, and the last horse and buggy shop shut down a hundred years ago.  I'm much happier this way than the alternative - which is where the government picks it's own winners and losers, and makes us all pay for the balance.    \n\nPersonally I'm against the tax breaks, I think they're stupid and overwhelmingly geared towards the top income earners while leaving everyone else behind.  So now the US government has decided to take away even more of my money and your money in the form of tariffs.  Great.  \n\n", "score": 4, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 354, "submission_ratio": 0.011299435028248588, "submission_title": "Global stocks are in the red this morning as US President Trump has allegedly asked trade officials to implement tariffs on USD$200bn in goods imported from China", "submission_text": " \n\n### US Stocks\n\n* **Global stocks are selling off this morning,** following news that US President Donald Trump has told aides to proceed with implementing tariffs on an additional USDS$200bn in goods imported from China while officials in Beijing are considering declining the US invitation to hold trade talks later this month.

It astounds me that people don't understand how insurance pools work: the premiums of the healthy help offset the expenses of the ill, while the insurance company looks up actuarial tables, sets the premiums and pockets the difference.    \n\nThat's a rough system you describe. I mean, sounds like setting up a tripod, kicking a leg out, then wondering why it's not standing.    \n\nI'm not American. I live in a country that would be deemed a \"socialist hell-hole\" by some segments of US society. Actually one of the easiest countries in the world to create companies in.   \n\nPopulation 4.4 mill, so maybe 1/4 that of New York. Top tax rate is 33% at 70k. Corporate tax rate is 28%. Income tax is applied against all income, globally. Goods and services tax of 15% on everything. Effective 1% tax for socialised insurance against personal accidents. No right to sue for cause in accidents. No capital gains tax.   \n\nKnow someone who got brain cancer - his treatment and consults didn't cost a dime. Flew him between islands and provided accommodation next to hospital for his Oncologist appointments and subsequent chemo and radiotherapies. Collective bargaining for a range of medicines means that for that range of medicines, scripts are maybe $3 each, including effective chemo. Sure, that's a subsidized cost, and you're not getting flown around if you need a hip replacement, but that system is part of what our taxes go for. If you can get someone back on their feet then they don't need to be propped up.   \n\nWe can go private too if we need to. It costs extra, but it's an option. Those private services can't stray too far because they're competing with an effective \"low cost\" public option that keeps them honest. They find sufficient profit in the arrangement to thrive.    \n\nWe're a capitalist society with significant socialized underpinnings, but we can make it work with just 4.4 M people.

The answer here is, of course, that unless Mueller is holding back something huge (which he should have released before justice confirmations) then truly all we have is suspicion. Suspicion can be a powerful tool, it can sway elections and bring down powerful people, but when you\u2019re dealing with the level of distrust that today\u2019s conservatives have, you need to be concise with your claim and your evidence should be able to eliminate doubt.

It astounds me that people don't understand how insurance pools work: the premiums of the healthy help offset the expenses of the ill, while the insurance company looks up actuarial tables, sets the premiums and pockets the difference.    \n\nThat's a rough system you describe. I mean, sounds like setting up a tripod, kicking a leg out, then wondering why it's not standing.    \n\nI'm not American. I live in a country that would be deemed a \"socialist hell-hole\" by some segments of US society. Actually one of the easiest countries in the world to create companies in.   \n\nPopulation 4.4 mill, so maybe 1/4 that of New York. Top tax rate is 33% at 70k. Corporate tax rate is 28%. Income tax is applied against all income, globally. Goods and services tax of 15% on everything. Effective 1% tax for socialised insurance against personal accidents. No right to sue for cause in accidents. No capital gains tax.   \n\nKnow someone who got brain cancer - his treatment and consults didn't cost a dime. Flew him between islands and provided accommodation next to hospital for his Oncologist appointments and subsequent chemo and radiotherapies. Collective bargaining for a range of medicines means that for that range of medicines, scripts are maybe $3 each, including effective chemo. Sure, that's a subsidized cost, and you're not getting flown around if you need a hip replacement, but that system is part of what our taxes go for. If you can get someone back on their feet then they don't need to be propped up.   \n\nWe can go private too if we need to. It costs extra, but it's an option. Those private services can't stray too far because they're competing with an effective \"low cost\" public option that keeps them honest. They find sufficient profit in the arrangement to thrive.    \n\nWe're a capitalist society with significant socialized underpinnings, but we can make it work with just 4.4 M people.

Now ive been long $ATVI for a long time, so lets start asking more questions.  OP the biggest gap to close is your thinking of timelines in terms of investment.  If all you care about is the next few weeks, youre essentially gambling.  The money from these games (BO4 and BFA) isnt in Q3 earnings or very partially.  BFA preorder has been available for a long time and bridges Q2 also.  Many investors and all institutions have had this priced in for a LONG time. When you're looking at something like this, think MUCH longer term, not hey whats happening next week.  Whats $ATVI's Q4 going to look like?  Listen to their Investor Calls.   What about all of 2019?  Whats their upcoming road map of the next couple years.  They have hundreds of people working on things that wont be released for years. $ATVI's largest user base is from King but you didnt mention that at all.. The makers of Candy Crush.  Im still long on $ATVI, just for different reasons.  Look further down the road when looking at stocks, these games were looked at many moons ago.  Blizzards Q2 was down, would you expect Q3 to be down compare to Q3 2017?  Probably not, not with a new expansion.  So when Q3 is up, it doesn't exceed expectations.  The realistic expectation is that their Q3 will be better than it was last year.  The question will be how much money did it bring back and is that number bigger than expected\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere, lots of great info to get more of an understating\n\n[https://investor.activision.com/events-presentations](https://investor.activision.com/events-presentations)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 22, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 10, "submission_ratio": 2.2, "submission_title": "Call me crazy but $ATVI is about to go to the moon.

When you're looking at something like this, think MUCH longer term, not hey whats happening next week. Whats $ATVI's Q4 going to look like? Listen to their Investor Calls. What about all of 2019? Whats their upcoming road map of the next couple years. They have hundreds of people working on things that wont be released for years. $ATVI's largest user base is from King but you didnt mention that at all.. The makers of Candy Crush. Im still long on $ATVI, just for different reasons. Look further down the road when looking at stocks, these games were looked at many moons ago. Blizzards Q2 was down, would you expect Q3 to be down compare to Q3 2017? Probably not, not with a new expansion. So when Q3 is up, it doesn't exceed expectations. The realistic expectation is that their Q3 will be better than it was last year. The question will be how much money did it bring back and is that number bigger than expected\n\nI agree with both of you... but pre-orders are absolutely going to see a huge spike after this BETA's success. The game plays fantastically and they're going to eat PUBG's lunch in terms of user base once it comes out (not sure about Fortnite).\n\nTo your point, we will know more about their roadmap at Blizzcon (1st weekend of Nov). They're notoriously slow, errr \"patient\", when releasing games, so even if they announce a new Diablo game, it probably won't impact the company financially for a few years in terms of revenue.\n\nI'm very positive on ATVI going forward, but do think it's going to be more long term than people think.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1537189167.0, "submission_id": "9gi3hl", "comment_id": "e64o2vc", "body": "Agreed, I'm more of a battlefield fan and have EA calls but the blackout beta was amazing.

There's no way they'll ever be profitable and I just don't see how they'll last. They only have one product. They are losing millions of user a quarter. Nothing they can do will really bring people back. \n\nBut that's not the answer you're looking for. What would I do if I had to turn that load of shit around? \n\n1. Market the product (advertising space). No small business advertises on snapchat. Every small business advertises on Facebook. Why? Because they know about it. Do something. Hand out free $100 ad credits. Just something. Get businesses to try it out. \n\n2. Try to renegotiate hosting. There are like 15 providers now. There were what? 3 when snapchat was founded? That's basically their only expense. Cut those costs.\n\n3. Lay off like 70-80% of the current workforce. We do not need to be paying developers $250,000 Los Angeles salaries to make dancing hot dogs. Why the hell do you need 2000 people to manage an app? Keep people to bring updates and smash bugs, keep a team to brainstorm new ideas. Keep it lean. Move if you have to. Nothings keeping you in LA, nothing except their asshole CEO and Founder lives there. I KNOW it's not that you're trying to stay where talent is, or they'd be in the valley. And they just need standard non-exotic devs. They aren't doing cutting edge AI or something. They don't need Stanford machine learning computer science theoretical quantum physics PhDs. They're just running a simple app. \n\n3. Spin off all your unprofitable subsidiaries you over paid for. Like they have Zenly, Looksery, Flite, etc... \"who?\" you ask. Exactly. They've spent about a billion on acquisitions and those have done nothing to help the bottom line. Sell them asap. \n\n4. Create an actual product. Probably smart glasses. Not the dumbass ones you made and literally tried as hard as you could to prevent people from buying. I mean seriously are your trying to lose money. They set up theses snapglass vending machines in select markets and people had to find them (and you had to pay people had to maintain them). They could have put them for sale in their app and would have sold 1 million in an hour.\n\nSo they need to make a product. Good smart glasses this time, 5-10 styles. Nothing too sci-fi (yet), just listen to music, take pictures if you want, maybe collaborate with some eyeglasses company or something and create a lens edition. Use your brand. Sell for 30-50 percent margins. I don't know do something create some kind of product. Diversify into something that might make money. Into something so that when a celeb tweets that she can't stand an app update your company doesn't shed a billion in value in 5 minutes. \n\nThere. That's it. Hopefully your cash on hand outlives your plan. \n\nBut nothing like this is going to happen. Best case they get bought by facebook for a billion or so. No activist can do anything because of the way their shares are structered (no voting rights). Why should their dumbass CEO care. He's already cashed out his billions. They're fucked.

Farming in the US for small and medium sized farming operations is unsustainable. Not because of environmental reasons or anything like that. It's just the control corps have on making the little farmers incapable of making the money they should be making. Realistically farming without heavy reforms to strengthen the ones that work so hard to keep it up will fall sooner than later. If this speeds up the process I'm all for it. The Government will obviously bail out the farming industry because it's a threat to our national security to not be self sufficient with food production. This will obviously come as a big expense to the rest of US. But it will cause massive reforms like we saw with banking after the 2008 recession. When you run a country that puts dollars before sense. It takes market adjustments to force changes where they are needed. Outside of that it's all Laissez faire. That all being said, our food shortage issues can be fixed with stimulus packages and bailouts...Chinas economic problems are really showing through across many industries. The fact they've been lying about their numbers only strengthens my opinion that they are far worse off than we are. I truly hope farmers can get the reforms they need without the complexities of a bailout or other drastic means. Hopefully I'm right and this trade dispute ends within the next quarter. This weeks performance in China will certainly paint a better picture. Te new tariffs have been announced and we will get a better idea of China's next response.

But see how vague and subjective this is? Many times, company growth does equal growth of the stock but you cannot say it is always true. It is an indirect relationship, not direct. Take MU as a popular example. The company has been growing revenues significantly for the last year, yet if you look at their share price 1 year ago, their stock hasn\u2019t grown much at all in this time frame. There are all sorts of worries about their future success that prevent the share price from catching up to their revenue growth, for now. \n\n> why not let it stay at the same price per share?\n\nThere is plenty of manipulation in the market. Big institutions taking actions to purposefully lower the share price of a fast growing hot stock so that they can buy it cheaper. But for the most part, with so many players involved, it\u2019s difficult to have any sort of coordinated effort and it\u2019s a free for all.
