This is an important one. First let me throw [John Oliver\u2019s episode about retirement savings](https://youtu.be/gvZSpET11ZY ) at you. It\u2019s funny and he gives a good overview of some similar topics.\n\nFor some further info, here\u2019s the literal definition from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp), \u201cAn index fund is a type of mutual fund with a portfolio constructed to match or track the components of a market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500). An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure, low operating expenses and low portfolio turnover. These funds adhere to specific rules or standards (e.g. efficient tax management or reducing tracking errors) that stay in place no matter the state of the markets.\u201d\n\n**What does that mean?**\nTrying to \u201cpick winners\u201d by buying shares of individual companies is extremely hard to do. There are very few people on the planet who can do it consistently.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock market *as a whole* is pretty reliable. It goes up and down for sure, but over the past 100 or so years the S&P 500 has grown by an *average* of about 7% per year. If you could afford to buy a single share of every company in the S&P 500, you\u2019d stand a good chance of making solid money over time. Most people can\u2019t afford to do that by themselves though. Too expensive.\n\nAn index fund allows you to throw your money into a pot with a bunch of other people, then use that pot of money to buy shares of 500 companies *together*. \n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re hungry and you feel like pizza. You want pepperoni, Hawaiian, AND barbecue chicken, but buying three whole pizzas is expensive and you only have $10. So instead of doing that, you have a pizza party. A few buddies each add their $10 and you order together. Now each of you gets 1/3 of three kinds of pizza for the same price as one whole pizza.", "score": 5, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "How should I get started?", "submission_text": "I just recently become extremely interested in stocks and I've done non-stop research for about the past week.

Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level.

It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level.

It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level.

It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level.

It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level.

It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome trading week this past week, and are ready for the final trading month of 2019! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**\n*****\n> Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.\n*****\n> That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.\n*****\n> \"I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. \u2026They want to give themselves a little flexibility.\" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.\n*****\n> He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,\" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.\n*****\n> Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.\n*****\n> The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.\n*****\n> Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.\n*****\n> OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,\" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.\n*****\n> West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.\n*****\n> Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.\n*****\n> Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.\n*****\n> \"Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?\" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. \"We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.\"\n*****\n> Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.\n*****\n> Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.\n*****\n> Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TwgPqgW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xvvYd2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/AaI52il.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/A6pKXio.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYV8vt6.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/36bu7sv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/67TY2hK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JR8ZPPQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/d6YD1WB.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZDejXPD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uptUIct.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# December Almanac: Top Performing S&P 500 Month\n\n> December is the number one S&P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It\u2019s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market\u2014near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.\n\n> Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.\n\n> Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our \u201cFree Lunch\u201d strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing \u201cFree Lunch\u201d stock selections. The \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.\n\n> This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch\u2019s now famous line states, \u201cIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.\u201d\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In the last seventeen midterm years, December\u2019s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession\n\n> The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers\u2019 new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).\n\n> Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research\u2019s Five Forecasters.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.\n\n> Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 3rd, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$LULU** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$AVGO** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$FIVE** \n> * **$COUP** \n> * **$DOCU** \n> * **$FNSR** \n> * **$RH** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$CLDR** \n> * **$RMR** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$SIG** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$TOL** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$MDB** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$PLCE** \n> * **$GMS** \n> * **$HDS** \n> * **$OLLI** \n> * **$PDCO** \n> * **$HQY** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$MOV** \n> * **$SMAR** \n> * **$BNED** \n> * **$DLTH** \n> * **$HOME** \n> * **$CONN** \n> * **$MIK** \n> * **$GIII** \n> * **$AVYA** \n> * **$BIG** \n> * **$FGP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YavHQCG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZaHYy8e.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 3rd, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzIJs5p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.3.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0pDISK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0pMQuxm.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.4.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PEDrEbO.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UblAsga.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.5.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D2amymq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8Andhia.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.6.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9qUJwxL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/00iT36j.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.7.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $132.55 \n> **lululemon athletica inc.

I have also long been holding a pool of ETFs, MFs and REIT's, but I've started to reach a point where my individually held stock portfolio approximates diversified US blue chips, with easily determined dividend performance. Not as diversified or properly weighted as my goals but returns on it have been quite satisfactory relative to major indices.\n\nI'm a US based investor in my mid-30s, with an eye towards FIRE. I was very fortunate to season my investing awareness during the lead up to the dot-com crash, and to be able to dollar cost average major positions of my portfolio in aftermath of the 2008 crash. Psychologically, I prefer to buy and hold for long term positions, making ~5-1 ratio of buy vs sell orders. I generally only sell portions to harvest gains to from my best performers stocks for rebalancing or to harvest losses/free up capital on severe underperformers. \n\nI am fairly risk averse, such that I don't want to be reliant on selling off slices of capital, with the hope that market growth exceeds my basic costs of living when I am retired. I have greater confidence with dividends in this regard, but would be fine with eventually realizing some gains to help fund discretionary expenditures.\n\n**What do I want to have in my portfolio? Two forks:**\n* Workhorses- Steady dividend performers with some growth. I have been allocating with a goal of matching my yearly expenses on products/services I get from that industry(e.g. ATT or TMUS would be candidates to help cover recurring cell phone service fees). The core idea is to hedge for price growth/inflation associated with a particular industry, and gradually build up confidence that my portfolio can consistently support a FIRE lifestyle with a healthy margin of error, regardless of the mood of Mr. Market. The pattern is not a hard and fast scheme, some industries such as utilities are overweighted relative to expenses(with proceeds going to categories such as taxes), while others such as hospitality I have not been finding too many good options so far. In any case, the thing to understand is I use a spreadsheet which I use to associate streams of dividend income to predictable clusters of my living costs, which I've found really good to tie things together in terms of \"how much is enough\". Dividend stocks I prefer tend to be at a below average PE of say 14-16, with a yield of ~1.5% or more.\n* Showhorses - Strong growth stocks with outsized impact and expectations in our present and future world. I fluctuate on my level of FOMO, but about 20-30 percent of my holdings can be bucketed here. I usually try to pick up stocks from this category on bad news when I feel the market over-corrects - FB and AAPL were fall season additions to the bucket.\n\n**What has been going well?**\n* I got a few growth equities \"on sale\" during our recent dips, with money I have been added to my accounts. Portfolio declined less than major markets.\n* Diversification helps moderate out the unfortunate picks(GE and BAYER come to mind for the current market cycle).\n\n**Observations:**\n* Knowledge & decision challenges of direct investing on a broad range of stocks- Investing directly in a diversified set of stocks really challenges you to do sufficient research and understand the forces affecting each additional company. When I started, it was easier to focus on industries I had more first-hand knowledge of. The process is forcing me to broaden my horizons as an investor, and be more systematic about my decisions.\n* Business Cycle seasonality & Trends - I am not a market timer for moving in/out, but some industries have major seasonality, for which some stocks will just stay down for good reasons. I need read up and build up a stronger knowledge base on business cycles to help prioritize where to focus new investments.\n\n**What am planning to change:**\n* International Exposure: Only 8% of my portfolio is internationally diversified outside of US. Broker transaction fees, mediocre performance, overseas taxes and high mgmt fees on int'l funds have historically kept me limited here. Given that US growth could be more volatile in coming years, I'd like to increase to about 12-15% this year, with about 10-15 new positions. I've been starting to plan out some higher expense mutual funds I will tap, to start up an account with Interactive brokers. Some initial forays into foreign stocks I made with funds in a retirement account was a boneheaded mistake, due to  sub-optimal tax treatment on the dividends, but it was a lesson learned, as a mistake \"in the small\".\n* Food, travel/hospitality and health/biotech are three areas I am comparatively under-exposed on.

I\u2019m 22, started investing a few months ago, still at uni (in Europe, no student loan fortunately), and working part-time as a SW engineer.\n\nMy portfolio is currently at about 3.5k \u20ac ($4k) and I invest about 300 \u20ac monthly (depends on my monthly pay, I am paid at an hourly rate). I am investing for the long term.\n\nLast time I posted ([PanPirat comments on Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread September 2018](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9c3apm/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/e820icq/)), I was way too heavy in Tech. I still have a lot in the sector, but I\u2019m slowly working towards a better balance.\n\nMy current individual stocks:\n\n- **ADBE** -  6.18%\n- **AAPL** - 7.99%\n- **BA** - 9.16%\n- **JPM** - 5.22%\n- **JNJ** - 6.74%\n- **MSFT** - 8.07%\n- **SQ** - 6.87%\n- **UNH** - 6.36%\n- **V** - 7.20%\n- **WM** - 4.84%\n\nMy ETF holdings:\n\n- **Developed Markets Property Yield** - 1.94% \n- **NASDAQ 100** - 5.41%\n- **MSCI Emerging Markets** - 3.04%\n- **MSCI WORLD (ex USA)** - 2.17%\n- **S&P 500** - 18.81%\n\nSince my last post I ditched **AMD**, **MTCH**, **NOW**, and unloaded some **SQ**. I didn\u2019t sell any of these at the best possible time, but at least I only lost money on **SQ** - I still believe in the company (a lot), but I had too much of the stock in my portfolio for me to be comfortable. I bought **AAPL** last week and **JNJ** this week. In December, I bought **UNH**, and **JPM** and I increased my **WM** position in November.\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to add **AAPL** and **JNJ**, but at these values these stocks seemed way too oversold. I wouldn\u2019t buy **AAPL** at its ATH, but it lost $300bn of market cap and I believe that in the long run I won\u2019t regret this decision. They have tons of cash and they could afford several huge acquisitions. I believe that the stock could still drop some, but I already consider it oversold. **JNJ**\u2019s scandal seems overblown and sensationalist to me, after I looked into it a bit more than just reading the headline of the Reuters article. The stock did quite well when the market was dropping a lot in October, and then it lost $40bn in market cap due to the scandal. They will definitely lose the trust of some customers, but baby care is only a tiny segment of their products. They have many other brands that people don\u2019t even know are under J&J. It is a dividend king and it helped my diversify a bit.\n\nI\u2019ve been increasing my position in **S&P 500** during the correction (nearly doubled its weight in my portfolio). I added an **MSCI EM** and an **MSCI World** ETF, and a developed market **REIT** ETF. I added these three recently and I would like to keep increasing their weights in my portfolio.\n\nMy current near-term considerations (not really plans) include\n\n- adding some shares of **ILMN**, **EDIT** or **CRSP** (probably not all three of them), I\u2019ll have to do some more DD\n- adding some more bank stocks - maybe adding more **JPM**,  I\u2019m considering also **BAC**, **GS** and **C** - but I\u2019ll need to look into this more\n- buying some **NVDA** - at its current price it is getting attractive and as a young investor I like aggressive growth stocks. I didn't like the stock at its ATH, that seemed extremely overvalued, but it seems reasonable now.\n- finally buying some **BRK.B**\n- looking into other sectors - mainly utilities, services, consumer - any suggestions?\n\nApart from this portfolio, I have a retirement fund that tracks the MSCI World Index, where 4.5% of my untaxed income goes. I cannot get a retirement fund match from my employer, as I work part-time.\n\nI\u2019m really liking where my portfolio is going.

The following is the specific breakdown:\n\n AB High Income 3.3%\n\nPIMCO Foreign Bond Instl 3.4%\n\nPIMCO Inc Fund Instl 4.5%\n\nPIMCO Sht Term Fund Instl 11.3%\n\nVanguard 500 Index SACG 5.8%\n\nVG REI Fund Admiral SHRS 5.2%\n\nAmerfunds Grw Of America 4.8%\n\nAmerFunds Perspective  4.9%\n\nVG Int Grw Admrl Shares 4.8%\n\nAmerican Funds New World 10.4%\n\nMFS Mid Cap Growth 9.2%\n\nSS RSL SMl CAp Grw NL 8.5%\n\nAmefunds 2025 TD Ret 6.3%\n\nAmerfunds 2030 TD Ret 6.2%\n\nVangaurd SM Cap Value Ind 4.6%\n\nVG LifeStrat Grw 7.0%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe decision making process used to elect the stocks in my portfolio was not much of a process. To say that I used a strategy would be an overstatement. The specific break down of my portfolio is the following (commentary included) : \n\n \n\nBGFV 23.35%; average cost $3.06. Plan to continue buying until I have doubled my holdings or my average cost hits $3.50. I believe that it would be reasonable for this stock to hit $5.00 per share in the next year or two. So far I have experienced a 18.05% loss. \n\nBKEP 15.91%; average cost $1.58. I am not optimistic for this stock. I think realistically this stock could hit $1.80 per share in the next year or two. I am debating if I should continue buying until I double my holdings in order to push my average cost down. I would not continue buying once it hits $1.25 per share and beyond. I have experienced a 29.75% loss with this stock.   \n\nSIRI 27.56%; average cost $6.06. Do not expect much appreciation. If stock hits $7.00 per share, I would jump ship and wait for it to dip back down to under $6.50. I mostly want the dividends. I will continue buying until I at least double my holdings as long as average cost stay under $6.50.  I have so far experienced a 9.27% loss. \n\nBAC 28.49%; average cost $25.22. Don't expect much appreciation, but I think it would be reasonable for stock to hit $28 in the next year or two. Not sure if I would sell at that point. If it hits $30 without any new developments then I would sell. Mostly holding for the dividends. 10.11% lost here. \n\nI am looking to expand into processed foods, consumer goods, or cannabis. No potential candidates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong post.

I'm actually pretty new to some of the tech names I am buying but I thought what the hell. Some of the names have been beaten down frankly by things that don't effect the business so hopefully the relief rally sees money going in to these names.

I have a decent amount in savings so I decided to put $1000 in the stock market. I also will add $25 a month to my account, and more if I manage to save more that month. I'm looking for long term investments to grow my portfolio and just want to get a solid foundation for myself going forward. This is what I have right now:\n\nVGT 66.94%\n\nLVHD 23.21%\n\nSRET 9.85%\n\nMy current allocation is pretty much all American equity. I am comfortable with my current portfolio, although I want to add a little more into SRET. After that I'm looking to get into international equity, mostly emerging markets. I am thinking I want to eventually allocate my assets so that I end up with around 60% domestic equity, 10% in developed markets, and 30% in emerging markets. I'm not sure if that seems like too much international investment though? \n\nAlso do you guys have any suggestions for good international ETFs like what I described? I'm only investing in commission free ETFs on Etrade because of the relatively small amount I'm investing. Right now I'm looking at VSS because I currently lack much small and mid cap stock, so it would be a good way to diversify internationally and by market cap at the same time.\n\nAny other advice is welcome! I know that was a lot of info, but since I'm just starting out I want to make sure I'm not making any noob mistakes. I feel confident in the research I've done before investing, but there is no replacement for experience which I don't have yet.

I'd like to get thoughts on both my picks and anyone's experience with the Chase You Invest app compared to others out there.\n\nI understand RobinHood is kind of the go to service for millenials like myself because of commision-free trades. This Chase service gives me 100 commision free trades for my first year then increases to something like $2.95 per trade. Anyway I put in $1500 and am up $85 so far with these positions. I have a decently high risk tolerance as you'll see from some of these positions but am also interested in a few safer, dividend paying stocks I can hold forever.\n\n1 share SPY (up 3.7%), 15 shares CRON (up 24%), BRK.B 1 (up 2.8%), AAPL 1 (down 5.5%), CMI 1 (up 12.8%), V 1 (up 1.1%), GE 10 shares (up 16.5%), VNQ 1 share (up 0.65%), TGT 1 (up 9%), SCHA 1 (up 1.85%), CSCO 1 (up 2.41%), F 5 ( up 9.44%), SHLDQ 50...hoping their rescue from bankruptcy will put them closer to a the $1 mark, bought in at 0.76/share.. (down 25%), APRN 10 shares (up 20%), ARTX and CPST bought 1 share each just to get rid of all of my left over cash up 2% and 10% respectively.\n\nAnother question I had is if you would consider selling off my shares that are doing exceptionally well like CMI and TGT? I think both of these firms are obviously going to be around but they've gone up so much quicker than I anticipated that I'm wondering if I would be smart to lock in the gains now?", "score": 3, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 92, "submission_ratio": 0.03260869565217391, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread December 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

I'm a 28 year old college grad, about 2.5 years into my career. Target retirement date is 2055. I get paid on a semi-monthly basis (24 pay periods per year) and contribute to various accounts on a per-check basis. Note, the percentage next to each category represents the percent of total net worth in that account. The percentages within each category represent the percent of that account's funds which are allocated to that specific holding.\n\nNote that I follow the standard 50/30/20 rule, but my pyramid is all wonky; 30% of my income goes to expenses, 20% goes to discretionary spending, and 50% goes into savings/investing. I'm single (maritally) and have minimized my expenses as much as possible; I spend basically zero discretionary aside from gas and groceries. Took me a while to graduate so now my main focus is on building my savings and investments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStock Portfolio - 10% of total\n\nMGK - 23% (17%)\n\nVIOG - 20% (17%)\n\nVOT - 13% (17%)\n\nVNQ - 11% (17%)\n\nVEU - 10% (17%)\n\nFSTA - 10% (8%)\n\nVPU - 12% (8%)\n\nI buy and hold my stocks through TD Ameritrade so commission fees are a concern. My current strategy requires contributing a fixed amount per check into a specific savings account. The balance is then transferred to my stock portfolio quarterly to be invested. I buy into three of the holdings every quarter to facilitate rebalancing and minimize the impact of comission fees (currently approx 2.3% of my purchase price is commission with an additional fee incurred if I ever sell; dividends on my holdings are usually enough to cover fees).  First percentage in each holding is my current allocation. Second percentage in parentheses are target allocations. These get re-balanced quarterly since I contribute to three holdings per quarter (E.G. at the end of March/beginning of April I will be buying more shares of VOT, VNQ, and VEU to bring everything closer to the target). Current strategy is to buy and hold. I do not sell off of this count unless I absolutely have to (I try to keep enough of my total net worth in cash to avoid selling off any other holdings during emergencies). This account is under-weight. I contributed a bit after graduating from school but have not contributed regularly until the end of Q3 18. Total allocation to this account will increase over the next several quarters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n401k - 25% of total\n\nVFINX 35%\n\nVDIGX 35%\n\nVFFVX 30%\n\n401k receives contributions on a consistant per-check basis of 10% of my pre-tax income. Employer matches up to $4,000/yr. At my current employment status they are only matching 66% of my contributions up to the $4k but my 2018 contributions were high enough that I should still get the full $4k (provided my 'back-of-napkin' math is correct).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHSA - Essentially nothing\n\nMy employer now offers a pre-tax HSA healthcare plan which I just enrolled in at the end of 2018. They kick in $1,000/yr and I contribute $100 per check. This puts me just shy of the federal maximum individual yearly HSA contribution limit of $3,500. Current value is only $100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoth IRA - 40% of total\n\nThis is what is left of my college fund after graduation. I currently do not contribute to this account, as it is overweight against the rest of my portfolio. Once I reach the 100% match on my 401k (need to be employed for 3 years) and can hit the $4k employer match with a smaller personal contribution I will begin contributing to this IRA as well. Note that this account is managed by my family's financial planner so this is a 100% hands-off account. I don't have the exact holdings in front of me but I believe they're approx 60% US equities, 10% international equities, 15% fixed income, 15% cash/cash sweep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCash/Cash Equivalent - 20% of total\n\nCurrently, cash and savings accounts get the biggest per-check contribution, as I am currently saving for a house. I currently save approx 35% of my post-tax income in cash holdings, however this is largely to save for a down payment. My regular cash contribution strategy is closer to 20% of my post-tax income but since I'm saving for a house all of my excess cash goes here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPMs - 5% of total\n\nSilver is pretty and I like holding it so I buy it sometimes. This is not built into my savings budget, but rather I tend to buy a couple ounces per check out of my 'discretionary' budget. This is one of my strategies for increasing my savings/holdings by utilizing 'excess fat' in my discretionary budget (which also includes saving pocket change, stashing a $20 or two in a shoebox every check, etc).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll feedback and questions welcome.

It is also a dividend-paying stock, and is also a mid-cap stock that generates most of its earnings from the U.S market, hence signifying that it has little exposure to the U.S-China trade war. Though, I am still unsure about the size of the market that it is in and if it has greater growth potential than some of my other positions. \n\nMCD (20%)\u2014The numbers on this one are not as good. If I were to develop a position in this stock, I would be paying more than 2x growth, it has an ROE of less than -100%, EPS growth has been weak, though, its profit margins are impeccable and it has a D/E of near 0. It also has curtailed exposure to the languishing economic growth, and given the fact that demand for inferior goods would rise during a recession and how it has lesser exposure to the trade war and the current turmoil in EMs, I believe that developing a position in this dividend-paying (yet ridiculous and in some ways, overvalued stock) would give me some positive upside to a potential recession and a trade war. \n\nMSFT (10%)\u2014I see this stock as a means for procuring exposure to the cloud space. With cloud companies, I do not care for profitability nor for debt levels, as I believe that for a cloud bet to be profitable, the stock must have high retained earnings (which MSFT has) to be able to scale and acquire market share, and when it has developed a dominance in this very competitive market, the company\u2019s FCFE will become a non-issue at that point. Its PEG is decent, and it has 13.8% market share, with market share growth of over 98%. Though, Amazon is the dominant player in this space (with over 50% market share), but its market share growth is only about 9%. However, I am looking more so for a pure cloud play. \n\nRTN (10%)\u2014Due to the recent surge in defence spending under the current U.S administration and the fact that Raytheon, out of all the other U.S defence contractors, generates the largest portion of its revenue from defence contracts (roughly 94%), and with a PEG of 0.68 and above industry average ROE, and seeing as how tensions in the Middle East and North Korea are on the rise and NK still investing in its nuclear weapons program, I do think that Raytheon will rise dramatically. EPS growth in the next 5 years also seems to be impeccable. With that being said, the D/E of 0.45 is verging somewhat on the high side.\n \nAAPL (10%)\u2014Apple\u2019s fundamentals (for the most part) seem to be robust. The iPhone which comprises 62% of Apple\u2019s sales is expected to only grow at 0 to 5% in coming years, and Apple deciding no longer to reveal the ASP of their iPhones is also worrisome. Languishing demand in China, the largest market for iPhones, will also pose an issue. The PEG is decent, and Apple does pay a dividend, and an ROE of 48.7% and stellar EPS growth in the past is also commendable. However, the D/E of >1 is quite troublesome. Though, I think that the service business will be the most promising (expected to grow at 15%). In fact, just this quarter, Apple\u2019s services brought in $9.2 billion, beating estimates of $8.5 billion. In addition, the buybacks alone are expected to result in an increase of 4% this year in the stock price (they are expected to hit $50 billion), 3% the next, and 5% in 2020. I also believe in the underlying philosophy of their products (making devices thinner, lighter, and more minimalistic and hence, complying by the long-term trend of portability over performance and alleviating what I believe is the sort of tech aspect of their products which is simply a source of distraction and confusion) and their business model (committing their operational and strategic focus towards neglected segments of the market as they had done with the iPhone, that have huge growth potential, and not just appeasing short-term market interest as a means of milking the profitability of a single product line). I also believe that Apple has tremendous potential in healthcare and autonomous vehicles, which are both trillion dollar markets.  \n\nGLDM (10%)\u2014This is mainly to hedge against risk. The ETF also has a very low expense ratio. \n\nGS (20%)\u2014My only objection to this stock is the potential negative implications of the recent 1MDB scandal (and the D/E of 7.08 doesn\u2019t help. The stock has been downgraded heavily, though, the fundamentals (for the most part) are quite robust; it\u2019s operating margin is stellar, EPS growth in the past, and the PEG have been terrific (0.29). Moreover, GS has also been conducting \u201cfront to back\u201d sort of audits of its various divisions, and has been expanding to regional M&A markets that have combined deal values of billions of dollars and those are also places where JPM saw a 3 fold increase in its revenue from M&A activities. \n\nWill these positions deliver a higher alpha than the oracle of Omaha himself, or would I be better off investing in Pershing Square?", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 92, "submission_ratio": 0.010869565217391304, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread December 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

I have also long been holding a pool of ETFs, MFs and REIT's, but I've started to reach a point where my individually held stock portfolio approximates diversified US blue chips, with easily determined dividend performance. Not as diversified or properly weighted as my goals but returns on it have been quite satisfactory relative to major indices.\n\nI'm a US based investor in my mid-30s, with an eye towards FIRE. I was very fortunate to season my investing awareness during the lead up to the dot-com crash, and to be able to dollar cost average major positions of my portfolio in aftermath of the 2008 crash. Psychologically, I prefer to buy and hold for long term positions, making ~5-1 ratio of buy vs sell orders. I generally only sell portions to harvest gains to from my best performers stocks for rebalancing or to harvest losses/free up capital on severe underperformers. \n\nI am fairly risk averse, such that I don't want to be reliant on selling off slices of capital, with the hope that market growth exceeds my basic costs of living when I am retired. I have greater confidence with dividends in this regard, but would be fine with eventually realizing some gains to help fund discretionary expenditures.\n\n**What do I want to have in my portfolio? Two forks:**\n* Workhorses- Steady dividend performers with some growth. I have been allocating with a goal of matching my yearly expenses on products/services I get from that industry(e.g. ATT or TMUS would be candidates to help cover recurring cell phone service fees). The core idea is to hedge for price growth/inflation associated with a particular industry, and gradually build up confidence that my portfolio can consistently support a FIRE lifestyle with a healthy margin of error, regardless of the mood of Mr. Market. The pattern is not a hard and fast scheme, some industries such as utilities are overweighted relative to expenses(with proceeds going to categories such as taxes), while others such as hospitality I have not been finding too many good options so far. In any case, the thing to understand is I use a spreadsheet which I use to associate streams of dividend income to predictable clusters of my living costs, which I've found really good to tie things together in terms of \"how much is enough\". Dividend stocks I prefer tend to be at a below average PE of say 14-16, with a yield of ~1.5% or more.\n* Showhorses - Strong growth stocks with outsized impact and expectations in our present and future world. I fluctuate on my level of FOMO, but about 20-30 percent of my holdings can be bucketed here. I usually try to pick up stocks from this category on bad news when I feel the market over-corrects - FB and AAPL were fall season additions to the bucket.\n\n**What has been going well?**\n* I got a few growth equities \"on sale\" during our recent dips, with money I have been added to my accounts. Portfolio declined less than major markets.\n* Diversification helps moderate out the unfortunate picks(GE and BAYER come to mind for the current market cycle).\n\n**Observations:**\n* Knowledge & decision challenges of direct investing on a broad range of stocks- Investing directly in a diversified set of stocks really challenges you to do sufficient research and understand the forces affecting each additional company. When I started, it was easier to focus on industries I had more first-hand knowledge of. The process is forcing me to broaden my horizons as an investor, and be more systematic about my decisions.\n* Business Cycle seasonality & Trends - I am not a market timer for moving in/out, but some industries have major seasonality, for which some stocks will just stay down for good reasons. I need read up and build up a stronger knowledge base on business cycles to help prioritize where to focus new investments.\n\n**What am planning to change:**\n* International Exposure: Only 8% of my portfolio is internationally diversified outside of US. Broker transaction fees, mediocre performance, overseas taxes and high mgmt fees on int'l funds have historically kept me limited here. Given that US growth could be more volatile in coming years, I'd like to increase to about 12-15% this year, with about 10-15 new positions. I've been starting to plan out some higher expense mutual funds I will tap, to start up an account with Interactive brokers. Some initial forays into foreign stocks I made with funds in a retirement account was a boneheaded mistake, due to  sub-optimal tax treatment on the dividends, but it was a lesson learned, as a mistake \"in the small\".\n* Food, travel/hospitality and health/biotech are three areas I am comparatively under-exposed on. I'll be hunting for good performers at reasonable prices in next couple years.

Two forks:**\n* Workhorses- Steady dividend performers with some growth. I have been allocating with a goal of matching my yearly expenses on products/services I get from that industry(e.g. ATT or TMUS would be candidates to help cover recurring cell phone service fees). The core idea is to hedge for price growth/inflation associated with a particular industry, and gradually build up confidence that my portfolio can consistently support a FIRE lifestyle with a healthy margin of error, regardless of the mood of Mr. Market. The pattern is not a hard and fast scheme, some industries such as utilities are overweighted relative to expenses(with proceeds going to categories such as taxes), while others such as hospitality I have not been finding too many good options so far. In any case, the thing to understand is I use a spreadsheet which I use to associate streams of dividend income to predictable clusters of my living costs, which I've found really good to tie things together in terms of \"how much is enough\". Dividend stocks I prefer tend to be at a below average PE of say 14-16, with a yield of ~1.5% or more.\n* Showhorses - Strong growth stocks with outsized impact and expectations in our present and future world.

I need read up and build up a stronger knowledge base on business cycles to help prioritize where to focus new investments.\n\n**What am planning to change:**\n* International Exposure: Only 8% of my portfolio is internationally diversified outside of US. Broker transaction fees, mediocre performance, overseas taxes and high mgmt fees on int'l funds have historically kept me limited here. Given that US growth could be more volatile in coming years, I'd like to increase to about 12-15% this year, with about 10-15 new positions. I've been starting to plan out some higher expense mutual funds I will tap, to start up an account with Interactive brokers.

I have also long been holding a pool of ETFs, MFs and REIT's, but I've started to reach a point where my individually held stock portfolio approximates diversified US blue chips, with easily determined dividend performance. Not as diversified or properly weighted as my goals but returns on it have been quite satisfactory relative to major indices.\n\nI'm a US based investor in my mid-30s, with an eye towards FIRE. I was very fortunate to season my investing awareness during the lead up to the dot-com crash, and to be able to dollar cost average major positions of my portfolio in aftermath of the 2008 crash. Psychologically, I prefer to buy and hold for long term positions, making ~5-1 ratio of buy vs sell orders. I generally only sell portions to harvest gains to from my best performers stocks for rebalancing or to harvest losses/free up capital on severe underperformers. \n\nI am fairly risk averse, such that I don't want to be reliant on selling off slices of capital, with the hope that market growth exceeds my basic costs of living when I am retired. I have greater confidence with dividends in this regard, but would be fine with eventually realizing some gains to help fund discretionary expenditures.\n\n**What do I want to have in my portfolio? Two forks:**\n* Workhorses- Steady dividend performers with some growth. I have been allocating with a goal of matching my yearly expenses on products/services I get from that industry(e.g. ATT or TMUS would be candidates to help cover recurring cell phone service fees). The core idea is to hedge for price growth/inflation associated with a particular industry, and gradually build up confidence that my portfolio can consistently support a FIRE lifestyle with a healthy margin of error, regardless of the mood of Mr. Market. The pattern is not a hard and fast scheme, some industries such as utilities are overweighted relative to expenses(with proceeds going to categories such as taxes), while others such as hospitality I have not been finding too many good options so far. In any case, the thing to understand is I use a spreadsheet which I use to associate streams of dividend income to predictable clusters of my living costs, which I've found really good to tie things together in terms of \"how much is enough\". Dividend stocks I prefer tend to be at a below average PE of say 14-16, with a yield of ~1.5% or more.\n* Showhorses - Strong growth stocks with outsized impact and expectations in our present and future world. I fluctuate on my level of FOMO, but about 20-30 percent of my holdings can be bucketed here. I usually try to pick up stocks from this category on bad news when I feel the market over-corrects - FB and AAPL were fall season additions to the bucket.\n\n**What has been going well?**\n* I got a few growth equities \"on sale\" during our recent dips, with money I have been added to my accounts. Portfolio declined less than major markets.\n* Diversification helps moderate out the unfortunate picks(GE and BAYER come to mind for the current market cycle).\n\n**Observations:**\n* Knowledge & decision challenges of direct investing on a broad range of stocks- Investing directly in a diversified set of stocks really challenges you to do sufficient research and understand the forces affecting each additional company. When I started, it was easier to focus on industries I had more first-hand knowledge of. The process is forcing me to broaden my horizons as an investor, and be more systematic about my decisions.\n* Business Cycle seasonality & Trends - I am not a market timer for moving in/out, but some industries have major seasonality, for which some stocks will just stay down for good reasons. I need read up and build up a stronger knowledge base on business cycles to help prioritize where to focus new investments.\n\n**What am planning to change:**\n* International Exposure: Only 8% of my portfolio is internationally diversified outside of US. Broker transaction fees, mediocre performance, overseas taxes and high mgmt fees on int'l funds have historically kept me limited here. Given that US growth could be more volatile in coming years, I'd like to increase to about 12-15% this year, with about 10-15 new positions. I've been starting to plan out some higher expense mutual funds I will tap, to start up an account with Interactive brokers. Some initial forays into foreign stocks I made with funds in a retirement account was a boneheaded mistake, due to  sub-optimal tax treatment on the dividends, but it was a lesson learned, as a mistake \"in the small\".\n* Food, travel/hospitality and health/biotech are three areas I am comparatively under-exposed on. I'll be hunting for good performers at reasonable prices in next couple years. (Suggestions on these fronts would be welcome)\n\n**What tools do I use?**\n* Sigfig - Helps me detailed Portfolio analysis/review.\n* Personal Capital - Day to day tracking.\n* Reuters - Sober business news.\n* The Economist - Provides a dose of analysis with a bit more reflection than the daily news cycle.\n\n\n**Below is the portfolio:**\n\nTICKER|DIV.

You chose some great strong blue-chip names:\n\nUNH is nice because it is a consumer staple (everyone needs healthcare, and it's a dominant player) and will likely be a little more defensive.\n\nAdobe is tied to tech but has several moats\n\nMastercard is tied to fin-tech (and consumer credit card debt)\n\nSPYG is a nice low fee growth based index fund / etf. which adds some diversity with more growth companies with rising earnings / forecast to make more money.\n\nOk let's look at my concerns:\n\n1. **Overweight in Individual Stocks:** You have four individual stocks making up 84% of your portfolio.  If you want to reduce some risk and increase your diversity - I would limit your individual holdings to 3-5% each, no more than 10%.  But maybe you invested a smaller $$$ amount and want all of this risk.\n\n2. **Growth Names:** All of these are high flying companies that have done extremely well over the past few years.  If you invested in them years ago, you'd be doing incredible.  What happens when the market falls?  All of the companies that rose very fast then fall even faster.\n\n3. **Tech Sector:** All of these barring UNH are tied to tech directly or indirectly.  In the event of a sector based selloff, you are going to see extreme volatility and have to stomach large losses.\n\nAll in all, you mention your timeframe is 5+ years.  Keep investing, and when the market goes down, keep buying more.  I would look into finding some lower P:E ratio stocks or value funds, since in the long run - value beats growth and is more defensive in nature.  When we hit our next recession - that's when you'll want to shift back to growth.  \n\n", "score": 7, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 92, "submission_ratio": 0.07608695652173914, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread December 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

Let's start with the good!  You picked for the most part big blue chip companies that make money.  Even though you're way too overweight in tech, AAPL and MSFT are more fairly valued than a lot of others in the space.\n2. Ok moving forward.  You said \"I worked really hard for this money, and I want to see it grow\".  This leads me to believe that you are not comfortable taking so much risk.  Every single stock is high risk and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  How would you react to your portfolio dropping 20% in value?  How about 50%?\n3. You are far too overweight in cyclical sectors, and we are nearing the end of a booming economic cycle.  Growth numbers are slowing, and a recession is looming.  Do we know when?  No.  This is why timing the market is impossible.  Stocks could triple before they halve.  And when they drop, will you be able to time the bottom?  Nope.\n4. Some ways to reduce risk and volatility are to diversify your holdings across different sectors, find non-cyclical companies, or find alternative investment vehicles such as commodities or bonds.  I personally believe you should not have more than 5% in any individual holding, and no more than 20% in a given sector for equities.\n\nIn summation, you've got the right idea in that you should be putting your money to work.  I just don't think that your current strategy really aligns to the level of risk you're willing to take.\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 8, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 92, "submission_ratio": 0.08695652173913043, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread December 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

Just a bit about me before I give my advice to help gauge it's quality. I've been investing about 3 years started when I was 17 and I'm about to be 21 this year and have had good success overall in the markets. At the point of the market we are in which is essentially a continuation of the bull we have been in since 2009 (with a few minor dips of course) there are many companies that I feel (and many others feel) are essentially at near peek valuation. Now don't get me wrong all the companies you've listed have all very high growth potential but I would make sure and be diligent about ensuring you are getting a good deal. When stock market sentiment is high we often see an inflation in large cap businesses that may be unwarranted and maybe  some of the ones you have listed here are a part of it. Companies like NKE for example have relatively high P/E ratios compared to others in the sector, of course some of this is justified being that it is Nike after all but due to the volatility of the markets a better buy opportunity might present itself a bit later on after the new fiscal year hype dicipates. I would make sure that each investment pays good dividends NIKE at the moment has just over a 1% ADY so you're essentially betting on capital appreciation. I would calculate intrinsic value for all these companies to ensure the equity is there and they're not severely overvalued maybe diversify into a bit of midcap exposure that pays a good dividend (there may be good opportunity in small and mid) and ensure you are confident about entry price there may be better entry price on these stocks coming in a bit and entering a bit later might prove to be a a profitable play. Overall use say if you have a medium to long time horizon between 5-10 or 10-20 years these will prove to be profitable! Always keep looking for opportunity in other sectors of course I think with the new electric car wave energy and specifically anything affiliated with battery and semiconductor production are currently good value and may be a good speculative long position in your portfolio we are in the beginning stages of course.

I'm a 28 year old college grad, about 2.5 years into my career. Target retirement date is 2055. I get paid on a semi-monthly basis (24 pay periods per year) and contribute to various accounts on a per-check basis. Note, the percentage next to each category represents the percent of total net worth in that account. The percentages within each category represent the percent of that account's funds which are allocated to that specific holding.\n\nNote that I follow the standard 50/30/20 rule, but my pyramid is all wonky; 30% of my income goes to expenses, 20% goes to discretionary spending, and 50% goes into savings/investing. I'm single (maritally) and have minimized my expenses as much as possible; I spend basically zero discretionary aside from gas and groceries. Took me a while to graduate so now my main focus is on building my savings and investments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStock Portfolio - 10% of total\n\nMGK - 23% (17%)\n\nVIOG - 20% (17%)\n\nVOT - 13% (17%)\n\nVNQ - 11% (17%)\n\nVEU - 10% (17%)\n\nFSTA - 10% (8%)\n\nVPU - 12% (8%)\n\nI buy and hold my stocks through TD Ameritrade so commission fees are a concern. My current strategy requires contributing a fixed amount per check into a specific savings account. The balance is then transferred to my stock portfolio quarterly to be invested. I buy into three of the holdings every quarter to facilitate rebalancing and minimize the impact of comission fees (currently approx 2.3% of my purchase price is commission with an additional fee incurred if I ever sell; dividends on my holdings are usually enough to cover fees).  First percentage in each holding is my current allocation. Second percentage in parentheses are target allocations. These get re-balanced quarterly since I contribute to three holdings per quarter (E.G. at the end of March/beginning of April I will be buying more shares of VOT, VNQ, and VEU to bring everything closer to the target). Current strategy is to buy and hold. I do not sell off of this count unless I absolutely have to (I try to keep enough of my total net worth in cash to avoid selling off any other holdings during emergencies). This account is under-weight. I contributed a bit after graduating from school but have not contributed regularly until the end of Q3 18. Total allocation to this account will increase over the next several quarters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n401k - 25% of total\n\nVFINX 35%\n\nVDIGX 35%\n\nVFFVX 30%\n\n401k receives contributions on a consistant per-check basis of 10% of my pre-tax income. Employer matches up to $4,000/yr. At my current employment status they are only matching 66% of my contributions up to the $4k but my 2018 contributions were high enough that I should still get the full $4k (provided my 'back-of-napkin' math is correct).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHSA - Essentially nothing\n\nMy employer now offers a pre-tax HSA healthcare plan which I just enrolled in at the end of 2018. They kick in $1,000/yr and I contribute $100 per check. This puts me just shy of the federal maximum individual yearly HSA contribution limit of $3,500. Current value is only $100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoth IRA - 40% of total\n\nThis is what is left of my college fund after graduation. I currently do not contribute to this account, as it is overweight against the rest of my portfolio. Once I reach the 100% match on my 401k (need to be employed for 3 years) and can hit the $4k employer match with a smaller personal contribution I will begin contributing to this IRA as well. Note that this account is managed by my family's financial planner so this is a 100% hands-off account. I don't have the exact holdings in front of me but I believe they're approx 60% US equities, 10% international equities, 15% fixed income, 15% cash/cash sweep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCash/Cash Equivalent - 20% of total\n\nCurrently, cash and savings accounts get the biggest per-check contribution, as I am currently saving for a house. I currently save approx 35% of my post-tax income in cash holdings, however this is largely to save for a down payment. My regular cash contribution strategy is closer to 20% of my post-tax income but since I'm saving for a house all of my excess cash goes here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPMs - 5% of total\n\nSilver is pretty and I like holding it so I buy it sometimes. This is not built into my savings budget, but rather I tend to buy a couple ounces per check out of my 'discretionary' budget. This is one of my strategies for increasing my savings/holdings by utilizing 'excess fat' in my discretionary budget (which also includes saving pocket change, stashing a $20 or two in a shoebox every check, etc).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll feedback and questions welcome.

I cannot expect to be able routinely monitor major activities for all thoe companies I hold, but that is not a pre-requisite for achieving my investing goals. I am no Warren Buffet, and my approach acknowledges that reality. I do analyse on cases where companies falter on metrics which matter to me, or show up in the news.\n\nFrom my POV, O'Neill and other active investors/arbitrageurs core thesis is that they are significantly more intelligent, and have a better system than the market at large for recognizing outstanding trades and will be able to outperform it to a sizable degree, at least under a familiar set of market conditions. The risk they see with their polar opposite(diversification) is that an investor will miss out on the big wins of hand picked gems of trades, and risk middling performance, which is completely accurate.\n\nI had a hard time finding clean long-haul data to reflect the performance of that system. My concern is that simple systems are easily copied, and most investors do not have the diligence to do the detailed ben graham analysis for laser focused picks with extreme levels of certainty to the outcomes. Also, one might loose more sleep when a stock covering 30% of your portfolio has a bad day- that isn't to be trivialized.\n\nOn the other extreme, are proponents of diversification through indices such as Jack Bogle. The risk this school counters are that the market has many traps for unsophisticated investors to be separated from chunks of their modest savings through direct engagements or schemes. Many investors are less rational/more emotional, various fees/hidden costs can eat sizable bits and luck/unpredictability plays a larger role in market successes than some might want to admit(the news has a bias to focus on the big winners). Folks who go diversifiction can expect their investments to healthily grow, but definitely won't be able to go from middle class to the hamptons or the riviera on their gains.\n\nIf I had to choose from one of those absolutes, it would be diversification. Fortunately I don't have to. My approach is reasonably competent stock picking/price selection to buy good companies, on average targeting at below market prices, and largely holding, while progressively experimenting with strategies to modestly enhance returns, such as writing small covered calls on my largest holdings needing rebalancing.\n\nThe concentration of my approach has gradually shifted from admittedly mediocre/suboptimal picks of mutual funds towards index funds increasingly to direct positions, with picks motivated as discussed in original post.\n\nWhat do I get vs alternatives?\n * I know how much dividends to expect each year with good confidence from data on each company, and healthy expectation of slow, steady growth in those dividends. This is huge for me in a world where defined benefit pensions aren't a thing. Dividends are riskier with picks, and obfuscated when relying on funds.\n * I can choose what *isn't* in my portfolio & avoid false diversification arising from the same successful stocks being present in many funds. \n * My upkeep fees are lower than index funds or mutual funds.\n * I can focus on refining my approach through decision volume on a process for making competent buy/sell calls at good prices, rather than stress to make sure say 80% of cases successfully go up 50% in two years or yield 6% in a month.", "score": 7, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 92, "submission_ratio": 0.07608695652173914, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread December 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

You chose some great strong blue-chip names:\n\nUNH is nice because it is a consumer staple (everyone needs healthcare, and it's a dominant player) and will likely be a little more defensive.\n\nAdobe is tied to tech but has several moats\n\nMastercard is tied to fin-tech (and consumer credit card debt)\n\nSPYG is a nice low fee growth based index fund / etf. which adds some diversity with more growth companies with rising earnings / forecast to make more money.\n\nOk let's look at my concerns:\n\n1. **Overweight in Individual Stocks:** You have four individual stocks making up 84% of your portfolio.  If you want to reduce some risk and increase your diversity - I would limit your individual holdings to 3-5% each, no more than 10%.  But maybe you invested a smaller $$$ amount and want all of this risk.\n\n2. **Growth Names:** All of these are high flying companies that have done extremely well over the past few years.  If you invested in them years ago, you'd be doing incredible.  What happens when the market falls?  All of the companies that rose very fast then fall even faster.\n\n3. **Tech Sector:** All of these barring UNH are tied to tech directly or indirectly.  In the event of a sector based selloff, you are going to see extreme volatility and have to stomach large losses.\n\nAll in all, you mention your timeframe is 5+ years.  Keep investing, and when the market goes down, keep buying more.  I would look into finding some lower P:E ratio stocks or value funds, since in the long run - value beats growth and is more defensive in nature.  When we hit our next recession - that's when you'll want to shift back to growth.  \n\n", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.14285714285714285}, {"time": 1545446217.0, "submission_id": "a239zd", "comment_id": "ecal1d2", "body": "Hey just hit under $30 today ", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 92, "submission_ratio": 0.021739130434782608, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread December 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

Let's start with the good!  You picked for the most part big blue chip companies that make money.  Even though you're way too overweight in tech, AAPL and MSFT are more fairly valued than a lot of others in the space.\n2. Ok moving forward.  You said \"I worked really hard for this money, and I want to see it grow\".  This leads me to believe that you are not comfortable taking so much risk.  Every single stock is high risk and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  How would you react to your portfolio dropping 20% in value?  How about 50%?\n3. You are far too overweight in cyclical sectors, and we are nearing the end of a booming economic cycle.  Growth numbers are slowing, and a recession is looming.  Do we know when?  No.  This is why timing the market is impossible.  Stocks could triple before they halve.  And when they drop, will you be able to time the bottom?  Nope.\n4. Some ways to reduce risk and volatility are to diversify your holdings across different sectors, find non-cyclical companies, or find alternative investment vehicles such as commodities or bonds.  I personally believe you should not have more than 5% in any individual holding, and no more than 20% in a given sector for equities.\n\nIn summation, you've got the right idea in that you should be putting your money to work.  I just don't think that your current strategy really aligns to the level of risk you're willing to take.\n\n\n\n\n", "parent_score": 8, "parent_ratio": 0.25}, {"time": 1550029788.0, "submission_id": "a239zd", "comment_id": "egcxvoc", "body": "With every update Snapchat users keep saying that the app keeps getting worse.

Sometimes they even double dip these expense ratios since they just contain other funds inside them.\n\nTLDR: If you aren't touching the money for 10+ years - go heavy into low cost index fund equities.

I cannot expect to be able routinely monitor major activities for all thoe companies I hold, but that is not a pre-requisite for achieving my investing goals. I am no Warren Buffet, and my approach acknowledges that reality. I do analyse on cases where companies falter on metrics which matter to me, or show up in the news.\n\nFrom my POV, O'Neill and other active investors/arbitrageurs core thesis is that they are significantly more intelligent, and have a better system than the market at large for recognizing outstanding trades and will be able to outperform it to a sizable degree, at least under a familiar set of market conditions. The risk they see with their polar opposite(diversification) is that an investor will miss out on the big wins of hand picked gems of trades, and risk middling performance, which is completely accurate.\n\nI had a hard time finding clean long-haul data to reflect the performance of that system. My concern is that simple systems are easily copied, and most investors do not have the diligence to do the detailed ben graham analysis for laser focused picks with extreme levels of certainty to the outcomes. Also, one might loose more sleep when a stock covering 30% of your portfolio has a bad day- that isn't to be trivialized.\n\nOn the other extreme, are proponents of diversification through indices such as Jack Bogle. The risk this school counters are that the market has many traps for unsophisticated investors to be separated from chunks of their modest savings through direct engagements or schemes. Many investors are less rational/more emotional, various fees/hidden costs can eat sizable bits and luck/unpredictability plays a larger role in market successes than some might want to admit(the news has a bias to focus on the big winners). Folks who go diversifiction can expect their investments to healthily grow, but definitely won't be able to go from middle class to the hamptons or the riviera on their gains.\n\nIf I had to choose from one of those absolutes, it would be diversification. Fortunately I don't have to. My approach is reasonably competent stock picking/price selection to buy good companies, on average targeting at below market prices, and largely holding, while progressively experimenting with strategies to modestly enhance returns, such as writing small covered calls on my largest holdings needing rebalancing.\n\nThe concentration of my approach has gradually shifted from admittedly mediocre/suboptimal picks of mutual funds towards index funds increasingly to direct positions, with picks motivated as discussed in original post.\n\nWhat do I get vs alternatives?\n * I know how much dividends to expect each year with good confidence from data on each company, and healthy expectation of slow, steady growth in those dividends. This is huge for me in a world where defined benefit pensions aren't a thing. Dividends are riskier with picks, and obfuscated when relying on funds.\n * I can choose what *isn't* in my portfolio & avoid false diversification arising from the same successful stocks being present in many funds. \n * My upkeep fees are lower than index funds or mutual funds.\n * I can focus on refining my approach through decision volume on a process for making competent buy/sell calls at good prices, rather than stress to make sure say 80% of cases successfully go up 50% in two years or yield 6% in a month.", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.2857142857142857}, {"time": 1544455996.0, "submission_id": "a239zd", "comment_id": "ebi0dtt", "body": "You got very small amount of GE 0.28% its tiny ofcourse GE gone turn around after dividend cut ge gone get every 3 months extra $975 000 to sort out things in your place i would average ge down and would buy more if you hold for long time.

I don't tend to punish individual stocks I hold for present or anticipated macro-economic conditions.\n * Global diversification is a major theme for me in coming year/years, as I try to pull in businesses from around the world with solid prospects.
