I've heard a lot of worries about the trade war in the short-term and there's no shortage of 2019 bears. Secondly, looking at CAT's conference call, their growth was fueled by Chinese sales. It says on the presentation their construction industry in China had the largest increase in demand among their other markets. CAT doesn't say exactly what percentage of their profit comes from Chinese markets, but in multiple points they mention Chinese construction and industry as a significant portion of the reason they beat earnings. If China enters an economic downturn due to the trade war, (some say it's already showing signs of weakening), then the international construction equipment sellers lose a big chunk of business.
