Community college will teach you the fun stuff, how to *use* software programs like Visual Studio to create applications with C#, Python, and other languages. Universities will teach you the theory part of it, which is both useful and not. These classes will teach you how to solve a problem in the most efficient way possible based on how computers make sense of information. You won't be able to use theory to create applications, however. Many workplaces will expect a lot of hands-on time with what their shop uses. So while you might understand how to solve their business problem, you wouldn't necessarily be able to implement a solution.\n\nGoing to community college first will also give you a decent toe-dipping test to see if you like the industry. If you don't like creating applications, you likely won't like most tech jobs. If you're more of a networker, you'll have a job for awhile. I'd advise you go more towards IPv6 and understanding that more fully than IPv4, and consistently push for it wherever you go.

It was a mix of luck and ability. I spent my time getting AAS degrees, and managed to receive a paid internship with a federal contractor on the East coast that also earned bachelor degree credits. Once the internship was done, they decided to hire me part time while I go to college full time. When Spring rolls around, I'll be back on the East coast doing another paid CS internship for credits. \n\nI would suggest follow a path like mine. Community college will teach you the fun stuff, how to *use* software programs like Visual Studio to create applications with C#, Python, and other languages. Universities will teach you the theory part of it, which is both useful and not. These classes will teach you how to solve a problem in the most efficient way possible based on how computers make sense of information. You won't be able to use theory to create applications, however. Many workplaces will expect a lot of hands-on time with what their shop uses. So while you might understand how to solve their business problem, you wouldn't necessarily be able to implement a solution.\n\nGoing to community college first will also give you a decent toe-dipping test to see if you like the industry. If you don't like creating applications, you likely won't like most tech jobs. If you're more of a networker, you'll have a job for awhile. I'd advise you go more towards IPv6 and understanding that more fully than IPv4, and consistently push for it wherever you go.

Vanguard isn\u2019t the flashiest of brokers and its website/app is fairly outdated and simple. You\u2019re not going have access to graphs, charts, breaking news, dozens of different metrics, and pretty colors. Instead, you get the simple basics but the info you need when buying/selling a stock is all there. Another flaw with vanguard is commission fees can be fairly high or at least higher than what other brokers charge today when buying/selling shares. If you stick with index funds it doesn\u2019t matter much but for trading individual stocks it can suck paying $7 a transaction. The site/app occasionally runs slow or goes down for maintenance for a little every few months but I\u2019ve never seen anyone lose their money or have the system seriously screw or fail them. \n\nMy only bad experience was that I did (along with many others) experience a glitch a few months back that basically said everyone had insufficient funds and their holdings could be sold off to cover differences but was told after calling it was a fake warning that hit everyone and wouldn\u2019t affect anything or cause any sell off. Basically a glitch that issued a fake warning message to everyone. Honestly I can\u2019t even call it a bad experience, more just a quick scare. Their support has always been super nice and helpful in the few times I\u2019ve had to call them.\n\nSome pros with vanguard are their great selection of index funds that often come with some of the lowest expense ratios on the market (although other brokers have become more competitive the last few years). Vanguard is also an older, reputable, and reliable broker so you know your money is safe. That may sound silly or obvious but I\u2019m amazed at some of sites and apps people find themselves on that are brutal fees or actually scams. They definitely cater to people with the mindsets of diversity and holding long term. \n\nVanguard used to have a significant edge in regards to fees and expense rates for their funds and commissions but the industry has become super competitive as of late. If I was new to investing and looking for a broker, I can\u2019t say with confidence I\u2019d pick Vanguard again.

Sectors like biotech, pharmaceuticals, and life sciences can be really complex and difficult to understand if you don\u2019t have much of a background, education, or experience in it. CRISPR technology/science is basically on a entirely different level. It\u2019s amazing stuff but something we\u2019re still very far away from truly understanding and mastering.\n\nIt\u2019s way out of my league in terms of understanding it but even if I did feel comfortable enough to invest in it, there are still a few concerns I have. The technology is still pretty early in its infancy and it will likely be years or even decades before we see full wide scale use of the technology. Despite the massive potential and promising aspects of it, it\u2019s also not a sure thing either and a pretty risky investment. There have also been concerns regarding the safety of it with some side effects appearing for the technology that, depending on who ask, range from fairly minimal to pretty alarming.\n\nOne thing I don\u2019t really get about people investing in this field is why not wait until things get a little more settled and concrete? This is a technology that is still really new and not totally understood yet. I understand wanting to get in before it gets big if it proves successful but by the time it eventually reaches that status (if it ever does) it may have been years and years where you were likely holding something that was pretty volatile and likely underperformed the market over a stretch of time. What if the field is successful but you held the wrong company? This isn\u2019t your typical biotech or pharmaceutical stock that is a few months or couple years away from FDA approval and wide use. Many of these products/companies haven\u2019t even reached trials or are in very early phases of trials and these trials can take a very long time. If you\u2019re going to invest, this is something you have to be very long term on or something you\u2019re going to play your luck on short term trading via news and progress of trials.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a field of science and not an actual company (unless you\u2019re talking about CRISPR Therapeutics specifically) you\u2019re also going to have to determine which company to invest in unless you want to go with an ETF that holds several companies in the field (I believe there actually is such an ETF IIRC). You\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re following the clinical trials of these companies, how they compare against their competitors, and can they survive while they develop this stuff via other product/service revenue sources, loans, grants, or donations. Perhaps most importantly, what do the patent situations looks like for these companies?\n\nIf you still have confidence in the field I think it\u2019s also important to figure out exactly what use the technology will have. Is it for treating people with medical conditions? Perhaps for animals/livestock? Is it going to be used for food/agricultural? All of the above or some other thing? CRISPR is sort of a broad term when discussing its applicable uses so it\u2019s important you determine what things it will be used for and how willing the sector/businesses/consumers will be towards accepting it.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to invest in the sector, just make sure you actually understand it from both a medical/science standpoint and an investing one. Make sure you understand it\u2019s likely a risky, volatile bet that could pay off huge if successful but has a lot of huddles to get over to get there. Sometimes people get caught up in trying to find the next big thing and wear rose tinted glasses. Flying cars, cures for cancer, asteroid mining, or whatever else it may be. Stuff that sounds amazing and promising on paper but that doesn\u2019t always actually make it off paper or out of the lab to the consumer or is still a very long time away from reaching them. Don\u2019t get too caught up on future promise/potential, look at it with a reasonable, realistic, and skeptical view.\n\nIt could be a great investment that pays off big time but for me personally it\u2019s just too complex, early on, and risky that it\u2019s not worth it. Maybe I\u2019ll think differently in time or maybe I\u2019ll miss the boat all together on it but I can\u2019t invest in something I don\u2019t feel comfortable, confident, or educated enough in.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 10, "submission_ratio": 0.1, "submission_title": "I was going to think to invest in CRISPR", "submission_text": "but  people  told to wait  cause  we are  not  at  point in which  the   tecnology is useful, and  many look  at me  as  it  said  somenthing   ridiculous  from an  investiment  point  of   wiev.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n*****\n> Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n*****\n> \"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports \u2014 primarily in agriculture and aircraft \u2014 and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,\" they wrote.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iaf0NzN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cbuqBSO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/u5gI6iH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rbQVQqe.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SzYiqA3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mdFuI9S.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5tQvUoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lKyFFgp.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/spvb4Xb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTyGhJe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HIe3JGx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Thanksgiving Market Returns\n\n> Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n*****\n> Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n*****\n> \"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports \u2014 primarily in agriculture and aircraft \u2014 and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,\" they wrote.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iaf0NzN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cbuqBSO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/u5gI6iH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rbQVQqe.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SzYiqA3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mdFuI9S.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5tQvUoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lKyFFgp.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/spvb4Xb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTyGhJe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HIe3JGx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Thanksgiving Market Returns\n\n> Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance.

Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n*****\n> Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n*****\n> \"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports \u2014 primarily in agriculture and aircraft \u2014 and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,\" they wrote.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iaf0NzN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cbuqBSO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/u5gI6iH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rbQVQqe.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SzYiqA3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mdFuI9S.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5tQvUoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lKyFFgp.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/spvb4Xb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTyGhJe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HIe3JGx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Thanksgiving Market Returns\n\n> Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n*****\n> Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n*****\n> \"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports \u2014 primarily in agriculture and aircraft \u2014 and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,\" they wrote.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iaf0NzN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cbuqBSO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/u5gI6iH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rbQVQqe.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SzYiqA3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mdFuI9S.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5tQvUoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lKyFFgp.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/spvb4Xb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTyGhJe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HIe3JGx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Thanksgiving Market Returns\n\n> Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n*****\n> Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n*****\n> \"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports \u2014 primarily in agriculture and aircraft \u2014 and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,\" they wrote.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iaf0NzN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cbuqBSO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/u5gI6iH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rbQVQqe.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SzYiqA3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mdFuI9S.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5tQvUoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lKyFFgp.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/spvb4Xb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTyGhJe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HIe3JGx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Thanksgiving Market Returns\n\n> Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n> Stocks closed with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n> \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n> More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n> Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n> \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n> Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n> Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n> \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n> Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n> Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance.

Since WWII, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n> On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n> As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n> After the least volatile third quarter for the S&P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n> \u201cLast year we saw the S&P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n> On a closing basis, the S&P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n> First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n> Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n> Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JD** \n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$BBY** \n> * **$LOW** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$TJX** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$LB** \n> * **$GWGH** \n> * **$DE** \n> * **$INTU** \n> * **$URBN** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$MDT** \n> * **$SPB** \n> * **$ADSK** \n> * **$CPB** \n> * **$PSTG** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$A** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$LEJU** \n> * **$JEC** \n> * **$SOL** \n> * **$JACK** \n> * **$HRL** \n> * **$BILI** \n> * **$FL** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$GHG \n> * **$BJ** \n> * **$BECN** \n> * **$QD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$DY** \n> * **$BRKS** \n> * **$NUAN** \n> * **$VBLT** \n> * **$SSI** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$SFL** \n> * **$NJR** \n> * **$MMS** \n> * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.
