But exiting bonds get a double wammy. Say you bought a 10 yr bond paying 2% last month you are locked in. Now you can get a bond paying 3%.  If you want to liquidate you need someone to take over that contract for the remainder of the 10 years.  Why would he do that when he can buy a new one paying 3%. so in order for you to sell it you need to make up the difference to 3% so you would have to sell it at a piece that effectively gives you a 1% return paying the difference from 2% to 3%.\n\nOr you could mean why are prices down.  if you By a 10 year bond with a face value of $1000. the price is inverse of the initial price. I'm not going to do the math but lets say its a 2% annual return then the price would be something like 850 so that after 10 years of compound interest you get to 1000.

Don't chase things up 10%.\n\nIt sucks to have a week like this, but you know what? It's okay. It's a learning experience and you're going to have those throughout your time investing, but especially early on.\n\nWhat I would suggest doing is this:\n\nTake the weekend, really look around at stocks and come up with a few names where you really have a strong thesis for the company for a few years out - by high quality names that you feel confident in. If you have a strong thesis in something and feel confident in it, you're not going to feel nearly like you do right now. If you invest in your best ideas, then you're going to want to add to them if the market is down a thousand points in a week. \n\nI'd look at names like Danaher (DHR), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), Heico (HEI.A or HEI, non-voting/voting), Liberty Formula One (FWONA)/Liberty Ventures (LVNTA), Microsoft (MSFT), Constellation (STZ, especially if it gets a bit lower), Visa/Mastercard (V/MA) Given that Apple has basically said that it will start putting a significant amount of the cash that it's been sitting on to work, that's interesting if it gets a bit lower next week. \n\nWhat else? Berkshire (although Buffett/Munger will probably not be running it for that many more years), Roper (ROP), Becton Dickinson (BDX), Vail (MTN, although that's a bit inconsistent and having a so-so year given lackluster snowfall), the exchanges (CME, CBOE, NDAQ, ICE), the cell tower REITs (CCI, AMT) the cell tower soon-to-be-a-REIT (SBA), pet health (IDXX, ZTS, although I'd wait for both to come down some more), car tech co Aptiv (APTV), rails (CNI, UNP, etc), banks (although I really only like JPM). Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM). Madison Square Garden (MSG) is a fun option. Riskier growth, as well - Tencent, JD, BABA (or BABA alternative AABA), Square, Shopify, Paypal. \n\nUltimately, you have to do the homework and come to your own conclusion on what to invest in but the above is just throwing out a lot of names to consider.\n\nThere's so many other great companies. And these can certainly go down too.\n\nHave your dividends set to reinvest; even if it's a small amount, it's still more shares being added on every time a dividend occurs.\n\nPersonally, I think what helps me a lot is that I don't invest in what I want to own tomorrow or next week, because I have no idea what things will do tomorrow or next week, I invest with a view towards what I would like to own 3-5 years out. If you focus entirely on what your investments do day-to-day, you're going to find investing is a very frustrating experience - but I think having significant confidence in your investments helps in trying to let your money work for you rather than constantly trying to look over your money's shoulder while it's trying to work for you.\n\nThe other thing is invest in things you find interesting. If you find them interesting, you're going to want to do the research, you're going to want to listen to the conference calls, you're going to be less stressed. There's not one thing that I'm invested in that I don't give a shit about. \n\nBe very aware of your risk tolerance and don't invest more than you feel comfortable with.\n\nSo take the weekend to think about whether you want to own the companies you own, get some names together and next week it would surprise me if the market didn't go lower.\n\nOr you may decide after this weekend that you want to be in funds and not devote as much time to this in terms of researching individual names - and that's okay, too.", "score": 6, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 13, "submission_ratio": 0.46153846153846156, "submission_title": "Just started this week and I am lost.", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Just started this week and I am lost.

So I\u2019ll tell you how I learned to deal with that. Odd, but one of the greatest tip I was given:\n\nAfter my first few trades, I was down ~$50 or so from a weak/declining stock that my noobie self bought. I decided to wait and hope to break even before dumping the stock because i didn\u2019t want to lose that $50. \n\nAfter 2 months i was still down ~$47. A reddit stranger told me to just cut my losses and invest into another growing stock and I would make back that loss FASTER than waiting on the old one to break even. \n\nSo that\u2019s what i did. \n\nAfter a little over a month, I gained ~160 or so. Now imagine what I could\u2019ve made had I just cut my losses from the beginning rather than waiting on the old weak stock to bounce back/break even. \n\nMy point is that since you probably lost $15-$20 overall from GE, this will save you time in the long run and possibly net more gain by switching to a different stock rather than waiting for GE to bounce back. (It probably will, but most likely won\u2019t be for a long time and it\u2019s not worth the wait financially.)\n\nWelcome to the new exciting world of investing/trading.

The past 2 months I was up about 12% and I'd say a lot of people were much luckier than I was those 2 months (I'm looking at you Amazon and Netflix share holders).   \nWorried or not, you should look into some ETF's.

Worst Dow stock for the last 17 years, terribly managed for 16 of those, new management is ... someone who has been at GE since the 80's.\n\n\"35 APHQF @ 14.98,\"\n\nPot stocks were a mania and there was tremendous FOMO (fear of missing out) momentum. This is what it looks like when FOMO momentum stalls out. Canopy Growth is something like 40% off the highs ... of January.\n\n\"Bought 10 EBAY @ 46.17,\"\n\nYou bought after a stock that has done not much for ages had a surprise positive quarter and was up over 10%. Don't chase things up 10%.\n\nIt sucks to have a week like this, but you know what? It's okay. It's a learning experience and you're going to have those throughout your time investing, but especially early on.\n\nWhat I would suggest doing is this:\n\nTake the weekend, really look around at stocks and come up with a few names where you really have a strong thesis for the company for a few years out - by high quality names that you feel confident in. If you have a strong thesis in something and feel confident in it, you're not going to feel nearly like you do right now. If you invest in your best ideas, then you're going to want to add to them if the market is down a thousand points in a week. \n\nI'd look at names like Danaher (DHR), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), Heico (HEI.A or HEI, non-voting/voting), Liberty Formula One (FWONA)/Liberty Ventures (LVNTA), Microsoft (MSFT), Constellation (STZ, especially if it gets a bit lower), Visa/Mastercard (V/MA) Given that Apple has basically said that it will start putting a significant amount of the cash that it's been sitting on to work, that's interesting if it gets a bit lower next week. \n\nWhat else? Berkshire (although Buffett/Munger will probably not be running it for that many more years), Roper (ROP), Becton Dickinson (BDX), Vail (MTN, although that's a bit inconsistent and having a so-so year given lackluster snowfall), the exchanges (CME, CBOE, NDAQ, ICE), the cell tower REITs (CCI, AMT) the cell tower soon-to-be-a-REIT (SBA), pet health (IDXX, ZTS, although I'd wait for both to come down some more), car tech co Aptiv (APTV), rails (CNI, UNP, etc), banks (although I really only like JPM). Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM). Madison Square Garden (MSG) is a fun option. Riskier growth, as well - Tencent, JD, BABA (or BABA alternative AABA), Square, Shopify, Paypal. \n\nUltimately, you have to do the homework and come to your own conclusion on what to invest in but the above is just throwing out a lot of names to consider.\n\nThere's so many other great companies. And these can certainly go down too.\n\nHave your dividends set to reinvest; even if it's a small amount, it's still more shares being added on every time a dividend occurs.\n\nPersonally, I think what helps me a lot is that I don't invest in what I want to own tomorrow or next week, because I have no idea what things will do tomorrow or next week, I invest with a view towards what I would like to own 3-5 years out. If you focus entirely on what your investments do day-to-day, you're going to find investing is a very frustrating experience - but I think having significant confidence in your investments helps in trying to let your money work for you rather than constantly trying to look over your money's shoulder while it's trying to work for you.\n\nThe other thing is invest in things you find interesting. If you find them interesting, you're going to want to do the research, you're going to want to listen to the conference calls, you're going to be less stressed. There's not one thing that I'm invested in that I don't give a shit about. \n\nBe very aware of your risk tolerance and don't invest more than you feel comfortable with.\n\nSo take the weekend to think about whether you want to own the companies you own, get some names together and next week it would surprise me if the market didn't go lower.\n\nOr you may decide after this weekend that you want to be in funds and not devote as much time to this in terms of researching individual names - and that's okay, too.", "parent_score": 6, "parent_ratio": 0.16666666666666666}, {"time": 1517692724.0, "submission_id": "7uvmp6", "comment_id": "dtowg2e", "body": "Thanks for the advice, I\u2019m definitely going to sell first thing on Monday!", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 13, "submission_ratio": 0.07692307692307693, "submission_title": "Just started this week and I am lost.", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "So now that you learned GE was a bad buy and probably contemplating on dumping it or holding and hope to break even before selling.\n\nGiven that you just started investing, I understand that cutting your losses from GE & move on is hard (we\u2019re all noobies once). So I\u2019ll tell you how I learned to deal with that. Odd, but one of the greatest tip I was given:\n\nAfter my first few trades, I was down ~$50 or so from a weak/declining stock that my noobie self bought. I decided to wait and hope to break even before dumping the stock because i didn\u2019t want to lose that $50. \n\nAfter 2 months i was still down ~$47. A reddit stranger told me to just cut my losses and invest into another growing stock and I would make back that loss FASTER than waiting on the old one to break even. \n\nSo that\u2019s what i did. \n\nAfter a little over a month, I gained ~160 or so. Now imagine what I could\u2019ve made had I just cut my losses from the beginning rather than waiting on the old weak stock to bounce back/break even. \n\nMy point is that since you probably lost $15-$20 overall from GE, this will save you time in the long run and possibly net more gain by switching to a different stock rather than waiting for GE to bounce back. (It probably will, but most likely won\u2019t be for a long time and it\u2019s not worth the wait financially.)\n\nWelcome to the new exciting world of investing/trading.
