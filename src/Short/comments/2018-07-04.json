I even said I owned one. Let's look at the numbers.  \n\n\nSale of units- Total- 17.79 units as of March 31st  \n\n\nSales first month (US)-1.2 million (120 ten thousands units as they put it).   \n\n\nSales for the first quarter of  2018 (US)- 1.2 million   \n\n\nThis is what is meant by sluggish sales, when in Nov they wanted 25 million by the end on 2018.   \n\n\n\\>  Switch games have plastered the sales charts globally   \n\n\nPlastered is over stating the case. Let me be clear some of the games released have been amazing, with mario and zelda being game of the year candidates. With that said game sales results.  \n\n\nTotal Mario 10.4 million Mario kart 9.22 Zelda 8.48 Splatoon 2 6.02  1-2 switch 2.29 (and gets lower from there).  \n\n\nThis netted 3 of the 10 top selling games (5, 9, and 10). Zelda, and Mario kart were launch window games. Splat came out in late summer and Mario late fall. Beyond these titles there was very little of note. Which wouldn't matter if there were many other major titles being released this year. So far.....   and according to E3 ... pokemon go and Smash (I would wager this will in the long term be the #2 or #3 most sold on the platform).   \n\n\nThis might be different if there was a massively strong indie / non nintendo set of games. This hasn't proved to be the case. Mainly because very few people (myself included) will spend the amount they want on an indie title if that title costs more on it. There also hasn't been a massive amount of third party titles titles either.   \n\n\nI want Nintendo to be better. I want more games (I will be purchasing octopath traveler once it comes out). I completely understand why investors are not willing to wait and hope there will be amazing games on some future whim.   \n\n\nSources- [https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard\\_soft/number.html](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/number.html)  \n\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/01/19/the-best-selling-video-games-of-2017/#3c77fb336226](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/01/19/the-best-selling-video-games-of-2017/#3c77fb336226)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/05/23/april-2018-switch-sales-9-5-out-of-top-10-are-nintendo-franchises/#378ad5d75200](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/05/23/april-2018-switch-sales-9-5-out-of-top-10-are-nintendo-franchises/#378ad5d75200)", "score": 5, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 178, "submission_ratio": 0.028089887640449437, "submission_title": "Nintendo down -5.27%.

I\u2019m going to read up on them and look into it more as some of the stuff you posted sounds impressive. Not sure if I\u2019ll add it to my portfolio as I\u2019m already struggling with keeping up and current with my holdings right now but like having stuff like this on the back burner. Couple questions if you\u2019d like to answer.\n\n1) Do you feel we\u2019re in any sort of beer \u201cbubble\u201d at the moment? I know Boston Beer/Sam Adams isn\u2019t your local, small craft beer company and is pretty established but I wonder if it could still be impacted if the industry takes a turn for the worse. It seems like today everyone is into brewing their own beers or drinking craft, homemade, or small company ones. The unique or new flavors with catchy names are becoming super popular as well. How are they or how do they intend to handle this trend? Are they working on producing their own flavors and brands or instead relying on buying up smaller yet successful craft companies.\n\n2) Similar to my first question, has Boston Beer gone on any recent buying sprees with these smaller, craft companies? One thing that concerns me is how often many of the smaller companies are being brought by the big guys. What happens if this craft or local beer trend ends and these guys are left with a bunch of underperforming companies and demand is no longer as strong as it was? Companies like Boston Beer are kind of stuck in a damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t type of situation where buying these companies could be costly down the line if they underperform or trends change while in the same breath not buying them leaves these companies are competing against them and taking a share of their market.\n\n3) How do you value them at the moment? Like I said earlier, I never really looked into them as a company but seeing that their price has more than doubled in one year is pretty nuts. Is there still room for growth? Are they overvalued? \n\nAgain, really enjoyed reading this.

As someone who loves beer, I still will go to Sam Adams when in doubt. Love their beers, and always will.

If times are tough, people won't be going to a brewery to drink a $8 beer, no matter how good it is. I agree, I love these small breweries due to the location and taste, but if  money was tight I would be buying more from the store and enjoying the discounted price in my backyard. I feel like the majority of the small brewery income is from the brewery sales, not as much from the store.

I like to try to buy for growth and hold awhile and I\u2019ve never been able to pull the trigger on them. I thought they were over valued a year ago at $200 and they\u2019ve climbed to $300 now so I\u2019m an idiot. A lot of that growth isn\u2019t in beer though it\u2019s hard tea, seltzer, and cider. Their beer sales are actually slowing.\n\n 1. As large as the beer market is, a small fraction of beer drinkers brew their own. They are a blip on the radar and typically still buy a lot of their beer anyway. Technically people consider Sam Adams a craft brewery but at 4 million barrels a year and a billion in revenue it\u2019s not a craft brewery anymore. You\u2019re right that people tend to prefer small, local options over large \u201ccraft\u201d beer companies. SAM puts out trendy \u201cflavors\u201d and mimics the current trends and fads of the craft brew industry. They only do that through seasonal and limited releases though and they don\u2019t always have great distribution outside of the east coast. They attend beer festivals in an attempt to keep up the appearance of a craft brewery. A lot of craft brew festivals where I\u2019m at won\u2019t accept them. I\u2019m in Denver and I\u2019ve heard from a few organizers they don\u2019t want them in their lineup because they\u2019re too commercial but they brag that New Belgium is going to their event. New Belgium is still huge as the 4th largest craft brewer in the US and a quarter of Sam\u2019s size (1 million barrels, $250 million revenue). It\u2019s probably because new Belgium is an hour up the road but NB also comes out with new and interesting beer all the time. The experimentation aspect is what gives craft beer the allure it has. Sam doesn\u2019t have a great name in the craft beer world outside of the east coast. They don\u2019t push the experiment envelope like some other brewers do. Sam\u2019s Octoberfest beer was one of the first and that\u2019s still a very popular fall beer. That was also a decade ago though. They just came out with an addition to their standard line up with Sam \u201876 and released it like it was revolutionizing their brand. They talked about it like it was going to be BIG. Guess what...It\u2019s a lager they added Citra hops to. It\u2019s a good beer to be fair but the industry had a Citra Hops fad in 2015. It took them 3 years to release one. Not quite \u201ccutting edge\u201d. Liquor stores here typically stock Sam next to Pabst, corona, Bud, Miller, and Coors which says a lot.\n\n2. With that being said, their craft beer sells have slowed recently. A lot of their growth as come from cider. (which I\u2019ll be the first to admit, I did not see that coming) Beer is a crowded market space and they\u2019re in an awkward position in that market space. They aren\u2019t the \u201cbig beer\u201d companies but they aren\u2019t quite \u201ccraft\u201d. I think to maintain growth of their beer, they need to start rethinking their position on buying craft brews. Historically, they\u2019ve been openly opposed to the Big Beer Companies buying small crafter beers and say it\u2019s killing beer but if they want to compete long term, they need to start working on cash reserves to go out and buy some. As long as they buy breweries that have manageable debt they should weather any downturn just fine. Alcohol sells well in a bad economy. Even premium beer. I don\u2019t believe craft beer is a fad and very few people in the industry believe it is. Look at ABINBEV and MillerCoors and where they\u2019ve been putting their money over the past decade. There were some acquisition rumors not too long ago for Boston Beer Co as well.

Couple questions if you\u2019d like to answer.      \n\nNo worries! Appreciate the kind words! Even though personally I think they'll be closer to $330-$340 by August/September (after earnings) it's definitely a low volatility, long play overall.     \n\n> Do you feel we\u2019re in any sort of beer \u201cbubble\u201d at the moment?    \n\n100% I do, to a point, but I don't feel like the big players themselves have a shit ton to worry about. The U.S. is leaps and bounds ahead of other countries as far as craft beer goes and for anyone who has everything figured out for the most part ($SAM, Dogfish, Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, etc) it's not like they're going to get completely blown out nationally by smaller craft breweries. The main appeal for local craft breweries is their brewpub itself, and I say this as someone who is a huge advocate of most of the local breweries around my area.    \n\nThe main advantage that the larger breweries have is that they have their supply chain + production + distribution figured out for the most part. They can produce a product that's of significant quality and do so nationwide, consistently, while keeping it at a lower price than local breweries. While that somewhat sucks as far as local brewers are concerned, it's essentially just the fact of the matter and good breweries will still continue to survive.    \n\n> has Boston Beer gone on any recent buying sprees with these smaller, craft companies?\n\nNot in too aggressive of a way, which is why I'm extremely bullish with the new CEO. They definitely have the ability to and I believe they will over the next few years.     \n\nCurrently they've acquired the Coney Island Brewing Company, Angel City Brewery, and Concrete Beach Brewery. Nothing too insane and I somewhat suspect that previously they were big on the \"not invented here\" syndrome due to quality standards/control, but I think with Burwick at the helm they'll find a happy medium.    \n\n> What happens if this craft or local beer trend ends and these guys are left with a bunch of underperforming companies and demand is no longer as strong as it was?    \n\nThe craft beer demand could drop, but as someone who loves craft beer themselves I don't see that happening at all. After Carter helped kick off the craft beer revolution itself, it's pretty much became its own self-sustaining market. Are there a ton of breweries that are open now that are going to fail? Definitely. But the tech industry has winners and losers as well, and Amazon isn't going to fail. Same for $SAM. IMO they'll diversify enough to cover any losses on their beer line as best they can, so from a shareholder perspective I feel fine. But even then, I don't see Sam Adams Beer ever having a major issue with demand for their product.     \n\n\n> How do you value them at the moment?     \n\nI think anything under $300 is a steal. I'm definitely priced in a ton lower myself, but I'm continuing to average up + buy short term calls, as my price target for the end of the summer has been $340, but now I've been considering even raising that up to $360. EOY I can see them being closer to, if not at, $400. From there, not sure. I just think that they're going to have a hell of a summer revenue-wise which should help them overall + the guidance is great.    \n\nThanks for the Qs + making me think!", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 16, "submission_ratio": 0.125, "submission_title": "$SAM (The Boston Beer Company) DD/Bullish Analysis", "submission_text": "First time ever writing one of these, so hopefully this doesn\u2019t suck content/formatting-wise.        \n\n***Disclosure: I own/am long $SAM.***\n\n\n**tl;dr:** The Boston Beer Company is a great buy at its current price and I believe that it will continue to prosper under the guidance of new leadership and its product offerings.    \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Quick facts:**    \n- Dave Burwick (former CEO of Peet's coffee) has joined $SAM at the helm as the new CEO of the company.\n- Product shipment volume has increased since last Q1 reports by 15% on the year.\n- Q1 EPS was reported as 0.78, ~42% growth over the same period last year (Q1 reports are always their weakest, but that\u2019s fairly typical for this industry in general)\n- Depletions (this tracks how much product is moved from warehouse to stores) grew by 8%.\n- Non \u201cSam Adams Beer\u201d products owned by $SAM (Truly Hard Seltzer, Angry Orchard, and others) appear to be doing significantly well in their respective markets, offsetting a decrease in performance by its standard beer products.\n\n**Analysis/Opinions:**\n\n**CEO:**    \nOne of the most promising indicators of future growth for the company - to me - is bringing on Dave Burwick as CEO to replace Martin Roper.

Guess what...It\u2019s a lager they added Citra hops to. It\u2019s a good beer to be fair but the industry had a Citra Hops fad in 2015. It took them 3 years to release one.

As long as they buy breweries that have manageable debt they should weather any downturn just fine. Alcohol sells well in a bad economy. Even premium beer.

Couple questions if you\u2019d like to answer.      \n\nNo worries! Appreciate the kind words! Even though personally I think they'll be closer to $330-$340 by August/September (after earnings) it's definitely a low volatility, long play overall.     \n\n> Do you feel we\u2019re in any sort of beer \u201cbubble\u201d at the moment?    \n\n100% I do, to a point, but I don't feel like the big players themselves have a shit ton to worry about. The U.S. is leaps and bounds ahead of other countries as far as craft beer goes and for anyone who has everything figured out for the most part ($SAM, Dogfish, Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, etc) it's not like they're going to get completely blown out nationally by smaller craft breweries. The main appeal for local craft breweries is their brewpub itself, and I say this as someone who is a huge advocate of most of the local breweries around my area.    \n\nThe main advantage that the larger breweries have is that they have their supply chain + production + distribution figured out for the most part. They can produce a product that's of significant quality and do so nationwide, consistently, while keeping it at a lower price than local breweries. While that somewhat sucks as far as local brewers are concerned, it's essentially just the fact of the matter and good breweries will still continue to survive.    \n\n> has Boston Beer gone on any recent buying sprees with these smaller, craft companies?\n\nNot in too aggressive of a way, which is why I'm extremely bullish with the new CEO. They definitely have the ability to and I believe they will over the next few years.     \n\nCurrently they've acquired the Coney Island Brewing Company, Angel City Brewery, and Concrete Beach Brewery. Nothing too insane and I somewhat suspect that previously they were big on the \"not invented here\" syndrome due to quality standards/control, but I think with Burwick at the helm they'll find a happy medium.    \n\n> What happens if this craft or local beer trend ends and these guys are left with a bunch of underperforming companies and demand is no longer as strong as it was?    \n\nThe craft beer demand could drop, but as someone who loves craft beer themselves I don't see that happening at all. After Carter helped kick off the craft beer revolution itself, it's pretty much became its own self-sustaining market. Are there a ton of breweries that are open now that are going to fail? Definitely. But the tech industry has winners and losers as well, and Amazon isn't going to fail. Same for $SAM. IMO they'll diversify enough to cover any losses on their beer line as best they can, so from a shareholder perspective I feel fine. But even then, I don't see Sam Adams Beer ever having a major issue with demand for their product.     \n\n\n> How do you value them at the moment?     \n\nI think anything under $300 is a steal. I'm definitely priced in a ton lower myself, but I'm continuing to average up + buy short term calls, as my price target for the end of the summer has been $340, but now I've been considering even raising that up to $360. EOY I can see them being closer to, if not at, $400. From there, not sure. I just think that they're going to have a hell of a summer revenue-wise which should help them overall + the guidance is great.    \n\nThanks for the Qs + making me think!", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1530770677.0, "submission_id": "8w3fyx", "comment_id": "e1thc0r", "body": "You\u2019re right.

They made a good, low abv, citrusy lager/session ale. Again...it\u2019s good.

Definitely has some citra in it, but also has a few other hops as well to where it comes off more as almost a fruity, light lager... which I really haven't had too many of, nor have I ever brewed myself.    \n\n> Liquor stores here typically stock Sam next to Pabst, corona, Bud, Miller, and Coors which says a lot.    \n\nFrom what I've seen, usually they have either their own column next to the craft beer section or are included in it, but that's definitely interesting. IMO $SAM beer is great craft beer overall, but since they're \"known\" they also have the advantage/disadvantage of being the craft beer for people who don't drink craft beer. Basically like Shock Top or Goose Island.    \n\n> There were some acquisition rumors not too long ago for Boston Beer Co as well.     \n\nIIRC people were suggesting they'd be bought out by Molson Coors, but TBH until Jim Koch passes away I'd bet my portfolio that there's a grand total of 0% chance that they'll ever sell. He cares too much about the end product itself to let it be too far outside of his hands, which is why he himself owns majority on the voting stock offering for $SAM.
