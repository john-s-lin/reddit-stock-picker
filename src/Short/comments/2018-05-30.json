And in with CRSP the possibility of offering certain cures, or preventing illness can truly be considered priceless.\n\nNot to go full Sci fi, but after treating disease is becoming more common there will be more and more healthy wealthy people who will give anything to live longer. Id say an extra 25 years of healthy life beyond the average life expectancy isnt priceless but it is very very valuable.\n\nAdding time to the genetic clock inside our telomeres, would be the closest man kind has ever come to a fountain of youth. And the elite, ultra wealthy and influentially poweful will get this first. Maybe it won't be CRISPR but it would be naive to think some very rich aren't already giving their babies a genetic head start... Even if it's still subtle modifications and enhancement now, it will become more obvious as the technology improves and the children age. It's not illegal to do this in China and the USA, most other developed nations have made this illegal.\n\nFor example, (and I can't prove this, it just a theory I'd love to  see researched) people are noticing that wealthy couples, are having babies that are one boy and one girl. Celebrities seem to be a group having more instances of male and female twins. One of each gender is desirable in western culture and twins are desirable.... But also having twins is great for publicity, and greatly benefits celebrities media attention. Entertainment media loves celebrities babies, but twins are the jackpot and articles or videos get far more views or clicks. Having twins had been shown to gain far more public interest.\n\nSo are celebs having more twins than anytime in history? And are the twins more often one male and one female?\n\nIMO people who are motivated and can pay the costs have are already been editing thier babies genes. We cant see much of the changes but greed never fails so if it's happening, it will be exposed in time. Because the options on what to edit and enhance will become more and more sophisticated to the point its too hard to deny. And we will see the rich begin living longer and longer, more than diet and exercise would add to the lifespan. Again greed for money will expose this, as people will pay anything to live longer.\n\nWhat would you pay to give your child the best life possible? What would you pay to live an extra 30 years to watch that child or grandchild thrive?\nIf your ultra wealthy I bet that money wouldn't be a concern at all.
