There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%!

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011.

Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome Thanksgiving holiday with family and friends! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n# **Trump's trade talks with China could snap markets out of their funk  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)**\n*****\n> As stocks enter the short Thanksgiving holiday week, investors looking for any signs of a market comeback are paying close attention to trade developments with China.\n*****\nThe coming week could be an important turning point for two big fear factors for markets \u2014 trade wars and rising interest rates.\n*****\n> The big event of the week, and one that could impact markets and the economy for months to come, is the meeting between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 in Buenos Aires, which starts Friday. There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a really awesome Thanksgiving holiday with family and friends! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n# **Trump's trade talks with China could snap markets out of their funk  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)**\n*****\n> As stocks enter the short Thanksgiving holiday week, investors looking for any signs of a market comeback are paying close attention to trade developments with China.\n*****\nThe coming week could be an important turning point for two big fear factors for markets \u2014 trade wars and rising interest rates.\n*****\n> The big event of the week, and one that could impact markets and the economy for months to come, is the meeting between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 in Buenos Aires, which starts Friday. There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.

There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.\n*****\n> There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.\n*****\n> Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.\n*****\n> Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.\n*****\n> \"It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.\n*****\n> \"The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,\" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.\n*****\n> \"We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,\" he added.\n*****\n> U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.\n*****\n> But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zbva82t.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/GFkhpOH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DpSCQaK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MGr0pgA.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MBXEMj3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/q3glfXj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AuXUhPf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5rEQaP4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pAaaPXt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOTFfYo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/L7suPMl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far\n\n> With the S&P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).\n\n> Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&P\u2019s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.\n\n> Of course, it\u2019s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.\n\n> And in case you don\u2019t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorstQ4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.25.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$CRM** \n> * **$WB** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$TIF** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$BOX** \n> * **$DSX** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$JKS** \n> * **$SINA** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$HIBB** \n> * **$KSHB** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMBA** \n> * **$HMLP** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$DAVA** \n> * **$RY** \n> * **$SJM** \n> * **$GME** \n> * **$JILL** \n> * **$VJET** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$ITRN** \n> * **$TD** \n> * **$PAGS** \n> * **$KNOP** \n> * **$TLYS** \n> * **$BKE** \n> * **$GSM** \n> * **$HPQ** \n> * **$TECD**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MAruvLd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XbHesrI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/8sPLuQL.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning November 26th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QlIm4ib.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 11.26.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JjYevsA.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dvQcC5p.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 11.27.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vrynE1g.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFETWmZ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 11.28.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M8rGJ7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/x8FYlEd.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 11.29.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/J3fyyYR.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HD8qKaw.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 11.30.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Salesforce $122.03 \n> **Salesforce (CRM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Tuesday, November 27, 2018.
