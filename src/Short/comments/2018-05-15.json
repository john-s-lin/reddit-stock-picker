[{"time": 1526443058.0, "submission_id": "8jqz5m", "comment_id": "dz217vd", "body": "Hiya!  Portfolio development is my favorite thing to talk about!  I utilize a personalized stop loss for each position, that amounts to essentially the same risk taken per trade.  This stop loss is individualized to each position, which I will also explain more about at the end.  So here is how it works.\n\n\n\n\nEach position you have, will have a unique stop loss.  A stop loss closes you out of a trade if it goes beyond a certain level of losing money, removing the ability to be emotional about it.  The objective of a stop loss is to help you figure out what your max loss would be assuming the stock fully \"breaks down\" and moves against you, rather than just experiences market noise and psyches you out.  It takes out the emotional part of trading, and makes it numerical (which is more consistent).  This also helps you improve your chances of selling your winners before they are truly \"out of the game\".  Why am I mentioning all of this?  Determining this beforehand directly helps you size your positions accordingly.  I trade with each position risking 1-2% of my portfolio.  Meaning if it went completely wrong I would lose 1% of my entire portfolio on that trade.  This is a professionally recommended and utilized method.  How does this help?  Well lets take a look at an example.\n\n\n\n\nLets say you have a portfolio of $100,000;\n\n\n\nYour 1% risk per trade would be $1000.  So you could have a position of $10,000 that has a stop loss of 10%, representing a 1% total portfolio risk.  You could also have a position of $3750 with a 26.6% stop loss that represents the exact same risk.  The reason this is important is because it tells you that a volatile stock inherently deserves a smaller position size then a less volatile stock, because the potential for gain and risk are equally larger.  This is the first fundamental basis of safe portfolio development.  (Volatility can be measured as the standard deviation of a stock within a period of time, sometimes called return range, or risk).\n\n\n\nNow how do you determine the specific stop loss for each stock?  A few different ways.  I personally utilize software called TradeStops by Dr. Richard Smith, who developed an algorithm to determine a stock's individualized \"range\" that it trades in, and offers a stop loss directly outside that range.  If you weren't looking to get that hardcore into it, what you can also do is simply look at charts, and make a judgement based on the support levels.\n\n\nHeres two examples.  Looking at the chart for Mastercard (Ticker:  MA), you'll see a very smooth uptrend throughout the past two years.  This was a great returns, very low volatile play, and even survived the big dips in February and March without much volatility.  It has a daily standard deviation of about 2%, and a monthly deviation of about 8%.  My stop loss for a position on Mastercard would be around 16%.  If the position ever fell 16% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and it should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $6250 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .16  =  $6250\n\n\n\nSecond example.  Looking at the chart for Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA), you'll see another uptrend, but just not quite as smooth as MA.  This was also a play with great returns, but higher volatility, especially during the past three months.  NVDA has a daily standard deviation of about 3.02% and a monthly deviation of about 13.43%.  My stop loss for a position on NVDA would be around 28%.  If the position ever fell 28% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $3571 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .28  =  $3571\n\n\n\nThese two examples show that while the returns of the stock can be similar, the volatility (risk) of each investment should be a significant factor in deciding how much to allocate.  You could have a LOT of small risky positions (speculator), or you could also have a mix of smaller riskier positions mixed with larger less risky positions and a spatter of diversification in between (investor).  I have done very successfully with this so far, currently returning an Alpha (against the SPY) of 7% YTD.  This method is backtested on 20 years of data, and improves returns on same-stock portfolios nearly every single time.\n\n\nAll of this being said, this becomes more effective the more you have because otherwise commission fees eat you up.  Doing the math, I would always like the commission to be less than 1% of the risk per trade, that way you don't end up starting each position down on commission trying to take such small stakes.  Mathematically this would mean at a commission of $5.95,  your minimum position size should really be $595\n\n\nLove - Guy who loves investing\n\n\n\np.s.  I saw a comment talking about options.  I also heavily trade options, and do the same for this.  My debit spreads, and long calls/puts will have a max loss representing 1-2% of my portfolio.  The only exception I make is that I allow my credit spreads to exceed my typical risk range, due to the higher probability nature of the trades, and the ability to micromanage the trade more actively.  As for risk:reward ratios, I prefer 4:1 or lower on credit spreads, and 2:1 or lower on debit spreads or I don't even really consider it.  Long calls/puts vary widely in profitability but still follow the risk profile unless there is a STRONG conviction towards one way on a trade.\n\n", "score": 164, "num_replies": 11, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 76, "submission_ratio": 2.1578947368421053, "submission_title": "How much is \"a position\" for you?", "submission_text": "I'm wondering what the average \"position\" amount is for this sub, i.e. when said \"buy a full position\", \"don't buy a full position\", etc. ", "parent_text": "How much is \"a position\" for you?

Portfolio development is my favorite thing to talk about!  I utilize a personalized stop loss for each position, that amounts to essentially the same risk taken per trade.  This stop loss is individualized to each position, which I will also explain more about at the end.  So here is how it works.\n\n\n\n\nEach position you have, will have a unique stop loss.  A stop loss closes you out of a trade if it goes beyond a certain level of losing money, removing the ability to be emotional about it.  The objective of a stop loss is to help you figure out what your max loss would be assuming the stock fully \"breaks down\" and moves against you, rather than just experiences market noise and psyches you out.  It takes out the emotional part of trading, and makes it numerical (which is more consistent).  This also helps you improve your chances of selling your winners before they are truly \"out of the game\".  Why am I mentioning all of this?  Determining this beforehand directly helps you size your positions accordingly.  I trade with each position risking 1-2% of my portfolio.  Meaning if it went completely wrong I would lose 1% of my entire portfolio on that trade.  This is a professionally recommended and utilized method.  How does this help?  Well lets take a look at an example.\n\n\n\n\nLets say you have a portfolio of $100,000;\n\n\n\nYour 1% risk per trade would be $1000.  So you could have a position of $10,000 that has a stop loss of 10%, representing a 1% total portfolio risk.  You could also have a position of $3750 with a 26.6% stop loss that represents the exact same risk.  The reason this is important is because it tells you that a volatile stock inherently deserves a smaller position size then a less volatile stock, because the potential for gain and risk are equally larger.  This is the first fundamental basis of safe portfolio development.  (Volatility can be measured as the standard deviation of a stock within a period of time, sometimes called return range, or risk).\n\n\n\nNow how do you determine the specific stop loss for each stock?  A few different ways.  I personally utilize software called TradeStops by Dr. Richard Smith, who developed an algorithm to determine a stock's individualized \"range\" that it trades in, and offers a stop loss directly outside that range.  If you weren't looking to get that hardcore into it, what you can also do is simply look at charts, and make a judgement based on the support levels.\n\n\nHeres two examples.  Looking at the chart for Mastercard (Ticker:  MA), you'll see a very smooth uptrend throughout the past two years.  This was a great returns, very low volatile play, and even survived the big dips in February and March without much volatility.  It has a daily standard deviation of about 2%, and a monthly deviation of about 8%.  My stop loss for a position on Mastercard would be around 16%.  If the position ever fell 16% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and it should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $6250 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .16  =  $6250\n\n\n\nSecond example.  Looking at the chart for Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA), you'll see another uptrend, but just not quite as smooth as MA.  This was also a play with great returns, but higher volatility, especially during the past three months.  NVDA has a daily standard deviation of about 3.02% and a monthly deviation of about 13.43%.  My stop loss for a position on NVDA would be around 28%.  If the position ever fell 28% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $3571 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .28  =  $3571\n\n\n\nThese two examples show that while the returns of the stock can be similar, the volatility (risk) of each investment should be a significant factor in deciding how much to allocate.  You could have a LOT of small risky positions (speculator), or you could also have a mix of smaller riskier positions mixed with larger less risky positions and a spatter of diversification in between (investor).  I have done very successfully with this so far, currently returning an Alpha (against the SPY) of 7% YTD.  This method is backtested on 20 years of data, and improves returns on same-stock portfolios nearly every single time.\n\n\nAll of this being said, this becomes more effective the more you have because otherwise commission fees eat you up.  Doing the math, I would always like the commission to be less than 1% of the risk per trade, that way you don't end up starting each position down on commission trying to take such small stakes.  Mathematically this would mean at a commission of $5.95,  your minimum position size should really be $595\n\n\nLove - Guy who loves investing\n\n\n\np.s.  I saw a comment talking about options.  I also heavily trade options, and do the same for this.  My debit spreads, and long calls/puts will have a max loss representing 1-2% of my portfolio.  The only exception I make is that I allow my credit spreads to exceed my typical risk range, due to the higher probability nature of the trades, and the ability to micromanage the trade more actively.  As for risk:reward ratios, I prefer 4:1 or lower on credit spreads, and 2:1 or lower on debit spreads or I don't even really consider it.  Long calls/puts vary widely in profitability but still follow the risk profile unless there is a STRONG conviction towards one way on a trade.\n\n", "parent_score": 164, "parent_ratio": 0.11585365853658537}, {"time": 1526467624.0, "submission_id": "8jqz5m", "comment_id": "dz2e713", "body": "What do you do when a stock is growing, so that the risk with your stop loss exceeds your 1% threshold?

A stop loss closes you out of a trade if it goes beyond a certain level of losing money, removing the ability to be emotional about it.  The objective of a stop loss is to help you figure out what your max loss would be assuming the stock fully \"breaks down\" and moves against you, rather than just experiences market noise and psyches you out.  It takes out the emotional part of trading, and makes it numerical (which is more consistent).  This also helps you improve your chances of selling your winners before they are truly \"out of the game\".  Why am I mentioning all of this?  Determining this beforehand directly helps you size your positions accordingly.  I trade with each position risking 1-2% of my portfolio.  Meaning if it went completely wrong I would lose 1% of my entire portfolio on that trade.  This is a professionally recommended and utilized method.  How does this help?  Well lets take a look at an example.\n\n\n\n\nLets say you have a portfolio of $100,000;\n\n\n\nYour 1% risk per trade would be $1000.  So you could have a position of $10,000 that has a stop loss of 10%, representing a 1% total portfolio risk.  You could also have a position of $3750 with a 26.6% stop loss that represents the exact same risk.  The reason this is important is because it tells you that a volatile stock inherently deserves a smaller position size then a less volatile stock, because the potential for gain and risk are equally larger.  This is the first fundamental basis of safe portfolio development.  (Volatility can be measured as the standard deviation of a stock within a period of time, sometimes called return range, or risk).\n\n\n\nNow how do you determine the specific stop loss for each stock?  A few different ways.  I personally utilize software called TradeStops by Dr. Richard Smith, who developed an algorithm to determine a stock's individualized \"range\" that it trades in, and offers a stop loss directly outside that range.  If you weren't looking to get that hardcore into it, what you can also do is simply look at charts, and make a judgement based on the support levels.\n\n\nHeres two examples.  Looking at the chart for Mastercard (Ticker:  MA), you'll see a very smooth uptrend throughout the past two years.  This was a great returns, very low volatile play, and even survived the big dips in February and March without much volatility.  It has a daily standard deviation of about 2%, and a monthly deviation of about 8%.  My stop loss for a position on Mastercard would be around 16%.  If the position ever fell 16% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and it should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $6250 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .16  =  $6250\n\n\n\nSecond example.  Looking at the chart for Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA), you'll see another uptrend, but just not quite as smooth as MA.  This was also a play with great returns, but higher volatility, especially during the past three months.  NVDA has a daily standard deviation of about 3.02% and a monthly deviation of about 13.43%.  My stop loss for a position on NVDA would be around 28%.  If the position ever fell 28% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $3571 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .28  =  $3571\n\n\n\nThese two examples show that while the returns of the stock can be similar, the volatility (risk) of each investment should be a significant factor in deciding how much to allocate.  You could have a LOT of small risky positions (speculator), or you could also have a mix of smaller riskier positions mixed with larger less risky positions and a spatter of diversification in between (investor).  I have done very successfully with this so far, currently returning an Alpha (against the SPY) of 7% YTD.  This method is backtested on 20 years of data, and improves returns on same-stock portfolios nearly every single time.\n\n\nAll of this being said, this becomes more effective the more you have because otherwise commission fees eat you up.  Doing the math, I would always like the commission to be less than 1% of the risk per trade, that way you don't end up starting each position down on commission trying to take such small stakes.  Mathematically this would mean at a commission of $5.95,  your minimum position size should really be $595\n\n\nLove - Guy who loves investing\n\n\n\np.s.  I saw a comment talking about options.  I also heavily trade options, and do the same for this.  My debit spreads, and long calls/puts will have a max loss representing 1-2% of my portfolio.  The only exception I make is that I allow my credit spreads to exceed my typical risk range, due to the higher probability nature of the trades, and the ability to micromanage the trade more actively.  As for risk:reward ratios, I prefer 4:1 or lower on credit spreads, and 2:1 or lower on debit spreads or I don't even really consider it.  Long calls/puts vary widely in profitability but still follow the risk profile unless there is a STRONG conviction towards one way on a trade.\n\n", "parent_score": 164, "parent_ratio": 0.012195121951219513}, {"time": 1526472402.0, "submission_id": "8jqz5m", "comment_id": "dz2h3d3", "body": "Looks like you set your decline trigger at 2 standard deviations.

Portfolio development is my favorite thing to talk about!  I utilize a personalized stop loss for each position, that amounts to essentially the same risk taken per trade.  This stop loss is individualized to each position, which I will also explain more about at the end.  So here is how it works.\n\n\n\n\nEach position you have, will have a unique stop loss.  A stop loss closes you out of a trade if it goes beyond a certain level of losing money, removing the ability to be emotional about it.  The objective of a stop loss is to help you figure out what your max loss would be assuming the stock fully \"breaks down\" and moves against you, rather than just experiences market noise and psyches you out.  It takes out the emotional part of trading, and makes it numerical (which is more consistent).  This also helps you improve your chances of selling your winners before they are truly \"out of the game\".  Why am I mentioning all of this?  Determining this beforehand directly helps you size your positions accordingly.  I trade with each position risking 1-2% of my portfolio.  Meaning if it went completely wrong I would lose 1% of my entire portfolio on that trade.  This is a professionally recommended and utilized method.  How does this help?  Well lets take a look at an example.\n\n\n\n\nLets say you have a portfolio of $100,000;\n\n\n\nYour 1% risk per trade would be $1000.  So you could have a position of $10,000 that has a stop loss of 10%, representing a 1% total portfolio risk.  You could also have a position of $3750 with a 26.6% stop loss that represents the exact same risk.  The reason this is important is because it tells you that a volatile stock inherently deserves a smaller position size then a less volatile stock, because the potential for gain and risk are equally larger.  This is the first fundamental basis of safe portfolio development.  (Volatility can be measured as the standard deviation of a stock within a period of time, sometimes called return range, or risk).\n\n\n\nNow how do you determine the specific stop loss for each stock?  A few different ways.  I personally utilize software called TradeStops by Dr. Richard Smith, who developed an algorithm to determine a stock's individualized \"range\" that it trades in, and offers a stop loss directly outside that range.  If you weren't looking to get that hardcore into it, what you can also do is simply look at charts, and make a judgement based on the support levels.\n\n\nHeres two examples.  Looking at the chart for Mastercard (Ticker:  MA), you'll see a very smooth uptrend throughout the past two years.  This was a great returns, very low volatile play, and even survived the big dips in February and March without much volatility.  It has a daily standard deviation of about 2%, and a monthly deviation of about 8%.  My stop loss for a position on Mastercard would be around 16%.  If the position ever fell 16% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and it should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $6250 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .16  =  $6250\n\n\n\nSecond example.  Looking at the chart for Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA), you'll see another uptrend, but just not quite as smooth as MA.  This was also a play with great returns, but higher volatility, especially during the past three months.  NVDA has a daily standard deviation of about 3.02% and a monthly deviation of about 13.43%.  My stop loss for a position on NVDA would be around 28%.  If the position ever fell 28% from a high, you know there is some severe disruption in the health of the stock, and should be sold.  For an $100,000 portfolio, my position size would be $3571 to reflect that risk (divide your risk ($1000) by your stop loss).    $1000 / .28  =  $3571\n\n\n\nThese two examples show that while the returns of the stock can be similar, the volatility (risk) of each investment should be a significant factor in deciding how much to allocate.  You could have a LOT of small risky positions (speculator), or you could also have a mix of smaller riskier positions mixed with larger less risky positions and a spatter of diversification in between (investor).  I have done very successfully with this so far, currently returning an Alpha (against the SPY) of 7% YTD.

With how a lot of FOSS is designed the implementation details are exposed to the admins/operators which makes it harder to figure out what you're supposed to do. This leads to a steeper learning curve for the users meaning the upsell on training and support for incredibly novice users is high value. Paradoxically this also leads to a situation where the majority of your user base is now capable of self-support thus not needing paid support except as a sort of insurance policy for things like kernel bugs or fundamental driver issues. On the flip side, Windows customers still need support contracts for those same reasons as well.\n\nThere's a lot of paranoia that RH is intentionally making their product \"hard to use\" (whatever that means) to gin up demand for support but that's usually a short sighted criticism given the push to self-support I mentioned before. They would only be ginning up demand for support if system behavior varied radically and unpredictably . Not as in lacked uniformity but you legitimately couldn't trust any understand you tried to have about the system. \n\nBut that would be remarkably dysfunctional to the point where nobody could use it or if they did their business would fail hard. What you're left with is the current state where being \"harder\" doesn't appear to have an obvious benefit or liability associated with it for RH. The existence of companies like Google and Amazon (both independent of RH) seems to indicate that the customers themselves actually on the whole at least _benefit_ from the relationship with FOSS. You'd have to look at actual numbers to figure out which had better support characteristics on the whole though.
