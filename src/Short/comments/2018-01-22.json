As the price of a stock gets higher and higher, some investors may feel the price is too high for them to buy, or small investors may feel it is unaffordable. Splitting the stock brings the share price down to a more \"attractive\" level. The effect here is purely psychological. The actual value of the stock doesn't change one bit, but the lower stock price may affect the way the stock is perceived and therefore entice new investors. Splitting the stock also gives existing shareholders the feeling that they suddenly have more shares than they did before, and of course, if the prices rises, they have more stock to trade.\n\nAnother reason, and arguably a more logical one, for splitting a stock is to increase a stock's liquidity, which increases with the stock's number of outstanding shares. When stocks get into the hundreds of dollars per share, very large bid/ask spreads can result. A perfect example is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A\n), which has never had a stock split. Its bid/ask spread can often be over $100, and as of November 2013, its class A shares were trading at just over $173,000 each. \n\nNone of these reasons or potential effects agree with financial theory, however. If you ask a finance professor, he or she will likely tell you that splits are totally irrelevant - yet companies still do it. Splits are a good demonstration of how the actions of companies and the behaviors of investors do not always fall in line with financial theory. This very fact has opened up a wide and relatively new area of financial study called behavioral finance.\"\n\nInvestopedia.\n\nYou can argue that it might in some cases have a negative impact, but the claim that it has \"no impact whatsoever\" is simply wrong.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.03333333333333333, "submission_title": "Your favourite stocks for 2018", "submission_text": "Which stocks from your portfolio do you think will be the biggest growers?", "parent_text": "Stock splits have no impact to value whatsoever", "parent_score": 13, "parent_ratio": 0.23076923076923078}, {"time": 1516672633.0, "submission_id": "7s7lrz", "comment_id": "dt3d03s", "body": "is this sarcasm?", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.011111111111111112, "submission_title": "Your favourite stocks for 2018", "submission_text": "Which stocks from your portfolio do you think will be the biggest growers?", "parent_text": "Stock splits have no impact to value whatsoever", "parent_score": 13, "parent_ratio": 0.07692307692307693}, {"time": 1516679341.0, "submission_id": "7s7lrz", "comment_id": "dt3j66l", "body": "Why?

Gamers are very unhappy because they can't even buy GPUs because the mining community are buying them in bulk. It got so bad that Nvidia are asking companies to not sell in bulk in order to not alienate their core customers for that they had for decades. I have seen sites being posted here that showcase all of the latest and greatest GPUs being out of stock. Hence why there is such a powerful rally around Nvidia stock. This also means people who can't buy Nvidia cards are resorting to buying AMD cards instead. \n\nThen AMD's EYPC server chips are already great and reportedly doing well. And all of this contravesy around chips being a security breaches are... believe it or not a good thing in terms of sales. Consumers don't really have options other than Intel and AMD.

Gamers are very unhappy because they can't even buy GPUs because the mining community are buying them in bulk. It got so bad that Nvidia are asking companies to not sell in bulk in order to not alienate their core customers for that they had for decades. I have seen sites being posted here that showcase all of the latest and greatest GPUs being out of stock. Hence why there is such a powerful rally around Nvidia stock. This also means people who can't buy Nvidia cards are resorting to buying AMD cards instead. \n\nThen AMD's EYPC server chips are already great and reportedly doing well.

It's a spinoff consumer credit arm from GE. Their business is really quite simple - they offer white label credit cards (store brandable cards) to big retailers like Walmart, amazon, etc. They also offer other financial services but credit is the bread and butter. It pays a nice and growing dividend, has an almost monopoly in big US retail stores. They also just reached a big deal with $PYPL to acquire  $6.8 billion in receivables, including PayPal\u2019s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, which totaled approximately $5.8 billion in receivables. In short, they are expanding very rapidly and getting in on new technologies to further compound growth. The new tax cuts are going to be a big deal for people who use Synchrony's services, as well as piggybacking retailers they partner with doing better because of a lower corp tax rate. They also have sky high profit margins compared to peers, so return on capital is great. I started buying at about $26 ish, and have been adding to the position for the past 3 months.

I just don't see that happening but I'm more than happy to be wrong about that.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[AMD Weekly Chart](https://i.imgur.com/7gCVoQY.png)\n\n", "parent_text": "Well, if you want a couple of what I am currently buying / holding, I am happy to share, and why.\n\n$SYF - low price, cheap in fact, relative to it's consistent earnings. It's a spinoff consumer credit arm from GE. Their business is really quite simple - they offer white label credit cards (store brandable cards) to big retailers like Walmart, amazon, etc. They also offer other financial services but credit is the bread and butter. It pays a nice and growing dividend, has an almost monopoly in big US retail stores. They also just reached a big deal with $PYPL to acquire  $6.8 billion in receivables, including PayPal\u2019s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, which totaled approximately $5.8 billion in receivables. In short, they are expanding very rapidly and getting in on new technologies to further compound growth. The new tax cuts are going to be a big deal for people who use Synchrony's services, as well as piggybacking retailers they partner with doing better because of a lower corp tax rate. They also have sky high profit margins compared to peers, so return on capital is great. I started buying at about $26 ish, and have been adding to the position for the past 3 months. Turns out, Seth Klarman and Berkshire Hathaway also added SYF to their portfolios in the last quarter of 2017... if that means anything of value to you ;)\n\n$NVDA This one is real easy. Stupid profits, Extremely high return on invested capital, extreme moat around multiple industries. Artificial intelligence, self driving, automation, deep learning and data centre solutions, gaming, VR.... endless list. It's currently growing revenues at a scary rate. Foudner led, low debt, dividend already in place. It just so happens to be a bit of a pop-stock here on this sub for the reasons mentionned abouve, but I personally bought my first share at $20 many moons ago (admittedly a small position) and I am still buying today. The high P/E is scary but the price to sales and future growth potential to an already very profitable company are in my opinion very 'safe bets'.\n\nThat is it. Yes, I am only buying 2 stocks this year so far.

It is the current \u2018hot\u2019 topic in biotech as illustrated with the news that Celgene wants to buy Juno. T-cells are engineered from donors with healthy immune function and allow for delivery from inventory to patients in 3 to 5 days without a requirement for pretreatment. \n\nTheir current [pipeline](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/) is diverse. It includes [ATA129](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata129/) (a drug targeting cancer patients with rituximab-refractory Epstein-Barr virus and its variants), [ATA188](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata188/) (for the treatment of Multiple sclerosis), [ATA230](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata230/) (for CMV), [ATA520](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/ata520/) (Wilms tumor 1), [ATA621](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/preclinical-programs/)(BK virus (not that common)) and [ATA368](http://www.atarabio.com/pipeline/preclinical-programs/)(HPV). Most of the drugs are novel and cutting age and have pretty good results so far. [Here](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/56/2/277/837426) is a nice scientific article about the treatment of EBV, where no drug is found to target it specifically but ATA129 does.\n\nAs I type this out its currently $34.30 up 16.27% on the day and up from $18 since the start of 2018. So does this mean you have missed the run for the year? In my opinion, no. In fact this companies pipeline and potential make me think there is a lot left in the tank and I\u2019ll try and hash out the reasons why I think so.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n1. Diverse pipeline with cutting edge drugs developed from T-cell tech that is currently \u2018hot\u2019 in biotech (CART).\n\n2. ATA129, recently gone into [phase 3 trials](http://investors.atarabio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/atara-biotherapeutics-announces-initiation-two-phase-3-clinical), has [shown](https://ash.confex.com/ash/2017/webprogram/Paper107933.html) good results. There was an 80-100% objective response rate. In clinical trials, [\u201c\u2026Treatment with ATA129 resulted in one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in two separate clinical trials in comparison with historical data where median survival, or the time by which 50% of patients had died, was 16-56 days. In the setting of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after SOT, similar results were observed, with one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in ATA129-treated patients in comparison with an expected historical one-year survival of 36% in patients with high risk disease similar to the patients treated in the trials.\u201d](https://atarabio.gcs-web.com/node/9376/html#Balance_Sheets). It has showed efficacy and safety moving into phase 3 trials. This year Atara will submit a CMA for ATA129 with phase 3 data in 1Q 2019 and pursue a PDUFA 4Q 2019 or 1Q 2020.\n\n3. ATA129 collaboration with Merck\u2019s KEYTRUDA for nasopharyngeal carcinoma to be initiated this year. I have mentioned before how great this drug is but this drug is the [real deal.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180116005680/en/Mercks-KEYTRUDA-pembrolizumab-Significantly-Improved-Survival-Progression-Free). Apart from it being considered a [\u201c$16 billion drug](https://www.barrons.com/articles/merck-is-keytruda-a-16b-drug-1508351281) a collaboration into a [rare cancer](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/nasopharyngeal-cancer/statistics) with a proven drug in an area where no other such drug exists means a lot of money. \n\n4. ATA188 (currently in phase 2 safety and efficacy trials) showed [very promising]http://cme-utilities.com/mailshotcme/Abstracts/Oral-Program-Sessions-270317_2.pdf) data. Six of ten progressive MS patients in the Phase 1 trial experienced clinical improvements. Reduced fatigue was also reported (which if you know anything about MS, is a big deal). A secondary drug ATA190 is also being tested alongside ATA188 for EBV related MS showing a strong correlation.\n\n5. ATA520 recently [presented interim phase 1 results](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/98?sso-checked=true). The one year response was greater than 60%, two patients with complete responses remained in remission for one year and no adverse effects were recorded. AT520 has two phase 1 results (one on dose escalation safety, the other on dose escalation with drug resistant multiple myeloma) this year.\n\n6. Numerous triggers in 2018 including ATA230 phase 2 trial results [1Q 2018](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02136797), ATA520 phase 1 results [1Q 2018](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00620633) and [4Q2018](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01758328), Preclinical trial results from ATA621, ATA368 and ATA274 and keytruda combo initiation news. Not to mention the 2019 triggers that include phase 3 results for ATA129, ATA188 results, NDA submissions, licensing and partnership news.\n\n7. Recent PT upgrade to $70.\n\n**Cons**: \n\n1. Enormous amount of dumping lately with majority of insiders selling(-12%). That coupled with its recent run and RSI at 87 hints at an incoming correction. \n\n2. [Increasing debt ($261 million), increased operating activities and no current source of revenue](https://atarabio.gcs-web.com/node/9376/html#Balance_Sheets)\n\n3. Most drugs in development are in phase 2 or below.\n\n4. Support at $28.25\n\n\n**TL;DR**: This is a company with potential and something I\u2019ll keep my eye on.

Started working a real job a couple years ago, and my parents hooked me up with our long time Investors Group lady. Shortly after opening an account with them, monthly deposits and all, I began looking into stock trading and used extra money to dabble. I've been enjoying it thus far.  \n  \nNow, I recently got my 1/4ly statement from IG regarding my fund, which has a considerable amount of money now (for me) and it only netted me a $30 return in a conservative IG Mutual Fund.
