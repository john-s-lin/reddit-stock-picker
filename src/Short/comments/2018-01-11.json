(The Star)\n* Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube said it will remove popular American vlogger Logan Paul from its Google Preferred platform after a suicide video post. Paul apologized in a YouTube video titled \"So Sorry\" last week. (Reuters)\n* Hyundai Motor said today it had invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab.

There were other factors at play, for example low price of alternative resources (oil, etc) that could substitute for solar. \n\nFirst Solar has a couple of competitive advantages: 1) it\u2019s technology is different from other solar producers, 2) the company has a massive amount of cash and cash equivalents, and 3) the management team has executed well on its strategy. \n\nSince the low, much has changed for FSLR (note that I still think the low was a result of way undervaluing FSLR by the market, hence why I bought in), the new administration is seeking a tariff on solar imports. I highly recommend reviewing this as it could have large implications in the US solar industry. Many believe it will lead to less investment, but still benefit FSLR as they will be seen as the best supplier. Additionally, they have continued to have stronger than expected sales on Series 4. \n\nRisks are still prevalent. Although the Series 6 is coming along well according to management, there is a chance that it will not sell well. I believe that is a low risk since they are still selling Series 4 well. Another risk is that Series 6 could flop, as in not meet the metrics that were desired. This would greatly impact future sales projections, but I also believe Series 4 can continue to be sold, just not as well as Series 6 will. \n\nOutside competitors and new technology is also a risk, but FSLR has a great product and good R&D that i think they can stay ahead of that. \n\nTariffs may also not go through. Many think this will lower FSLRs value. But I believe they are priced well currently and can continue to compete against foreign competitors. \n\nOverall, they are a great company with strong potential. There are risks, but I don\u2019t see them being any more risky than many other businesses. I think in the long term they will continue to return shareholder value. \n\nWith that said, I think Mr. Market is going to take one final chop at the price. Two reasons why it may happen: 1) Q4 EPS is still in the $0-$2 range and/or 3) tariffs are not implemented. \n\nNeither of those scare me and if the price dips I may accumulate more. 1) is expected as Series 4 rolls off and Series 6 is on the horizon, but Mr Market hates low earnings. As I said above, I don\u2019t view 2) as a strong threat. \n\nHopes this helps and happy to discuss my views further.
