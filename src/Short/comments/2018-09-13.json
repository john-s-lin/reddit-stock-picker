A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

(OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

(OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

(OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant. Most patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved AEDs.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  FN Media Group LLC. owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com (FNM) and MarketNewsUpdates.com (MNU) is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.

(OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors.

Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors.

A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.   Active companies in the Cannabis markets this week include Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC:NUGS),  Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG), Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH).\n\nCannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

I think most ETFs have TLRY in them, and have a larger % of the investment in TLRY over the other plays. A pull back on TLRY at this point would be a pullback on all plays, which is not what we want. Fund managers are not going to start putting their investments into the stronger plays so long as TLRY keeps moving +10% daily. TLRY keeps moving +10% daily because investors are moving into the ETFs instead of direct stock buys.

VW is already the market leader in China, and they are planning their ID line of electric vehicles to launch in 2020. They could very well blow away Nio by producing cheaper, reliable cars.

Please do your own DD. \n\nJust wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume. \n\nSSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called. \n\nThe first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.\n\nSo, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though. \n\nWith this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI. \n\nSo, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD. If you are long though, I think any time is a good time to get in. The market cap is only at 650Million, and if we extrapolate the chicago contract out to other cities, it becomes obvious that there is a lot of room for growth. The company increased 52% in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and they were on the cusp of being profitable.

Please do your own DD. \n\nJust wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume. \n\nSSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called. \n\nThe first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.\n\nSo, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though. \n\nWith this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI. \n\nSo, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD.

Please do your own DD. \n\nJust wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume. \n\nSSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called. \n\nThe first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.\n\nSo, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though. \n\nWith this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI. \n\nSo, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD. If you are long though, I think any time is a good time to get in. The market cap is only at 650Million, and if we extrapolate the chicago contract out to other cities, it becomes obvious that there is a lot of room for growth. The company increased 52% in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and they were on the cusp of being profitable.

This stock as near it's 52 week high, so if you are not a long buyer, be weary of a pullback. Please do your own DD. \n\nJust wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume. \n\nSSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called. \n\nThe first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.\n\nSo, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though. \n\nWith this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI. \n\nSo, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD.

So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.\n\nSo, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though. \n\nWith this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI. \n\nSo, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD. If you are long though, I think any time is a good time to get in. The market cap is only at 650Million, and if we extrapolate the chicago contract out to other cities, it becomes obvious that there is a lot of room for growth. The company increased 52% in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and they were on the cusp of being profitable.

You say the hype is priced in, but you also have to consider there is tremendous skepticism and doubt priced in too. If the Model 3 becomes profitable, I have to believe the pressure from shorts will significantly weaken. I think if you want to bet against Tesla, short term put options are the best bet. If Tesla doesn't go bankrupt within the next 2 quarters, I don't see them going bankrupt at all. And at its current price, shorting could be disastrous. One piece of good news regarding Model 3 production could send the stock back up to $360 in no time.
