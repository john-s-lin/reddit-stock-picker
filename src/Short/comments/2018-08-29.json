Looking at historical data, even if you invested in 2007-2008 right before the market crashed, Nasdaq wasn't much more volatile than S&P500 where Nasdaq tanked 42% and S&P tanked 38.5%.   \n2) Your initial investments made in 2008 would have net you a 280% return by 2018 vs 97% if it were in S&P500.  \n3) Nasdaq recovered better from the crash 2008 than S&P500\n\n4) Investing at the all time highs during the dot.com bubble is the only time frame where you would be worse off investing in Nasdaq vs S&P500.  Now ask yourself, is the top 100 companies significantly over valued compared to the top 500 companies?  If yes, then maybe S&P500 is safer.\n\nFinally, yes I know historical data doesn't prove anything...but we need some basis to go off when deciding where to put our money...so I ask, why did you put your investments into S&P500 over Nasdaq 100?\n", "parent_text": "As someone who has moved out of poverty, I cannot express strongly enough how upsetting this line of thinking is.

Amazon is the number 1 go-to online retailer for the majority of people and that number and majority and share of the market place is only growing. What other companies are legitimately challenging Amazon now more than before?\n\nEveryone thinks that just because Amazon has grown so fast in a short period of time that it's just bound to stop.

Let me know why you think their growth 10 years ago will end of being better or the same than right now. I'm not asking to give reasons why it won't maintain its 100% rise because that's pretty crazy, I'm just asking why you think it won't even reach its AVERAGE during the next 5 years.

It would only need to average 40% to hit 10k a share in 5 years. Do you honestly believe its annual average will drop 10% lower than its previous decade annual average over the next 5 years?

Might not grow and experience at the pace we\u2019ve seen in 2017/2018 but there should still be room for some solid returns for the patient investor. It\u2019s a solid company selling a service that is likely to only grow as we rely less and less on cash transactions.\n\nShort term? I think is too risky. Square has had an incredible run up and I think it\u2019s likely due for some sort of correction, likely temporary, in the near future. I\u2019m not predicting anything major but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it drop 5-7% over the course of a week or two sometime over the next couple months.\n\nSquare basically has two major obstacles they have to overcome. The first (as with many companies) is working on and improving their finances (which should come in time) and keeping them sound once this explosive growth slows down. These numbers are for the most part getting better and they\u2019re inching closer to seeing positive bottom lines. The second and probably more difficult obstacle is dealing with competition. Square offers a great service but I\u2019m not sure how strong it\u2019s MOAT really is. Could companies like Apple, Google, or Visa offer something similar? Something potentially better or cheaper? They\u2019ve been fairly quiet thus far but if I\u2019m Square those are giants I would be constantly worrying about and trying to develop ways to maintain an edge over.\n\nI hold Square, it\u2019s been one of my best performers and is a company I plan on holding it for a long time.
