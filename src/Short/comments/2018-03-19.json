Owning Instagram is big, data collection and advertising can be like gold, and as much as I dislike him Zuckerberg and his team has proven themselves more than capable leaders. It\u2019s dropped around 7-8% since last week but is still up nearly 25% from a year ago. Thus I have set a fairly low buying point of $160 as it\u2019s certainly not a company at the top of my buying list but a potential 12-15% drop in just a few weeks is certainly enticing for a relatively stable company.\n\nMy thoughts are that something is going to happen to them penalty/punishment wise. However it will be no where as extreme or harsh as some people are speculating. People also forget fast and some simply don\u2019t care or value their privacy sadly. We\u2019ve also seen the fairly lenient punishment imposed on a company like Equifax.
