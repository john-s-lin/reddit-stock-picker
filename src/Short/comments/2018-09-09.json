It was a while ago now and I don't think the situation is the same now as it was then with the economics of battery production changing quickly these days.\n\nRegardless, just because Tesla figures out a way to do this profitably doesn't necessarily mean that other manufacturers will be able to copy it. Tesla is spending a lot on R&D specific to these types of vehicles, and securing battery production second to none. I think saying \"we'll just copy them and do it in 12 months\" is a gross oversimplification of what would need to happen and just isn't possible, and this gives Tesla a unique advantage.\n\nI think you're right when you say manufacturers aren't trying to copy Tesla right now, overall. But I do think the market is moving this direction very slowly, and early investments and movement will be very useful in the future. Tesla will need to get through the storm before those really pay off vs their competitors, but I think they will. Teardowns show margins on the Model 3 are very good once they get their production figured out, and it seems like they're mostly out of the woods there. They've gone through this on the Model S and X lines in the past and now those run smoothly and more profitably than when those launched, and I think the Model 3 is either on the cusp of being in the same place, or perhaps already there.\n\nI can't predict the future and Tesla may not make it, but I have high long term expectations for them even if there is some more potential downside in the short term.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 152, "submission_ratio": 0.006578947368421052, "submission_title": "Do you feel that TSLA still has room to drop; or should I just buy in now, as I'm a going long?", "submission_text": "I've been wanting to drop a substantial amount of money onto TSLA, however many of my peers and redditors told me to wait for a decent price.   \n\nI bought in at 259, but I wonder if it has room to drop.
