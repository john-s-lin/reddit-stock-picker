But I was in the US a few months ago (when I wasn't investing), and even though I had heard about SQ a few years ago (I saw the design of their first product, THE square, on the internet). However, I had forgotten about the company, until I was there. There were so many small (and not so small) businesses using a variety of their products.\n\nFrom what I have seen there, and later, on the Internet, I have the feeling that they're the Apple of the POS systems. Everything, from the design of their products, to the ecosystem they're building (Sarah Friar explained this quite well on Mad Money).

But I couldn't resist buying at $66. There is no single stock I am more bullish on, and at this count, I had to average down.\n\nThere is, obviously, a lot about SQ that makes people nervous. But I broke down my reasons for why this sell-off doesn't worry me a few days ago in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9rw2cp/sq/e8k8t8v/):\n\n> The stock is still almost 100% YTD, and I believe it has great times ahead. There are several factors which caused the 30% drop:\n\n> - It reached $100, which I think was a target of many investors, who  took their profits. This is probably a very minor cause.\n> - Sarah Friar, the current CFO, announced she is leaving soon to become a CEO of Nextdoor. She was a crucial part of the management, and she played a huge role in Square's terrific growth. She was an amazing CFO, and her leaving will definitely impact Square's future. However, there was, I believe, a huge overreaction for this event - many believe that she is jumping ship, because of her insider info. To me, that seems ridiculous. She left amicably and this seems like an obvious step up in her career, she is becoming a CEO. If she left to become a CFO of another company, I would be worried.\n> - The CEO, Jack Dorsey has been selling some of his shares in the last few weeks. It is obvious why that would worry investors, but seeing how much the stock has grown, it is reasonable to understand that Dorsey would sell some of his shares. He is a billionaire and a shareholder like everyone else. Of course he needs to rebalance his portfolio sometimes, even as a shareholder of his own company. Also, his sales must be announced months ahead, so it isn't reasonable to think that he is selling because of the earnings of this quarter, or Friar leaving.\n> - The market is in correction, the tech stocks, especially the ones that grew the fastest are of course the first ones that investors sell to take profits.\n> - As the stock price was falling, many stop loss sell orders were triggered, causing the SP dropping even lower.\n\n> Each of these factors combined caused a huge sell-off. I, personally, don't think the reasons I have been buying Square are changed by any of these factors. Square has been very consistently beating expectations, they're building a great ecosystem for businesses, they're working on tons of new stuff. The only thing that really matters among these factors is who will replace Friar, but I believe that they will pick the right person.\n\n> Really, all things considered, I don't see why this discount isn't a great time to buy in. I am very bullish on this one, long term.\n\nTry to look up some videos about their products, you will see how great they are. They have a YouTube channel, that might help.
