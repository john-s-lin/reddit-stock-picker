Please bear with me.\n\n\n\nLesson 1:\nI started taking a keen interest in markets in 2012.\nMy trading and investment decisions were based on stock recommendations offered\u00a0by analysts on TV channels.\n\nThe returns generated were decent. I truly wondered why people thought trading/investing was difficult. I thought I had discovered the recipe for success in stock markets. It was easy. It required little effort from my end. All I had to do was imitate the analyst\u2019s stock pick.\n\n\nThings were great. Until one day. The stock picks recommended for intraday started failing. It was unfathomable to me that I was losing so much money. I resorted to revenge trading. Lost\u00a0even more money.\n\n\nWhatever profits I had generated were evaporated in a relatively short duration. I could\u2019ve never imagined such an outcome.\nIn hindsight I should\u2019ve thought that there\u2019s never a free lunch. Why would anyone offer their stock picks without anything in return?\n\nLesson: Trust no one blindly. Assess, examine trading/ investment decisions.\n\nEvery action of assistance, guidance towards us in the stock market should be looked at with glasses of cynicism. It\u2019s a brutal place.\n\n\n\nLesson 2:\nOn a popular stock app there\u2019s a bustling interaction medium. Stock picks are often offered for free and people wax eloquent about the tremendous potential the company possesses to multiply our wealth.\n\n\nI came across one such message recommending investment in an investment company. It\u2019d be inappropriate to share the stock pick.\n\n\nThe stock was described as being at the cusp of a great transition to being a large cap company. Messages loaded with superlatives describing the management bombarded the board. It seemed like the ideal investment opportunity.\n\n\nI trusted them and invested 10 % of my portfolio.\nThe stock went from X to 3X in 5 months.\nMy happiness knew no bounds. I was ecstatic.\nI continued averaging at upper levels expecting even more upside.\n\n\nOne day, the stock began its downward slide. Lower circuit after lower circuit. Surveillance measures were taken by the exchange and moved to 5% circuit. The fall was excruciating. It stopped when it reached 1.5 X.\n\n\nI continued to average. Since, I had purchased heavily at upper levels my average price became very high. Losses incurred were significant. The fall wasn\u2019t arrested yet. It kept falling. The stock formed 35% of my portfolio.\n\n\nMy portfolio was painted in red. There was little chance the stock would regain its past glory. I had to book my losses. It dawned on me that the stock move was a meticulously engineered operation by bigger investors.\n I had invested by trusting someone else.\n\n\nLesson 2: If possible avoid excessive concentration in any stock pick. Conditions can deteriorate at any point.\nIntroduce adequate safeguards to protect profits.\n\n\nBooking profits will reduce cost of carry.\nIt was my greed that destroyed my portfolio.\nIt\u2019s difficult to tame greed but those who succeeed at doing so will likely emerge victorious in the market.\n\n\n\n\nLesson 3:\nIn 2016, I came across a petrochemical company which was showing some signs of a turnaround.\nImposition of an anti dumping duty was expected which would enable an improvement  in the company\u2019s financials.\n\n\nI invested based on this thesis. Management seemed to be decent. I invested 15% of my portfolio. It was my first turnaround investment.\n\n\nWhen the results were declared the turnaround wasn\u2019t very convincing. Instead of waiting and appreciating that turnarounds take time I exited my holdings.\n\n\nI had purchased at X. I exited at 1.3 X. A 30 % profit. It seemed a healthy return to me in 3-4 months.\nThe same company, in the next 7 quarters underwent an extraordinary turnaround. From losses to double digit profit margins. And, the stock went from X to 5X.\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I blamed my luck and derived solace that I had some profit. But, heart of hearts I knew I had made a massive error of judgement.\n\n\nLesson: Be patient. If you\u2019re convinced about a stock after enough research stay invested for some time. Investments take time to mature, to grow.\nIn investments without conviction profit booking would be sensible. But, if enough conviction has been developed- Be patient, do nothing.\n\n\nSometimes inactivity is better than activity.\nHere, I was a victim of fear of losing money.

And, it has cost me a lot.\nStock trading/ investing is an incredibly complicated activity. There are so many variables involved that it\u2019s difficult for linear thinkers like us to piece the information and take rational decisions.\n\n\n\nTo simplify the task, we resort to substituting difficult questions for easy ones.\nInstead of analyzing a company based on its financials I\u2019ll check if I like the product manufactured by that company and invest based on that.\n\n\nI\u2019ve succumbed to it often.\nAnd, needless to say, I lost money.\nAlso, being rigid is harmful to us.\nDespite knowing that a strategy doesn\u2019t work, I refused to accept it.

I personally believe this is what people like Buffett mean when he's says everyone should stick to index funds in that most people don't have the traits to do it successfully.  \n\nHowever, if you're willing to truly put in the time to research the companies then yes, I think it's worthwhile to invest in individual companies. It's just the research involves more than reading a few Motley Fool articles, you have to actually read and listen to the reports, compare them with competition, see what external factors can influence the business, and so on. Most people aren't willing to do that or don't know how to do that.\n\nI personally do both.

I'm a resident of India. Hence, some terms may seem foreign. Please bear with me.\n\n\n\nLesson 1:\nI started taking a keen interest in markets in 2012.\nMy trading and investment decisions were based on stock recommendations offered\u00a0by analysts on TV channels.\n\nThe returns generated were decent. I truly wondered why people thought trading/investing was difficult. I thought I had discovered the recipe for success in stock markets. It was easy. It required little effort from my end. All I had to do was imitate the analyst\u2019s stock pick.\n\n\nThings were great. Until one day. The stock picks recommended for intraday started failing. It was unfathomable to me that I was losing so much money. I resorted to revenge trading. Lost\u00a0even more money.\n\n\nWhatever profits I had generated were evaporated in a relatively short duration. I could\u2019ve never imagined such an outcome.\nIn hindsight I should\u2019ve thought that there\u2019s never a free lunch. Why would anyone offer their stock picks without anything in return?\n\nLesson: Trust no one blindly. Assess, examine trading/ investment decisions.\n\nEvery action of assistance, guidance towards us in the stock market should be looked at with glasses of cynicism. It\u2019s a brutal place.\n\n\n\nLesson 2:\nOn a popular stock app there\u2019s a bustling interaction medium. Stock picks are often offered for free and people wax eloquent about the tremendous potential the company possesses to multiply our wealth.\n\n\nI came across one such message recommending investment in an investment company. It\u2019d be inappropriate to share the stock pick.\n\n\nThe stock was described as being at the cusp of a great transition to being a large cap company. Messages loaded with superlatives describing the management bombarded the board. It seemed like the ideal investment opportunity.\n\n\nI trusted them and invested 10 % of my portfolio.\nThe stock went from X to 3X in 5 months.\nMy happiness knew no bounds. I was ecstatic.\nI continued averaging at upper levels expecting even more upside.\n\n\nOne day, the stock began its downward slide. Lower circuit after lower circuit. Surveillance measures were taken by the exchange and moved to 5% circuit. The fall was excruciating. It stopped when it reached 1.5 X.\n\n\nI continued to average. Since, I had purchased heavily at upper levels my average price became very high. Losses incurred were significant. The fall wasn\u2019t arrested yet. It kept falling. The stock formed 35% of my portfolio.\n\n\nMy portfolio was painted in red. There was little chance the stock would regain its past glory. I had to book my losses. It dawned on me that the stock move was a meticulously engineered operation by bigger investors.\n I had invested by trusting someone else.\n\n\nLesson 2: If possible avoid excessive concentration in any stock pick. Conditions can deteriorate at any point.\nIntroduce adequate safeguards to protect profits.\n\n\nBooking profits will reduce cost of carry.\nIt was my greed that destroyed my portfolio.\nIt\u2019s difficult to tame greed but those who succeeed at doing so will likely emerge victorious in the market.\n\n\n\n\nLesson 3:\nIn 2016, I came across a petrochemical company which was showing some signs of a turnaround.\nImposition of an anti dumping duty was expected which would enable an improvement  in the company\u2019s financials.\n\n\nI invested based on this thesis. Management seemed to be decent. I invested 15% of my portfolio. It was my first turnaround investment.\n\n\nWhen the results were declared the turnaround wasn\u2019t very convincing. Instead of waiting and appreciating that turnarounds take time I exited my holdings.\n\n\nI had purchased at X. I exited at 1.3 X. A 30 % profit. It seemed a healthy return to me in 3-4 months.\nThe same company, in the next 7 quarters underwent an extraordinary turnaround. From losses to double digit profit margins. And, the stock went from X to 5X.\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I blamed my luck and derived solace that I had some profit. But, heart of hearts I knew I had made a massive error of judgement.\n\n\nLesson: Be patient. If you\u2019re convinced about a stock after enough research stay invested for some time. Investments take time to mature, to grow.\nIn investments without conviction profit booking would be sensible. But, if enough conviction has been developed- Be patient, do nothing.\n\n\nSometimes inactivity is better than activity.\nHere, I was a victim of fear of losing money. Hence, sold too early.\nFear and greed are major causes of bad decisions.\n\n\n\nLesson 4:\nAn important lesson I learned is appreciating the role of luck and the limitations of our expertise.\n\n\nI have often mistaken my luck for skill. And, it has cost me a lot.\nStock trading/ investing is an incredibly complicated activity. There are so many variables involved that it\u2019s difficult for linear thinkers like us to piece the information and take rational decisions.\n\n\n\nTo simplify the task, we resort to substituting difficult questions for easy ones.\nInstead of analyzing a company based on its financials I\u2019ll check if I like the product manufactured by that company and invest based on that.\n\n\nI\u2019ve succumbed to it often.\nAnd, needless to say, I lost money.\nAlso, being rigid is harmful to us.\nDespite knowing that a strategy doesn\u2019t work, I refused to accept it. I suffered from the illusion of validity.\n\n\nAcceptance is crucial for success.\nMost factors are beyond our control. Frankly, there\u2019s hardly anything in our control.\n\n\nI stopped thinking of myself as a person who has everything in control and accepted the fact that I was at the mercy of variables I could do nothing about.\nThis change in behavior, approach helped me.\nI started appreciating the contribution of luck in success.\n\n\nFrom where we\u2019re born, the upbringing we receive , the socioeconomic status are rarely in our control.\nAnd,these factors play an instrumental role in moulding the future behavioral patterns of a person.\n\n\nLesson 4: The lesson I learned is that I should shed my delusion of being in control and acknowledge that despite my best efforts there will be consequences totally opposite to my expectations.\n\n\n\nLesson 5:\nThe most important lesson I learned is that I should have realistic expectations.\nStock markets aren\u2019t get rich quick schemes.\nIt\u2019s a way to participate in the growth story of a real business.\n\n\nFor an ordinary person like me it\u2019s impossible to sustain 20% CAGR for long durations.\nI tempered my expectations to 10-11% over the long term.\n\n\nAfter all, what causes pain- When expectations are not met we suffer from pain, grief.\nSolution is to have low expectations. If the outcome is better than our expectations our joy will be indescribable.\n\nI humbly share the lessons I\u2019ve learned. This forum has played an instrumental role in my growth as a person.

I've realised that there's always something to learn.\nYet again, my gratitude to all.\nMy apologies if I\u2019ve erred.\nBest wishes.\n", "parent_text": "I understand that. But in your opinion, do you think most people who do put the time end up beating the market? From my understanding (and apparently many successful and professional investors seem to agree), most people who try to beat the market are unsuccessful just because of how much the odds tend to be stacked against you. On the other hand, do to the luck factor, you could randomly pick stocks and end up picking up the next Apple or Amazon and crush the market. I'm not 100% sure of this, but I faintly recall reading an article about a study done that on average people who randomly picked stocks out of a certain pool of stocks (might have been S&P 500 companies) on average did almost as well/just as well as people who actually did their research (this is probably excluding people like Warren Buffet though and probably just refers to \"normal\" investors who do their research). I guess in a way what I'm trying to say is that barring a very small percentage of the population, most people just won't be able to beat the market (for various reasons) even after doing their research. I guess the argument could be made that they didn't do their research well enough, but how many people can realistically do research and evaluate companies as well as famous investors like Warren Buffet anyways?
