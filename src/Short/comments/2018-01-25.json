I just bought a hedge, and the fact that it went down on the news when the entire market went up is stupid luck.

Likely can sell it right from there, or do something better - get the account info and move it to a real brokerage account.\n\nWhat you can do, is transfer via what's called an ACATS (Account transfer without selling the security) from that ESOP into a brokerage account you control directly. Then either keep that and do some of your non-IRA investing / savings in that account:  A brokerage account can buy money market funds, FDIC-insured CDs, short-term bond funds almost like money markets, things suitable even for an emergency fund, not just \"investing.\" And many brokerages also offer banking-alternative checking attached to it. \n\nOr sell it, turn it into cash, and if you chose, buy shares in an overall  equity index fund (or ETF index fund), or target date fund, at that same broker. \n\nEven the free brokerages that are app-primary like Robinhood or M1 should let you do that ACATs in. Or a low-commission broker like Fidelity or Schwab may be better if you want to also open an IRA/RothIRA to do other investing as well.

Long story short after quitting I never looked back at that account until today where I now have an individual account with about $350 all in BBY. Can anyone lead me into the right direction as to what I should do with this? I have never done any investing or trading but I know there's a wealth of information and I would gladly start learning. Do you guys think there's potential for me to turn such a small amount into something meaningful? I had no idea this money existed for the last 9 years so I'm willing to actually do something with it for the next 9 if there's real potential.
