Let's throw market sentiment out the window, and explore the mathematical impact of a buyback from a purely technical point of view.\n\nFirst, a company is exactly worth its net assets + its discounted future earnings.\n\nCompany A has 10 shares outstanding valued at $10 each. Therefore, it is worth $100.\n\nShare Price = (Net Assets + Future Earnings) / Shares Outstanding\n\nIn our example: 10 = (Net Assets + Future Earnings ) / 10\n\nLooking at the equation above, buying back the stock has two effects:\n\nA. Decreases net assets by 50 by spending cash.\n\nB. Decreases shares outstanding by 5.\n\nLet's say that future earnings did not exist. This means that the company is worth exactly the amount of current assets. Therefore, a buyback would imply no change in share price (50+0)/5 = $10.\n\nHowever, future earnings do exist! As long as future earnings is positive (above zero in the previous equation), the stock price has nowhere to move but upwards.\n\nWhat this all means: **Although each share is entitled to exactly less amount of assets the company used to repurchase shares, this is more than offset by the fact that each share is entitled to a greater portion of their future earnings. Therefore, share price increases.**\n\nHowever, I am very confused with the role that treasury stock plays in this. The above example only works because I assumed that repurchasing shares decreases the value of the company by 50. But does it? As /u/PM_ME_BOOBPIX pointed out, the company is still worth $100 after the buyback since it \"owns\" the 5 shares that they repurchased. It merely exchanged cash for assets. In a way, the company is giving those repurchased shares to the current shareholders. Therefore, the company is still worth $100 with 5 shares outstanding, raising the share price to $20.\n\nThis logic is very paradoxical/recursive, so it is very confusing. It means that the 5 shares are entitled to $100 in value, $50 being the 5 repurchased shares. One price is calculated based on total shares outstanding before, but the other is calculated based on shares outstanding after, even though they are the same shares? Is that sort of inconsistency even allowed? **Also, how can you say you own an additional $50 worth of assets here (the repurchased shares), when actually selling those shares causes you to own less (dilution)? How can you possibly say you got richer (i.e you own more per share), when selling those shares would literally decrease your net worth since you own shares now worth $10 again.**\n\n**In this interpretation, only effect B exists, so the share price MUST go up provided that the numerator is positive. There is literally no change in the value of the company, you just own a greater piece of the pie.**\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, the company has $50 less in cash. Yes, they technically do have the 5 repurchased shares that they can sell for $50, but does that even matter? Repurchased shares or not, the company always had the power to sell more shares anyways. Those \"assets\" only exist in theory and only come to fruition if they sell those shares. So why would only that $50 repurchased shares be priced in to your assets? You might as well then price in the theoretical maximum amount of money the company can raise by issuing millions and millions of shares. What would be the difference between selling those repurchased shares and issuing new shares to raise cash? I guess the only difference would be that those repurchased shares are worth more since it would be issued at a smaller initial number of shares outstanding. But the point stands.\n\nThinking about this is just getting me more confused. The last paragraph is most likely gibberish, and I have no idea what I'm talking about anymore. Maybe I'm just stupid.\n\n/u/uh_no_", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 52, "submission_ratio": 0.019230769230769232, "submission_title": "Am I understanding buybacks correctly?", "submission_text": "At first, I was confused as to how it would increase the share price.\n\nConsider an extremely simple scenario:\n\nSay a company is worth $100 with 10 shares oustanding ($10 per share).\n\nThe company buys back 5 shares (loses $50), so the company is now worth $50 with 5 shares oustanding.

Therefore, the price per share increases.**\n\nAm I thinking about this correctly? What am I missing?", "parent_text": "This is where I am currently at with my understanding. Let's throw market sentiment out the window, and explore the mathematical impact of a buyback from a purely technical point of view.\n\nFirst, a company is exactly worth its net assets + its discounted future earnings.\n\nCompany A has 10 shares outstanding valued at $10 each. Therefore, it is worth $100.\n\nShare Price = (Net Assets + Future Earnings) / Shares Outstanding\n\nIn our example: 10 = (Net Assets + Future Earnings ) / 10\n\nLooking at the equation above, buying back the stock has two effects:\n\nA. Decreases net assets by 50 by spending cash.\n\nB. Decreases shares outstanding by 5.\n\nLet's say that future earnings did not exist. This means that the company is worth exactly the amount of current assets. Therefore, a buyback would imply no change in share price (50+0)/5 = $10.\n\nHowever, future earnings do exist! As long as future earnings is positive (above zero in the previous equation), the stock price has nowhere to move but upwards.\n\nWhat this all means: **Although each share is entitled to exactly less amount of assets the company used to repurchase shares, this is more than offset by the fact that each share is entitled to a greater portion of their future earnings. Therefore, share price increases.**\n\nHowever, I am very confused with the role that treasury stock plays in this. The above example only works because I assumed that repurchasing shares decreases the value of the company by 50. But does it? As /u/PM_ME_BOOBPIX pointed out, the company is still worth $100 after the buyback since it \"owns\" the 5 shares that they repurchased. It merely exchanged cash for assets. In a way, the company is giving those repurchased shares to the current shareholders. Therefore, the company is still worth $100 with 5 shares outstanding, raising the share price to $20.\n\nThis logic is very paradoxical/recursive, so it is very confusing. It means that the 5 shares are entitled to $100 in value, $50 being the 5 repurchased shares. One price is calculated based on total shares outstanding before, but the other is calculated based on shares outstanding after, even though they are the same shares? Is that sort of inconsistency even allowed? **Also, how can you say you own an additional $50 worth of assets here (the repurchased shares), when actually selling those shares causes you to own less (dilution)? How can you possibly say you got richer (i.e you own more per share), when selling those shares would literally decrease your net worth since you own shares now worth $10 again.**\n\n**In this interpretation, only effect B exists, so the share price MUST go up provided that the numerator is positive. There is literally no change in the value of the company, you just own a greater piece of the pie.**\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, the company has $50 less in cash. Yes, they technically do have the 5 repurchased shares that they can sell for $50, but does that even matter? Repurchased shares or not, the company always had the power to sell more shares anyways. Those \"assets\" only exist in theory and only come to fruition if they sell those shares. So why would only that $50 repurchased shares be priced in to your assets? You might as well then price in the theoretical maximum amount of money the company can raise by issuing millions and millions of shares. What would be the difference between selling those repurchased shares and issuing new shares to raise cash? I guess the only difference would be that those repurchased shares are worth more since it would be issued at a smaller initial number of shares outstanding. But the point stands.\n\nThinking about this is just getting me more confused. The last paragraph is most likely gibberish, and I have no idea what I'm talking about anymore.

Biotech stock, makes heart monitors and is currently partnered with apple for their apple heart study.\n\nTeledoc (TDOC). Tele-health service. people can talk to doctors online to get Rx, advice, etc. They use their smartphone, or computer. The new sensors in watches, phones, etc are enabling more and more medicine to be able to be done online. This is growing stock and I expect them to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\nEcolabs (ECL). Set it and forget it stock (just like ron popeil says) if you wanna hold something for the next 10 years.

Its not a play for me right now but I think the company will continue to be around and find its space. I will offer some personal testimony, how my perception of the company has changed and some analysis I came across. So take this for what its worth. Skip this if you own Lulu products, not interested in my insights or could care less. Hopefully this resonates but if not, oh well. \n\nPersonally, I can't say I knew much about Lulu prior to this summer beyond the brand they had built. Expensive yoga clothing for women. In the past year my perception of the company has slowly changed along with the prospect of what they could be. Fairly recently, I found out Lulu is massive with professional hockey players (likely amateurs too). NHL players typically have thousands of stipend dollars to spend on Lulu products every year through their teams (I know its a Canadian company but who knew!). I also bought a couple of pairs Lulu mens pants to wear to work, that may or may not have been discounted (In case you're wonder it was still pricey). They are definitely more casual than your traditional work pant and I would not wear them to an important meeting but the product is absolutely unbelievable. Extremely comfortable, functional to the point where I could do squats at a gym and sharp enough for a business casual office setting. I knew Lulu was a higher end product but I was absolutely blown away. I am certainly no expert in this field but my take away is they seem to have a unique products that are ahead of the curve. Its unclear to me if they can keep this up in the long term because there doesn't seem to be a large economic moat as well as large players in the apparel playing field. Side note: The pants come in different colors and waist sizes. The inseams are all the same and I had to bring them in to a lulu store to be hemmed. It is an interesting move from an operations or production stand point and also gets customers in the store.\n\nPersonal optimistic view: continue to perform well in women's athletic apparel, make more of a splash in mens athletic apparel, and find its place into other environments as society is accepting more casual and functional clothing (work place, travel etc.). I also think they need to find ways to bring their price point down a bit more while still maintaining their brand as high end\n\nPersonal Pessimistic View: Its a fad with no moat and they get eaten up by larger apparel companies.\n\n\n\n\nBulls Say\nLululemon\u2019s unique grassroots marketing, use of\nambassadors, mobile app, and community-based\ninteractive stores create a loyal customer base.\nOWith only 70 stores outside North America at the\nend of 2017, there is a long runway for geographic\nexpansion in international markets. Expansion of the\nmen's line should also drive additional square\nfootage growth.\nOA higher proportion of sales through the ecommerce\nchannel can boost operating margin to a\nlow-20s level over the next decade (from 19% in\n2017) and give the company greater geographic\nreach.\n\n\n\nBears Say\nOThe active apparel market is flooding with\ncompetition, much of which has large cash reserves\nand a strong supply chain for quick R&D, product\ndevelopment, and geographic expansion.\nOLululemon has been propped up by consumers\u2019\npenchant for athleisure wear, and we believe sales\nwill suffer as this trend loses steam.\nOWe think further pricing power would be difficult\nto achieve, limiting the likelihood gross margin will\nexpand materially beyond the roughly 53% level seen\nin 2017.\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "LULU?", "submission_text": "I remember doing a paper on Lululemon Athletica\u2019s stocks about a year ago and their stock price was somewhere around the $60s.
