", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1523667282.0, "submission_id": "8c2ekn", "comment_id": "dxbxoa8", "body": "Great question. First off, I\u2019ll say that I\u2019d take Visa any day of the week over Discover if I had to pick between the two companies in terms of investing. I\u2019ll also admit that I didn\u2019t realize just how much larger and faster Visa grew into comparison to Discover. I knew they had the edge but did not know it was that great. Wow!\n\nWhy do I like Discover? I think the last year or so Discover has really shown it\u2019s serious in competing with the big credit companies and wants to finally move on to the same tier as them. In the past Discover always seemed like it was a good card but still a notch or two below companies like Visa, America Express, and MasterCard. I think this is evident in their cashback rewards and new customer offerings (cashback 2-5%, no interest first year, more competitive rates). These rewards certainly come at a cost but they help build loyalty and attract customers. Discover is also nearly always at or near the top of consumer ratings and customer satisfaction.\n\nI also think Discover has been trying harder to break into markets outside the US. For this company, there is still a ton of potential and growth for it internationally. Have they even fully tapped the US market yet? The ultimate question is whether they can give consumers enough of a reason to move over from other cards to them or at the very least add their card to their wallets. The company also seems focused on younger adults, which can be a double edged sword in that earning consumer favorability and trust early on can make life long customers but these types of people are also more likely to experience financial woes so bad that the company struggles to profit off of. I think as Visa shifts more focus on international goals, Discover will have more opportunities to prove their worth in the US market.\n\nDiscover is also trying to greater diversify itself as well. It\u2019s further pushing its banking options with competitive interest rates for savings accounts and loans. This again adds risk but also potential for higher rewards, especially with rates continuing to rise. When you look at Discover and Visa, you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re actually pretty different with one being more like a banking institution and traditional credit card company while the other is basically a payment processor platform and card maker. While they\u2019re both in finance and fintech sectors, owning both gives further diversity.\n\nLooking at the stock, Discover also seems to offer some value when compared to other credit card companies. Visa trades far higher than Discover does in terms of price/earnings. The company also pay a respectable and growing dividend around 2% which is nearly 3 times what Visa offers. Visa is still a great addition to any portfolio but Discover seems like a better value play as well and more of a hidden gem type stock when compared to other credit and banking companies. Discover also looks to have more flexibility in terms of cash flow when compared to Visa. I still think it\u2019s not a bad idea to buy visa, especially during any dips, but I think you\u2019re going to be paying more of a premium with Visa as the more \u201cexpensive\u201d stock.\n\nI think you can\u2019t go wrong with either company but Discover currently has the better value and is more of a higher risk/reward play compared to Visa. All that said, I\u2019d still take (and already have) Visa over Discover. Visa is just a great company that isn\u2019t your typical credit card company and already a leader in the cashless payment platform. But if you want to invest in a solid company and add a little more diversity within your finance sector of your portfolio, adding Discover isn\u2019t a bad move.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 0.6666666666666666, "submission_title": "Thoughts on American Express ($AXP) and Discover ($DFS)", "submission_text": "There is a lot of excitement around the electronic payment industry with much of the talk is centered around $MA, $PYPL and $V.
