I've done my homework as well.\n\nThe thesis is very simple...pure arithmetic.  Prior to Fukushima there were close to 900 listed companies claiming to have something to do with uranium. With the price so high everyone with a drilling rig became a uranium explorer. Like all commodities, uranium went through yet another boom bust cycle aided by the Fukushima incident. Today there are less than 40 listed companies in the uranium space.\n\nThe cure for low prices is low prices\n\nAs Cameco recently demonstrated the price of uranium is UNSUSTAINABLY low. It is not profitable to mine the stuff under $50 and no new production will ever come online until a sustained price closer to $70 is reached. This means, in simple math, the supply is and will be less than the demand thus forcing the price of the commodity back to a sustainable level.  It really is that simple\n\nWould you have turned your nose up when oil was in the teens a few years ago?  Was oil going out of style? Of course not. The time to buy oil was after the 08 financial crisis when no one wanted it and everyone was screaming that it would never recover...it's $80 now for Brent.\n\nThe same logic applies to uranium now.\n\nAs the topic post points out the demand is surging and the supply is diminishing...that can only mean one thing...higher prices. It's not an \"if\" question only a \"when\"  question\n\nEnter UUUU. UUUU has a very specific catalyst on the near term horizon...section 232 and a mandated quota requiring US utilities (100 of them) to buy 25% of their fuel from domestic sources. UUUU is the best capitalized, most liquid, largest producer with the ability to ramp up production quickly of the very few remaining US miners. The fact that there really are only 3 or 4 names to invest in is a huge bonus as is UUUUs ability to tap other markets like Vanadium which is at an all time high near $20. There simply is not other play with the leverage, skill, resources and advantages to take the lead in the new uranium bull market that MUST see the price recover to at least double the current spot price\n\nIf you study up on the two previous bull markets...2006 and 2011 you'll see that nothing but bitcoin can rival uranium. The market has a captive audience that cannot resort to alternatives. Nuclear is the ONLY carbon free base load provider of electricity and it's place in the world energy mix is very very secure.\n\nI'm certainly talking my book here but it's because I've done the homework. We are at the very beginning of a supply demand crunch that will see uranium the top performing commodity over the next several years. It's simple arithmetic not rocket science.

From what I've gathered in my education as a Nuclear physicist (doing fundamental research though, but that is in the same broad field), there is in general a lot of progress being made on the safety of nuclear power plants. I believe nuclear power is our best bet in the next 10-20 years for fighting to reduce the effects on climate change. The biggest problem it has is the public image because it is not well understood and safety due to Fukushima and Chernobil. Those accidents happened for a reason, but that is simply a part of growing experience we needed to go through to get the technology to the level that it is today. I believe if there are indeed many new power plants being built with the latest standards of safety(fukushima was ancient and should have been shut down before the accident but Japan and administration), then even the public might realize that the energy is safe to use. At least until we get renewable sources on the same cost/cheaper than fossil fuels, which might also happen in the next 10 years but we still need a transition period, we could use nuclear energy perfectly to fill that gap. If fusion energy production is ever achieved, it will not be in the next 10-20 years.

I've done my homework as well.\n\nThe thesis is very simple...pure arithmetic.  Prior to Fukushima there were close to 900 listed companies claiming to have something to do with uranium. With the price so high everyone with a drilling rig became a uranium explorer. Like all commodities, uranium went through yet another boom bust cycle aided by the Fukushima incident. Today there are less than 40 listed companies in the uranium space.\n\nThe cure for low prices is low prices\n\nAs Cameco recently demonstrated the price of uranium is UNSUSTAINABLY low. It is not profitable to mine the stuff under $50 and no new production will ever come online until a sustained price closer to $70 is reached. This means, in simple math, the supply is and will be less than the demand thus forcing the price of the commodity back to a sustainable level.  It really is that simple\n\nWould you have turned your nose up when oil was in the teens a few years ago?  Was oil going out of style? Of course not. The time to buy oil was after the 08 financial crisis when no one wanted it and everyone was screaming that it would never recover...it's $80 now for Brent.\n\nThe same logic applies to uranium now.\n\nAs the topic post points out the demand is surging and the supply is diminishing...that can only mean one thing...higher prices. It's not an \"if\" question only a \"when\"  question\n\nEnter UUUU. UUUU has a very specific catalyst on the near term horizon...section 232 and a mandated quota requiring US utilities (100 of them) to buy 25% of their fuel from domestic sources. UUUU is the best capitalized, most liquid, largest producer with the ability to ramp up production quickly of the very few remaining US miners. The fact that there really are only 3 or 4 names to invest in is a huge bonus as is UUUUs ability to tap other markets like Vanadium which is at an all time high near $20. There simply is not other play with the leverage, skill, resources and advantages to take the lead in the new uranium bull market that MUST see the price recover to at least double the current spot price\n\nIf you study up on the two previous bull markets...2006 and 2011 you'll see that nothing but bitcoin can rival uranium. The market has a captive audience that cannot resort to alternatives. Nuclear is the ONLY carbon free base load provider of electricity and it's place in the world energy mix is very very secure.\n\nI'm certainly talking my book here but it's because I've done the homework.

People are not going to avoid using the internet until faster cable is implemented, and having a monopoly on DSL would make the company very valuable, until newer technology displaced it. \n\nOP links to several sources which indicate fuel is in demand, while supply is shrinking. The spot price of uranium is very low right now, and it's evident that it will continue to rise. It would be prudent for all of these new reactors and government agencies to purchase at lower prices, instead of waiting months or years to buy at inflated prices.

", "parent_text": ">level 1zenicoin3 points \u00b7 10 hours agoI think looking at nuclear energy is a very interesting idea and I would argue there could be a long-term positive perspective.  From what I've gathered in my education as a Nuclear physicist (doing fundamental research though, but that is in the same broad field), there is in general a lot of progress being made on the safety of nuclear power plants. I believe nuclear power is our best bet in the next 10-20 years for fighting to reduce the effects on climate change. The biggest problem it has is the public image because it is not well understood and safety due to Fukushima and Chernobil. Those accidents happened for a reason, but that is simply a part of growing experience we needed to go through to get the technology to the level that it is today. I believe if there are indeed many new power plants being built with the latest standards of safety(fukushima was ancient and should have been shut down before the accident but Japan and administration), then even the public might realize that the energy is safe to use. At least until we get renewable sources on the same cost/cheaper than fossil fuels, which might also happen in the next 10 years but we still need a transition period, we could use nuclear energy perfectly to fill that gap. If fusion energy production is ever achieved, it will not be in the next 10-20 years. So I would actually argue that our best bet as humanity to fight climate change the most effectively in the next 10-20 years are in fact nuclear fission reactors.\n\nfusion energy is far away?

And, at today\u2019s prices ($18.50/lb.), that\u2019s almost $80 million of revenue.  Now, we have never done this type of production before, and we have not publicly announced our costs.  But, we are very optimistic about this generating good cash flow for us.  We also process alternate feed materials \u2013 either for a fee or for recovered uranium.  This line of business brings in nice revenue as well (over $7 million expected in 2018, I believe).  Finally, we have uranium inventories and continuing uranium production we expect to produce about 460,000 \u2013 520,000 lbs. of U3O8 this year.  So, we could always sell uranium to raise cash.

The petition also requests \"implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the President's Buy American Policy.\"\n\nIf passed, Energy Fuels stands to be the largest benefactor, as they are the best uranium mining organization in the United States. \n\nIn addition, Energy Fuels has [resumed Vanadium production](http://www.energyfuels.com/news-pr/energy-fuels-to-resume-vanadium-production-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-2018/), and \"expects to recover significant quantities of currently dissolved vanadium (as V2O5) from pond solutions at the Company\u2019s White Mesa Mill\". \n\n> Vanadium prices have risen by more than 400% over the past 24 months to about US $15 per pound V2O5.\n\nI can continue to share my findings, but I don't want a really big wall of text. I'd like to hear comments and criticisms from people smarter than myself, which is most people. \n\nTLDR: The uranium market is poised for large gains over the next 1-5 years. Energy Fuels (UUUU) is considered a top buy. ", "parent_text": "Brilliant!

You may need to push the time period back some years, but it\u2019s never not something you can do.\nThe issue with AMZN is specifically ignoring discounting, assuming that because within 50 years they may catch up, that means they\u2019re worth that now.\n\nAgain returning to the Apple example. Apple has some $70B in cash flow before dividends, share buy backs, and debt repayment in the past three quarters.\nAmazon had $-8B.\nIncluding debt pay back (not sure, I think $7-$9B) dividends ($30B) and share buybacks ($40) Apple has goes flat. \nAmazon meanwhile borrows $9B, issues another 16M shares, and of course pays no dividends.\n\nIf you just look at the financials of a company around Amazon\u2019s MC whose valuation is at least decently reasonable, you\u2019ll immediately see how massive of a deficit Amazon is in.\n\nEspecially when you take into account Amazon\u2019s WACC. I think it\u2019s around 16%? So Amazon must return 16% to satisfy their share holders. \nTake their current market cap of 921B (diluted share count of 506M). In 5 years that means a market cap of $1.93T.\nLet\u2019s say they really crush it, and make $200M over that time, or quadrupling last quarters earnings. This of course ignores the currency exchange tailwind, or the drop off of hiring which helps earnings, but goes against the thesis of \u201cgrowth per profit\u201d.\nSo they\u2019ll have something around $300B in equity, will be making $40B, maybe $60B annually.Their intrinsic value to market cap deficit has expanded from about $850B, to $1.6T. The next year alone will expand their market cap to $2.2T, an increases of nearly $300B against their earnings of maybe 20% of that.\n\nWe can clearly see the futility of Amazon ever hoping to live up to their valuation, that this scenario surely cannot hold up. And that\u2019s only seeking 16% return for 5-6 years. To say nothing of this expectation of 20%+ (or 50%+) returns for Amazon shareholders.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t check out. They cannot and will not make up that deficit, unless they manage to 20-40X their earnings within 5-10 years, which requires 16% quarterly earnings growth for 20 quarters up to 10% quarterly earnings growth for 40 straight quarters. That\u2019s 10 years of 45% earnings growth or 5 years of 81% earnings growth.\nIt\u2019s just not going to happen.

See CD Projekt Red, their current rise was so easily predictable if you know the studio and the development of their last game. Nintendo is no different.\n\nPositive :\n\n- Nintendo always release killer games (Pokemon, Zelda but also Nintendogs, Wii Sport...). -> they will be sporadical big rises. Wait for them and you will never lose money.\n\n- 10B in cash for 40B company. Their IP is at least 10B more. So you will not lose everything ;-)\n\n- They target 20M shipment in the fiscal year and even maintained it during last ER despite slowing sales (+ they are always very conservative). Pokemon won't be enough for that. -> something likely to be announced before the holiday season : a price drop (unlikely) or a (Pokemon?) bundle. \n\n- they already have been higher up and declined without any fundamental change. If anything, the Switch success is just confirmed even more.

I will DM you some Excel spreadsheets, but let me use Granite as a basic example. They're like 1/100th the size of Cenovus with a much simpler model.\n\nFund flow or cash flow (fund flow is more fitting for oil co's but it means ~ the same thing) is basically the cash wells generate for the oil company. In the case of Granite Oil, they'll generate 25-30mm in fund flows annually even at these stupidly depressed oil prices and WCS discounts (Canadian oil sells for less than US oil because of bottlenecking in transport etc). \n\nThe thing is, oil wells decline and new ones meed to be drilled to keep production up. Granite is run by geologists that are very good at managing these declines, but production drops if you don't drill new wells (Granite also does some gas injection stuff to maintain pressure but we'd be getting lost in the weeds discussing this).\n\nGranite can invest about 10mm in CapEx per year to maintain their oil production. They know their particular resource well, and have played with pressures and spacing over the years. People complain that engineers instead of business dudes run Granite, but they drill great wells...\n\nSo we get to the point where Granite nets 25-30mm in cash, invests 10mm to maintain that production and is left with 15-20mm in 'free cash' (money once the smoke clears in investing in the business etc). \n\nIf oil runs, that fund flow grows, CapEx stays about the same and free cash flow explodes... oil stocks don't generally look cheap like this near the bottom of comodity cycles... \n\nI've talked to the CEO and asked why they don't sink all their cash into growing production and I got a fantastic response (this is about 20% of what they sent me):\n\n>We generate lots of FCF, so what to do with it?\u00a0 Dividend, and debt reduction make the most sense for now.\u00a0 Growth does not\u2026\u00a0 Why \u2013 because we need to get better oil prices.\u00a0 We are reviewing all options to blend our oil and sell into another pipeline.\u00a0 Its our biggest priority.\u00a0 Otherwise, we view it as nearly giving it away.\u00a0 We are all shareholders and do what makes most sense, for everyone and everything.\u00a0 The \u201cthing\u201d is the reservoir.\u00a0 This bakken reservoir does not like when you push it, so we are not going to do that...\n\nI love this. They're maintaining production and giving us a great dividend while we wait. Companies like Crescent Point pay garbage dividends and invest everything into growing production... that stock has done nothing since the oil crash. \n\nIn summary :\n-95mm market cap company with 25-30mm in fund flows\n-after maintaining production with garbage Canadian oil prices, they generate enough cash to pay us a double digit yielding dividend\n-provides nice upside if oil recovers as they can begin ramping production funded by FCF generation rather quickly...\n\nHope this helps.
