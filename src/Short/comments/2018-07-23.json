To put things in perspective, this [article](https://www.businessinsider.com/world-stock-market-capitalizations-2016-11) notes that in 2016, the US had the largest percentage of world market cap. In other words, of all the stocks in the world, 36.3% is in the US. The other 63.7% is divided among various other countries, with China in second place with 10.1%.\n\nIn the 1989, at the height of the Japanese bubble, [Japan's TSE (Tokyo Stock Exchange) accounted for nearly 60% of global stock market capitalization.](https://investopedia.com/terms/n/nikkei.asp) Imagine that. 60% of the world's stocks were in the TSE. Even today, with all the exchanges in [North America alone, that number would only be around 40%.](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-stock-exchanges-by-size/)\n\nNow to go back to the Nikkei: the Nikkei basically tracks stocks that are traded on the TSE, starting in the 1970s. It basically took part in the bubble that developed in 1980s, leading up to and then dealing with the consequences of the bubble bursting in 1990. In addition to inflated Japanese stock prices, the Japanese Yen was also inflated, so when the bubble burst, Nikkei had to deal with both a sudden drop in the actual valuation of the stock itself, as well as the steady decline of the currency.\n\nThe S&P 500 is similar to the Nikkei in that it tracks the top stocks traded in the US. Difference is that Nikkei tracks the top 225 stocks in Japan, and the S&P 500 tracks the top 500 stocks in the US. As a result, when Nikkei dropped, they felt more of an impact as opposed to the S&P 500 which is slightly more diverse.\n\nSpeaking of which, this is going on a bit of a tangent here, keep in mind that Japan as a whole, even in the 1980s, is heavily invested in the tech sector. A decline in the tech sector makes a huge impact on Japanese index as a whole, as opposed to the US where everything is invested everywhere. If the tech sector is a bust, we've got healthcare and real estate. If real estate is a bust, we've got coal and natural resources (gold, cobalt, nickel, etc). If all of those are a bust, we've still got other sectors that can cushion our economy as a whole, while Japan does not.\n\nNot sure if this explained anything, but feel free to point out if I missed anything or made a mistake.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 64, "submission_ratio": 0.015625, "submission_title": "ELI5: Why does the stock market always go up in the long run?", "submission_text": "I know this isn't really considered as a one hundred percent safe \"law of nature\" \u2013 one example is the Nikkei index which still hasn't reached its peak level from the beginning of the nineties again.

I can see you've done extensive research. I like what I see but let me stretch upon each:\n\n- As far as those features they add over ISRG, do they hold patents for them? What's keeping ISRG or a competitor from coming in and using similar technology to improve their competitiveness.\n\n- I see additional benefits from the flagship features you listed:\n\n1. Surgeries can happen within less time since the surgeon won't have to stop in order to readjust the sights. All he has to do is naturally move his eyes to readjust. This may or may not create additional problems for the surgeons (there would need to be an industry wide study that shows this feature being a top want).\n\n2. Haptic feedback is nice as long as those surgeons are comfortable using that equipment. Which is where the introduction into academic facilities will come into play with the younger surgeons. I'll use a personal example: I used to work at a small dental equipment manufacturer, and the funny part about the industry push towards digital oral cameras was being held back by the older dentists who would flat out refuse to switch due to infrastructure costs and changing their business models. The younger ones obviously saw the benefit and cost savings and would often switch.\n\nLooks like TRXC is playing the IBM game that was done back in the 60's when computers were just becoming widely used. Introduce the product at the academic level and business levels, and eventually you'll become the industry standard for the coming generations. Similar notions can be said about Microsoft.\n\nOne thing people forget about in this country when it comes to hospitals is that they are often for profit organizations. If any cost or cycle time is saved on their part they can: Save money on equipment maintenance, perform more operations, and ultimately make more money.\n\nSadly, I don't understand what the current manufacturing landscape in Italy looks like, but as long as the equipment costs aren't affected by any tariffs, it sounds like they have a good chance of growing. However, since they are a smaller competitor to a larger mainstay company with less sitting capital and revenue, I would be cautious because of the current state of trade in and out of the US.\n\nEDIT: Looking at ISRG; that is a company that has stacked consistent annual growth YoY and doubled their share price since last year. I would think their move would consist of waiting for the opportune chance to buy out TRXC and consolidate their market dominance.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 14, "submission_ratio": 0.14285714285714285, "submission_title": "Robotic surgery TRXC", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 2.0}, {"time": 1532384360.0, "submission_id": "91anjs", "comment_id": "e2wt37l", "body": "sorry but when a company can miss revenue projections by 90% one quarter because they didn't sell a single surgical robot yeah that's not a sound company to invest in\n\nnvm in Q1 2017 they went from selling one robot to 2 robots in Q1 2018. damn look at that 100% growth\n\ncolor me impressed i'm dumping my life savings in this stock", "score": -2, "num_replies": 3, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 14, "submission_ratio": -0.14285714285714285, "submission_title": "Robotic surgery TRXC", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "That\u2019s exactly what Yahoo said about google.

Without Visa, square wouldn't be as popular. Without people wanting to use credit cards, PayPal wouldn't be as popular. Think about it this way- if you are a vendor, if you want to setup a physical store front, like a coffee shop or small boutique, Square is the company you choose, because other companies have high setup fees and are a hassle to use.  Square makes a dongle and other physical hardware that you buy to process credit card payments in person. The setup I imagine is pretty easy, and the payments are processed instantly, so you get paid instantly. If you want to setup an online shop, you might choose PayPal. For example, I outsource some of my work to India, and I pay my vendor through PayPal. Or, I just bought a Patagonia item and paid using PayPal, because instead of having to manually enter all of my shipping info and credit card info, I can login through PayPal and have all of it saved and ready to go almost instantly. Mastercard and Visa are issued by your bank to help expedite payments. Mastercard and Visa do not loan out money, but they are simply a toll road that connects your bank account with vendors. That is one important point to remember. American Express is a lender, so there are greater credit risks.

Most of the time it isn\u2019t the best sign, especially for a company that has been around for awhile or that has hit a rough patch.\n\nThe opposite of this are share buy backs where companies buy their own shares back reducing the number outstanding shares available to the general public, thus normally increasing share price.

Anyways, so this comes from thinking back to a friend speaking about silver the other day and it got me thinking about how gold in our last recession rose to where its at now. This made me start questioning silver and its rise in 2011. History has shown that both times silver has risen in a Bull market during a recession,and from what I am understanding, we are currently in a Bull market now. I've been noticing SLV has slowly been making its way down close to where it was back in 2008. My question to all of you is if we were to go into a recession within the next year or 2, what do you expect to happen with SLV? Do y'all think we will continue to remain in a Bull market for the next year or 2? Like I said, this is all new to me. I wish i could find some good instruction on all of this. \nThanks for the help!!", "parent_text": "SLV from the past and present Hi guys,\n\nI've been lurking around here for some time and I am still very new with all this.
