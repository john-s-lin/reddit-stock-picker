Alibaba is at a critical turning point. Shanghai Exchange is down 25% this year due to China Tariffs. This will reverse.\n\nNintendo increased profitability by 88% in the past year. Theyre at a critical turning point with the Switch (pokemon, smash bros, mario party, mario odyssey, zelda, mario kart, doom, doom eternal, ff7, ff9, world of final fantasy, ff15 pocket edition, rocket league, eventually metroid 4, fire emblem, etc)\n\nI recommend 50% in VOO and 25% in Alibaba and Nintendo. Buy more as the stocks drop 10%. \n\nIf you want to diversify a little more, you could always pick up Facebook which is low or wait for a good spotify price.\n\nSnapchat stock is super low. Theyve gone down like 50% this year. I recommend putting like 5% on them for a possible double.\n\nWATT stock is also super low. They do wireless cableless phone charging. They have 100 regulatory approvals globally for their contact Radiofrequency chargers that eliminate heat for multiple electronic device charging...i\u2019m hoping this is what\u2019s holding back Apple\u2019s AirPower device and Airpod 2 wireless charging case from being released (waiting for 150-180 regulatory approvals maybe). Watt released rf charging hearing aids ($7billion annual hearing aid market) that dont require changing tiny batteries every week with arthritis or plugging in a tiny usb that you lose. Watt also is releasing a smart speaker with an unknown customer in a few weeks that has contact charging and 6inch wireless charging without contact. Watt charging wireless needs more regulatory approvals, but it can do about 1-2 watts at 5 feet, which is like 25% of what the cable does withhout the cable. Watt wireless can go up to 15 feet (30ft full circle) and charge at like 100mw, enough to keep your device topped up. Little antennaes could be places anywhere to reduce the distance and increase the power. It\u2019s safe according to Fcc in US. Unlike Qi, which heats up objects indiscriminately and has electronic object detection issues requiring exact placement, WATT\u2019s Rf contact charging allows for ease-of-placement on a matt anywhere and it\u2019ll charge. I think theyre a huge acquisition target for any company looking to improve charging technology since theyre valued at $290million. \n\nI recommend putting like 2.5% or 5% in WATT. This stock could potentially go up 400% if Apple ends up being the \u201ctier 1\u201d customer they signed the non disclosure agreement with to integrate their products in for phones, headphones, and watches for the first year. \nWatt has partnerships with Dialog, who makes pmics (power chips) for iphones; pegasus, and foxconn. Watt\u2019s prospectus also mentions \u201cApple Compliance Testing.\u201d\n\nWatt will be releasing wireless charging tvs or computer monitors mid 2019 to charge video game controllers or mouses or keyboard or remote controllers. This tech will likely also be implemented in some cars since for example Hyundai Kona and Honda Accord i think have Qi chargers that say please dont place metal on it and please place phones carefully. Obviously with recalls of certain qi chargers for burns, WATT will be raking money in in the next year.\n\n\nIf you want to diversify more, Micron or MU i recommend 20% now. They report earnings thursday and already doubled their net income to $10 billion compared to last year and theyre only 9 months into the year. The stock dropped 25% for no reason. Their market cap is $50b compared to apple\u2019s $1 trillion. Apple makes $50billion a year in net income. Why is apple\u2019s market cap 20x Microns despite Micron making 25% in net income what apple makes in a year?

Tech, US big companies, US mid companies, EU, Asia. You want a good spread so you are exposed to every market. \n\nOnce you got 100% invested in index funds up you could start looking at if there's any stocks you are interested in. I would try to have less than 10-20% of capital as stocks. It takes a long time to understand how to trade stocks and build up the mentality. So just find 3 or so companies and buy some shares. Then you can check how they are doing overtime. Selling and buying new index funds is so easy so you can always just flip around your money between index funds/stocks.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.** And it's okay to pay someone to do it for you.  With investing, a good financial advisor also manages your finances for your specific situation.  It's not just about returns.  And it makes no sense to talk about returns without also talking about risk and goals (esp time horizon).  \n\nFor example, many people worship index funds (and they are a great option for many people) but they would not be suitable for someone retired with zero risk tolerance and enough savings to meet his/her needs with safe bonds.  Paying someone to help you figure that out and manage it is well worth it if it helps you avoid your worst case financial outcomes - which may be more psychological (avoiding a market crash or loss in principle).\n\nAre there bad advisors and brokers?

Happy Saturday to all.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of September 17th - 21st, 2018.\n\n# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks could buck September trend and hit new highs** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*\n\n* Stocks may aim for new highs, as soon as the coming week, even though there are some mixed cross currents impacting the market.\n* September is usually a weak time for stocks, but the market has defied a lot of market lore this year, such as August is bad for stocks and the \"sell in May\" trend.\n\n*****\n\n> Stocks could be bucking for new highs, even as the market deals with negative cross currents in what historically has been a weak month.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 closed out a positive week Friday with a gain of 1.2 percent to 2,904 and is now 12 points away from its all-time high. But traders are perplexed by the lagging performance of financial stocks, even as interest rates and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 3 percent Friday. Nasdaq was also higher for the week, with a gain of 1.4 percent, as tech shook off some of the worries that had been weighing on the group and rose 1.8 percent for the week.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of concerning that rates are back to 3 percent, and the banks are not acting well,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \"It may be they don't believe rates are going to stay up here. The banks muted expectations at a conference this week. A bunch of them spoke, and Wall Street didn't like what it heard about the next quarter.\"\n*****\n> The S&P financial sector was down 0.4 percent for the week and was the only negative major sector, even as the S&P edged within 12 points of its all-time high.\n*****\n> \"The question is can we get above and stay above the high of the year, which was 2,916. If we survive September and get through October, that could clear the road for 3,000,\" on the S&P 500, said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.\n*****\n> \"A close above 2,916 would open the door for more upside. It could happen next week. Next week historically is not a good week in the market. If we get past that, the probabilities increase for a fourth-quarter rally. That could start sooner than many people think,\" said Redler.\n*****\n> The coming week does not have much on the agenda, so traders will be watching for developments on trade with both China and Canada.\n*****\n> There are some economic reports, including existing home sales Thursday and the Philadelphia Fed survey, but not much in the way of major news on the economy. Fed speakers are also quiet ahead of their Sept. 25 and 26 meeting, where they are expected to raise interest rates.\n*****\n> There is also a late-quarter lull in earnings reports, with just a handful of reports, including FedEx and Oracle Monday, General Mills Tuesday and Micron Thursday.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OFfTiLA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wODnPlv.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/il87Gm8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/y063Gmq.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yfr82nt.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8xQHmg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PvFKZGY.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DNlL3vl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6GyOKJr.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cmWKtGc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/75KMvbJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hurricane Impact on Stocks\n\n> On behalf of the LPL Research team, our thoughts go out to the millions of people who will be impacted by Hurricane Florence.\n\n> We\u2019ve had many requests this week to look at how equities do around major hurricanes and, using data from the National Hurricane Center, we found that markets generally appear to have taken the catastrophes in stride.\n\n> \u201cAs tragic as major hurricanes can be, they appear to have little immediate impact on equity prices,\u201d according to Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, after the 15 most costly hurricanes to hit the United States, the S&P 500 has been higher six months later 13 times. Additionally, the returns going out one to six months are quite strong as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JziP6F6.png))**\n\n> If you are in the path of Florence, stay safe!\n\n*****\n\n# Any Fourth Quarter Rally Could Be Underwhelming\n\n> As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 5.1% year-to-date, S&P 500 is up 8.0% and NASDAQ is up a solid 15.5%. All three indexes are just a few percentage points below their respective all-time highs. S&P 500 and NASDAQ were at their highs in August while DJIA still has not cleared its January high. Nonetheless, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all well above historical average levels for this time of the year compared to past midterm years. S&P 500 and NASDAQ are also well above respective averages in all years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f1f40e4e14b75cfa81dcdf688adb1ce/tumblr_inline_pewtuvHdE81spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2e6adc657889bfa9e9c82092d6975ac8/tumblr_inline_pewtvfZdU91spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/3f7239de2079f1aa5b25a005872d0370/tumblr_inline_pewtvqRTqT1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> Comparing \u201cAll Years\u201d (solid red line) to \u201cAll Midterm\u201d years (solid black line) in the charts above there is a well pronounced fourth quarter rally in both whether the index was positive for the year or not. The rally is present in \u201cMidterm\u201d years beginning right around the start of October and begins slightly later in October in \u201cAll\u201d years. However, the magnitude of past fourth quarter rallies in \u201cMidterm\u201d years is notably greater across all three indexes than in \u201cAll\u201d years.

Happy Saturday to all.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of September 17th - 21st, 2018.\n\n# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks could buck September trend and hit new highs** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*\n\n* Stocks may aim for new highs, as soon as the coming week, even though there are some mixed cross currents impacting the market.\n* September is usually a weak time for stocks, but the market has defied a lot of market lore this year, such as August is bad for stocks and the \"sell in May\" trend.\n\n*****\n\n> Stocks could be bucking for new highs, even as the market deals with negative cross currents in what historically has been a weak month.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 closed out a positive week Friday with a gain of 1.2 percent to 2,904 and is now 12 points away from its all-time high. But traders are perplexed by the lagging performance of financial stocks, even as interest rates and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 3 percent Friday. Nasdaq was also higher for the week, with a gain of 1.4 percent, as tech shook off some of the worries that had been weighing on the group and rose 1.8 percent for the week.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of concerning that rates are back to 3 percent, and the banks are not acting well,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \"It may be they don't believe rates are going to stay up here. The banks muted expectations at a conference this week. A bunch of them spoke, and Wall Street didn't like what it heard about the next quarter.\"\n*****\n> The S&P financial sector was down 0.4 percent for the week and was the only negative major sector, even as the S&P edged within 12 points of its all-time high.\n*****\n> \"The question is can we get above and stay above the high of the year, which was 2,916. If we survive September and get through October, that could clear the road for 3,000,\" on the S&P 500, said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.\n*****\n> \"A close above 2,916 would open the door for more upside. It could happen next week. Next week historically is not a good week in the market. If we get past that, the probabilities increase for a fourth-quarter rally. That could start sooner than many people think,\" said Redler.\n*****\n> The coming week does not have much on the agenda, so traders will be watching for developments on trade with both China and Canada.\n*****\n> There are some economic reports, including existing home sales Thursday and the Philadelphia Fed survey, but not much in the way of major news on the economy. Fed speakers are also quiet ahead of their Sept. 25 and 26 meeting, where they are expected to raise interest rates.\n*****\n> There is also a late-quarter lull in earnings reports, with just a handful of reports, including FedEx and Oracle Monday, General Mills Tuesday and Micron Thursday.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OFfTiLA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wODnPlv.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/il87Gm8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/y063Gmq.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yfr82nt.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8xQHmg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PvFKZGY.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DNlL3vl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6GyOKJr.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cmWKtGc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/75KMvbJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hurricane Impact on Stocks\n\n> On behalf of the LPL Research team, our thoughts go out to the millions of people who will be impacted by Hurricane Florence.\n\n> We\u2019ve had many requests this week to look at how equities do around major hurricanes and, using data from the National Hurricane Center, we found that markets generally appear to have taken the catastrophes in stride.\n\n> \u201cAs tragic as major hurricanes can be, they appear to have little immediate impact on equity prices,\u201d according to Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, after the 15 most costly hurricanes to hit the United States, the S&P 500 has been higher six months later 13 times. Additionally, the returns going out one to six months are quite strong as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JziP6F6.png))**\n\n> If you are in the path of Florence, stay safe!\n\n*****\n\n# Any Fourth Quarter Rally Could Be Underwhelming\n\n> As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 5.1% year-to-date, S&P 500 is up 8.0% and NASDAQ is up a solid 15.5%. All three indexes are just a few percentage points below their respective all-time highs. S&P 500 and NASDAQ were at their highs in August while DJIA still has not cleared its January high. Nonetheless, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all well above historical average levels for this time of the year compared to past midterm years. S&P 500 and NASDAQ are also well above respective averages in all years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f1f40e4e14b75cfa81dcdf688adb1ce/tumblr_inline_pewtuvHdE81spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2e6adc657889bfa9e9c82092d6975ac8/tumblr_inline_pewtvfZdU91spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/3f7239de2079f1aa5b25a005872d0370/tumblr_inline_pewtvqRTqT1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> Comparing \u201cAll Years\u201d (solid red line) to \u201cAll Midterm\u201d years (solid black line) in the charts above there is a well pronounced fourth quarter rally in both whether the index was positive for the year or not. The rally is present in \u201cMidterm\u201d years beginning right around the start of October and begins slightly later in October in \u201cAll\u201d years. However, the magnitude of past fourth quarter rallies in \u201cMidterm\u201d years is notably greater across all three indexes than in \u201cAll\u201d years. This pattern would seem to suggest that this year\u2019s solid, above average midterm year gains could lead to a less than spectacular fourth quarter rally.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$MU** \n> * **$ORCL** \n> * **$FDX** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$RHT** \n> * **$GIS** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$DRI** \n> * **$APOG** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$UNFI** \n> * **$CPRT** \n> * **$MLHR** \n> * **$SCS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$AMRK**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/6GyOKJr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/n8zWGrn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.17.18 Before Market Open:***\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 9.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JdgRcsq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.18.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZVWsr5k.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.18.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WQLp14G.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.20.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QJULnuT.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SXJGi6k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.21.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $44.30 \n> **Micron Technology, Inc.

Happy Saturday to all.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of September 17th - 21st, 2018.\n\n# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks could buck September trend and hit new highs** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*\n\n* Stocks may aim for new highs, as soon as the coming week, even though there are some mixed cross currents impacting the market.\n* September is usually a weak time for stocks, but the market has defied a lot of market lore this year, such as August is bad for stocks and the \"sell in May\" trend.\n\n*****\n\n> Stocks could be bucking for new highs, even as the market deals with negative cross currents in what historically has been a weak month.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 closed out a positive week Friday with a gain of 1.2 percent to 2,904 and is now 12 points away from its all-time high. But traders are perplexed by the lagging performance of financial stocks, even as interest rates and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 3 percent Friday. Nasdaq was also higher for the week, with a gain of 1.4 percent, as tech shook off some of the worries that had been weighing on the group and rose 1.8 percent for the week.\n*****\n> \"It's kind of concerning that rates are back to 3 percent, and the banks are not acting well,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. \"It may be they don't believe rates are going to stay up here. The banks muted expectations at a conference this week. A bunch of them spoke, and Wall Street didn't like what it heard about the next quarter.\"\n*****\n> The S&P financial sector was down 0.4 percent for the week and was the only negative major sector, even as the S&P edged within 12 points of its all-time high.\n*****\n> \"The question is can we get above and stay above the high of the year, which was 2,916. If we survive September and get through October, that could clear the road for 3,000,\" on the S&P 500, said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com.\n*****\n> \"A close above 2,916 would open the door for more upside. It could happen next week. Next week historically is not a good week in the market. If we get past that, the probabilities increase for a fourth-quarter rally. That could start sooner than many people think,\" said Redler.\n*****\n> The coming week does not have much on the agenda, so traders will be watching for developments on trade with both China and Canada.\n*****\n> There are some economic reports, including existing home sales Thursday and the Philadelphia Fed survey, but not much in the way of major news on the economy. Fed speakers are also quiet ahead of their Sept. 25 and 26 meeting, where they are expected to raise interest rates.\n*****\n> There is also a late-quarter lull in earnings reports, with just a handful of reports, including FedEx and Oracle Monday, General Mills Tuesday and Micron Thursday.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/stocks-could-buck-september-trend-and-hit-new-highs.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OFfTiLA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wODnPlv.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/il87Gm8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/y063Gmq.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Yfr82nt.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/t8xQHmg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PvFKZGY.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DNlL3vl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6GyOKJr.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cmWKtGc.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/75KMvbJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Hurricane Impact on Stocks\n\n> On behalf of the LPL Research team, our thoughts go out to the millions of people who will be impacted by Hurricane Florence.\n\n> We\u2019ve had many requests this week to look at how equities do around major hurricanes and, using data from the National Hurricane Center, we found that markets generally appear to have taken the catastrophes in stride.\n\n> \u201cAs tragic as major hurricanes can be, they appear to have little immediate impact on equity prices,\u201d according to Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, after the 15 most costly hurricanes to hit the United States, the S&P 500 has been higher six months later 13 times. Additionally, the returns going out one to six months are quite strong as well.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JziP6F6.png))**\n\n> If you are in the path of Florence, stay safe!\n\n*****\n\n# Any Fourth Quarter Rally Could Be Underwhelming\n\n> As of today\u2019s close DJIA is up 5.1% year-to-date, S&P 500 is up 8.0% and NASDAQ is up a solid 15.5%. All three indexes are just a few percentage points below their respective all-time highs. S&P 500 and NASDAQ were at their highs in August while DJIA still has not cleared its January high. Nonetheless, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all well above historical average levels for this time of the year compared to past midterm years. S&P 500 and NASDAQ are also well above respective averages in all years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/1f1f40e4e14b75cfa81dcdf688adb1ce/tumblr_inline_pewtuvHdE81spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/2e6adc657889bfa9e9c82092d6975ac8/tumblr_inline_pewtvfZdU91spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/3f7239de2079f1aa5b25a005872d0370/tumblr_inline_pewtvqRTqT1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n> Comparing \u201cAll Years\u201d (solid red line) to \u201cAll Midterm\u201d years (solid black line) in the charts above there is a well pronounced fourth quarter rally in both whether the index was positive for the year or not. The rally is present in \u201cMidterm\u201d years beginning right around the start of October and begins slightly later in October in \u201cAll\u201d years. However, the magnitude of past fourth quarter rallies in \u201cMidterm\u201d years is notably greater across all three indexes than in \u201cAll\u201d years. This pattern would seem to suggest that this year\u2019s solid, above average midterm year gains could lead to a less than spectacular fourth quarter rally.\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$MU** \n> * **$ORCL** \n> * **$FDX** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$RHT** \n> * **$GIS** \n> * **$CBRL** \n> * **$DRI** \n> * **$APOG** \n> * **$THO** \n> * **$UNFI** \n> * **$CPRT** \n> * **$MLHR** \n> * **$SCS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$AMRK**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/6GyOKJr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/n8zWGrn.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.17.18 Before Market Open:***\nNONE.\n\n> # ***Monday 9.17.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JdgRcsq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.18.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZVWsr5k.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.18.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.19.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WQLp14G.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.20.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QJULnuT.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 9.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SXJGi6k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 9.21.18 After Market Close:***\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Micron Technology, Inc. $44.30 \n> **Micron Technology, Inc.
