The problem is that his success has made him feel superior.\n\nWhen we had the crisis with the kids of a football team in Thailand stuck in a flooded cave he went there to help and they wanted to make a mini submarine to save the kids. Was useless but he got a lot of PR. When he was called out on it not being helpful by an Australian dive instructor who were one of the main divers for the rescue Elon got mad and - in a now deleted tweet - states the Australian guy was a pedophile.\n\nElon dislikes short sellers a lot. When people short the Tesla stock it indicates they think it\u2019s overvalued and should go down. Elon doesn\u2019t like this. He had many tweets talking negatively about short sellers. His latest stunt about bringing Tesla private made a lot of short sellers lose many millions of dollars. It\u2019s now turning into possible stock manipulation and the company (and its shareholders) now risk getting a big fine due to Elon\u2019s stunt that some speculate was just done to hit short sellers.\n\nElon seems to have become too much of himself and seems to think he can say and do whatever he wants. He has a great vision and ambitions but this has started to be overshadowed by his personality and tendency to send out stupid tweets. If he focused less on obscure PR and stupid tweets and more on running his companies and drive the world forward I think he would be loved a lot more.

Unlike a lot of other telecom and utilities companies, they seem to actually show some signs of life when it comes to creativity and innovation which is always a plus for these massive, super mature companies. I doubt you\u2019ll see huge gains from a company like this but I think it can be a fairly stable and \u201csafe\u201d investment that pays a decent dividend and hopefully grow a little.\n\nFrom a numbers standpoint, it\u2019s PE is pretty reasonable, revenue is growing modestly, and their cell phone and internet sectors are doing solid. The dividend is nice if you\u2019re looking for a company that\u2019s in decent shape and able to rationally pay it out.\n\nNothing really unique or super interesting with a company like Verizon and they aren\u2019t going to reinvent the wheel here but if you want a stable, dividend paying company there are certainly much worse options. I personally brought AT&T as it had taken a fair beating as of late and pays a higher dividend that I hold in my IRA account. The debt scares me a little with them but I\u2019m hoping the TW deal will eventually pay off. However Verizon is still potentially a nice move and can see an argument being made as a better choice if you\u2019re seeking some dividend paying, relatively stable companies.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Verizon investment and thoughts as of 8/26/2018", "submission_text": "I have been interested in investing in Verizon for sometimes but always forgotten because there are much better choices.
