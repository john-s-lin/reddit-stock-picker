Don't put more than 10% into an option\n\nNo offence it's a bad advice.\n\n\\- I'm pretty experienced, but I know a lot of experienced traders who have been doing it for many years (including those who survived in 2008) and none of them puts more than 3% into an option, and that's a super high conviction trade, and usually on ETF, not a stock.For a stock it's 1%, 2% if they are sure. With 10% per trade it only takes 5 trades to go wrong for you to lose half of what you have, and you WILL have 5 trades going wrong. That's where the gambling aspect comes from - you can never ever be 100% sure what the stock will do. Some work a research may (and should) shift the scales from 50/50 to 60/40, and if you're lucky - into 70/30 territory, and that's your edge. But even with 70/30 odds putting 10% of your capital into one trade is very risky, not to mention 60/40.\n\n\\- Additionally, short term options play have absolutely nothing to do with DD. DD is for long term investing, with a minimum of a few years horizon. DD on FB hasn't changed since a week ago, yet it's down over 20%.

You want to predict the movement in your favor and that's how you can make money in the short term. \n\nLong-term options are good leverage but cost more. i.e. I think ABC stock will be at $price by next year because the company has good potential. If you're right the option will grow in value, much like a stock, over the duration you bought. \n\nObviously, it works exactly the same way when stocks go down. So you will lose more and the option could expire worthless if you're completely wrong. \n\nYou can also play the opposite, assuming a stock will be lower than a certain price in the future and make money off that. This is originally used to hedge your stocks. e.g. You have 1000 shares of ABC and you think it's going down in the next month, you buy 10x options to cover it just in case.

Those videos are just his daily thoughts on markets and certain stocks, so a lot of it isn't directly useful, but he always explains the *why*, not only the *what*, and I found a huge educational value in that. Note though that his stuff always assumes you already know basics of options trading, he wouldn't ever spend his time talking about what calls/puts do, and how to calculate margin, etc. Also note he is not a fundamentals guy, he's strictly TA person (and a TA person who doesn't care about MA, Stochastics, or any of those indicators). His basically two weapons are chart patterns, and public sentiment. This, combined with his experience trading for 20 years or so.\n\nHere's his channel: https://vimeo.com/user13139239\n\nFor example, check out this video he posted on Feb 9th (remember Feb 5th sell off)? He outlined a map, and few key turning point in the market for the next few months. He was off on the timing (his initial thought was it would take 3-4 months, and we're still going through it), but he was bang on with the turnaround points and the overall direction of the market since then.\n\nFirst time I came across his (about a year ago) I spent a lot of time looking at his videos, then I subscribed to his After Hours service (paid) and haven't regretted it.

BRK is a holding company; even big corporations like GE end up looking like holding companies when they have so many diverse units operating under them.

I rely on the \"rational market\" to ensure that majority stakeholders are holding the directors to their fiduciary obligations. Maybe this point comes into play *vis* Chinese corporations?\n\nFinally, you have the \"trust in the stability of a rules-based legal regime\". In this respect, I still don't see much of a concern.

You could make $30 working for half a day at minimum wage, depending which state you live in. It's much easier to work half a day for $30, rather than wait months or years for a 20% appreciation in share price and get the same amount of return. Just something to think about. I would advise actually consolidating your holdings and invest no less than $1500 a position, if you have the capital.

TD Ameritrade's Think or Swim is brilliant for that, they also have a lot of educational videos and info, they also offer free trades when you sign up (or they used to, anyway). When you're ready to trade, Robin Hood is great for that, they don't charge any fees for trading.\n\nIf you want to turn that $200 into $1,000 short term, then the low float stocks are the best bet for that, however the riskiest as well. I would definitely advise you to read a lot and educate yourself before you go into trading, or else you will lose that $200 in seconds.\n\nNot sure you've heard of Stocktwits, but that's a great platform where there's a lot of \"retail\" traders that you can learn from. You have to be careful who you follow and whose advice you take, but use your best judgement for that :).\n\nGood luck!", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 2.0, "submission_title": "First time to stocks", "submission_text": "I am kinda new to the stock market in of itself and this may seem dumb but I\u2019m looking for some intro stocks to get into.
