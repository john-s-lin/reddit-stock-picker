Wash sale regulations protect against an investor who holds an unrealized loss and wishes to make it claimable as a tax deduction within the current tax year.  The security is then repurchased in the hope that it will recover its previous value, which would only become taxable in some future tax year.  A wash sale can take place at any time during the year.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 14, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 115, "submission_ratio": 0.12173913043478261, "submission_title": "60k in Capital Gains YTD but 20k in the red on some positions.

Hi this is my first post on /rstocks and I just wanted some advice. When is the best time to sell a stock? I would preferably like to hold onto a stock for a while, but if a stock dibs and starts dropping i feel it would be better to sell it immediately and buy it again when it is low.  For example I got AMD at 10 and im on the high right now, but know where it has been for the past couple years I feel it will drop after a while.\n\nAre there any good signs for when it will drop alot or is it all a guessing game?", "parent_score": 29, "parent_ratio": 0.13793103448275862}, {"time": 1535041530.0, "submission_id": "99o674", "comment_id": "e4p8pq9", "body": "It's nearly impossible to know \"when\" to sell a stock. You'll likely never call the top (and likely never call the bottom for that matter).      \n\nYour best bet when investing is to have a sort of \"script\" set up before you even buy in. So, when you bought in at $10. You should have said \"ok, if this hits $x, I\"ll sell\" It helps take the emotion entirely out of it. Just follow your script.       \n\nWith AMD specifically, I'm in at $6, and originally said I'd sell at $15. After doing a lot more DD, I increased that to $20. I'm still holding. My opinion, they've just started to hit their stride. Their server CPU's are finally starting to take away market share from intel (last year, they had a 1% marketshare in ever growing, multibillion dollar datacenter market) That number will likely be at 10%+ by end of next year. Thats where the real money is with AMD. \n\nI told myself I'd wait til Q3 earnings to come out, and possibly sell half of my shares, and let the rest ride.

What do I mean by a correct mistake? Investing is a probability game. Let\u2019s say you go into a situation with 90% confidence that things will work out one way and a 10% chance they work out another way, and that 10% event happens. You sell it. Then there\u2019s a mistake that your analysis is completely wrong. You thought it was 99% one way but it was actually 99% the other way. When you realize that, sell as fast as you can. Hopefully at not too much of a loss, but even if it is a loss it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 you have to sell it.\n\nThe second time you want to sell is when the valuation swings way too much to the other end of the extreme. I don\u2019t sell a security because it\u2019s a little overvalued, but if it is way overboard on the other side into euphoria, then I will sell it. If you are right and hold a company for a long time, you have accumulated a large amount of unrealized gains. A big portion of those unrealized gains act like borrowings from the government interest free and legally. So when you sell that position, you take all the leverage and you take a bunch of the capital out, so your return on equity has just become a little less.\n\nThe third occasion when to sell is when you find something that is better. Essentially, a portfolio as I said is opportunity cost. Your job as a portfolio manager is to constantly improve on your basket. You start with a high bar. You want to increase the bar higher and higher. You do that by constantly improving the opportunity costs; you find something better. Those are the three reasons that I would sell.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 29, "submission_ratio": 0.034482758620689655, "submission_title": "Any advice on when to sell a stock?", "submission_text": "Hi this is my first post on /rstocks and I just wanted some advice.

It's white noise in between. You'll lose money buying and selling between those levels.

I usually give a stock 90 days after its IPO because that's when the lock-up period ends. But I am definitely keeping a watch on bloom.
