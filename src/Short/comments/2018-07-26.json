Personally, I think there is nothing wrong with owning only 5 stocks in your portfolio, but it takes a fair amount of experience, rationale, and discipline that you only truly develop after some time in the market. So if you're looking to get started right away, I would probably advise buying yourself some low-cost ETFs from Vanguard or Charles Schwab. Particularly S&P 500 ETFs. In the meantime, it will allow you to learn more about how the market works without making serious mistakes.\n\nFrom my own experience, when I first became interested in the stock market, I played the Investopedia Stock Simulator for about a year. What is great about this is that you are free to make all the successes and mistakes (there will be mistakes that you're glad to make on a simulator and not real life). It's an excellent learning tool to try your hand at picking the right investments, and I would highly recommend it before jumping right in and making some basic errors.
