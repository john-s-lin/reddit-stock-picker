Free markets don't just exist by themselves. Government needs to intervene, manage and regulate, and Democrats do indeed have a history of doing this e.g. Bill Clinton reduced public debt and presided over budget surpluses. Democrats have been market friendly in the past, but markets cannot simply be left to run by itself. The invisible hand needs the hand of government to guide it.\n\nRegardless of what a true Republican is, Donald Trump is the leader of the Republicans now, and as he said, he is a \"Tariff Man.\" Most Republicans seem to love the tariffs as well or at least most Replicans just go along with whatever Trump wants. What Trump and his supporters don't seem to understand is that tariff don't just hurt the Chinese. They hurt Americans as well because the tariffs paid by importers will be passed on to consumers, which will mean higher cost of living. Many American businesses need to import Chinese inputs for production of American products e.g. to make many American cars, you need to import e.g. a Chinese steering wheel. If the Chinese steering wheel is more expensive due to the tariffs, this means the company faces lower profits or it will cut jobs in order to maintain profitability. Furthermore, retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese will reduce demand for American exports, which will mean lower profits and/or job cuts.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 47, "submission_ratio": 0.0425531914893617, "submission_title": "Why The Odds Of A Rebound In The SP500 Are Increasing", "submission_text": "Hello again investors.
