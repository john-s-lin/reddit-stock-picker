This sector has yet to come to full fruition as we are awaiting for recreational sales to begin (most of MJX is weighted on Canadian cannabis stocks-http://portfolios.morningstar.com/fund/holdings?t=MJX&region=usa&culture=en-US).\n\nNow the current valuations for many of these companies is assuming everything will work out perfectly. And they will sell their product for a premium. But stock prices have rallied far too much too fast. While recreational sales are months away. Prices will need to revert back to reality. The reality that everything may not go as perfectly planned. Such as marijuana prices dropping as seen in the bloomberg article posted. Rallies can run into pure technical exhaustion. Where new buyers are difficult to find. Traders and investors in at far lower prices seeing gains of 200-500% will be quite tempted to take profit in fear of losing their gains if prices come off.\n\nBig market players tend to suck everyone into a rally. Just when it seems that this trend can not possibly stop they short the hell out of it and trap a lot of smaller traders. Stop them all out, only to buy back at lower prices. Rinse and repeat.\n\nIt is so easy to forget in this bull market that prices can come down just as fast as they have gone up.\n\nand my prior post:https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7ta1cj/mjx_looking_weak_here/", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 16, "submission_ratio": 0.0625, "submission_title": "How do you all feel about stocks related to marijuana companies?", "submission_text": "How do you all feel about stocks related to marijuana companies?

No secrete gold mine here, just a solid long term investment into the walmart of weed.\n\n* Aphria (APHQF) (APH.TO) - 3rd largest market cap, assets, cash, production. imo undervalued compared to WEED/Aurora. Already profitable. When the institutional investors come on board after July (aka canadian legalization) this stock will shine because they have the best looking financials.\n\n* Hydropothecary (HYYDF)(THCX.TO) - Mid Cap, Most likely to get a solid MOU from Quebec which will immediately boost it. Most likely to get listed in the two new ETFS coming out which will boost it. I plan to sell once the ETFS announce. (not a long term hold for me).\n\nThose are my favorite 3.
