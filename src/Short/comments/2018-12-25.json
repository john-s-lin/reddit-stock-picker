ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are a bundle of assets, much like a Mutual Fund or Index Fund. So, yes, there is an ownership of companies.

To do so, there is a lot of trading within the fund, again raising costs from fees (while, hopefully, lowering volatility). ETFs are similar to Index Funds, in that they are typically set up to mimic an index, sometimes inversely. They tend to be more static and are usually managed by an algorithm instead of a fund manager. This lowers costs from fees and overhead. As a result of their lower cost, built-in diversification (ideally, reliabilty to do what you expect), and the added benefit that they can be bought and sold through a broker just like stocks, ETFs are popular for \"short\" trades.

TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions:\n\n**Measure:** Is the security's price trending, has it dipped or is it a falling knife?  **Interpret:** Does the current price mean investors think it's undervalued or overvalued; when did they buy/sell more and why? **Predict:** If price reaches a certain point, will there be a rally or get rejected?\n\nThe main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as priced in):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.\n\nTA is best used for short term trading, but can also be used for long term.\n\nIntro to technical analysis by [Stockcharts chartschool](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#benefits_and_drawbacks_of_leading_indicators) and their [article on candlesticks](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_candlesticks)\n\n**Terminology**\n\n* **Indicator** - a calculation based on price and/or volume, it can be displayed as a line/number on a chart or watch list; some indicators use statistics like standard deviation such as the Bollinger Bands indicator\n* **trade signals** - when an indicator tells you that a buy or sell (short) entry is available (also called buy signal or sell signal)\n* **lagging indicator** - based on past prices, for example the Moving Average indicator\n* **leading indicator** - typically oscillators which fluctuate from 0 to 100 and back, and these typically measure the rate of change; they also generate overbought, oversold, and divergence, all of which help create trade signals\n* **oversold** - a trade signal for when to buy, for example RSI below 30, however it's best to wait when the RSI line points upwards past 30 before buying\n* **overbought** - the opposite of oversold; for RSI it's above 70\n* **divergence** - when an indicator and stock price move inversely which foreshadows a coming change in the price\n* **whipsaw** - when trade signals & price suddenly reverse either stopping you out or making you exit your trade\n* **resistance** - an area on a chart where [price can't seem to go higher](https://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/chart_analysis/trend_lines/trendlines-2amzn.png).  The main reason is that no one is willing to buy above that price or there's more sellers than buyers.\n* **support** - an area on a chart where price can't seem to go lower.  The main reason is no one is willing to sell below that price or there's more buyers than sellers.\n* **breakout/breakdown** - when price breaks support or resistance\n* **alerts** - a notification for when price hits your desired target, some software allows you to place the alert direction on a chart\n* **level ii** - This shows all bid & ask orders from market makers, usually your broker charges a fee for this, and is only really usual for day trading\n* **trend line** - can be a moving average, previous day's high, an indicator, you can even draw a line connecting all the highs or [lows for example](https://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/chart_analysis/trend_lines/trendlines-1emc.png)\n* [**Market participants**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/institutional-effect.asp) - also includes [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp), institutions, and retail & institutional investors.  Different markets have different participants such as futures (hedgers & speculators) and forex (banks & speculators).\n\n**Useful indicators**\n\n* **Moving average (MA)** - lagging indicator that averages previous prices, for example MA 20 will average the previous 20 days; MAs do not predict price movements, they smooth out price changes.  Common averages are 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200.  Typically you use 2 to 3 per chart.\n* **RSI** - relative strength index, takes the average gain of the stock price divided by the average loss over a number of periods, default 14; starts to reverse when it points down from 70 (sell signal) and reverses agian when it points up from 30 (buy signal)\n* **VWAP** - intraday indicator, takes the average price and weighs it by volume, basically you want to be short below VWAP and go long above VWAP; near the VWAP line (or price) there can be lots of whipsaw\n* **MACD** - combines momentum & trend indicators; gives off many trade signals including ovebought/sold and divergence, [see link here](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd) note that the histogram in the center shows how wide the MACD & Signal line are from each other\n* **ATR** - Average true range gives a number that tells you how wide price movements are, great for helping set stops.  ATR on a daily chart of 5 means average price movement of 5 points, typically you would have a stop loss 2x ATR so in this case it would be 10 point wide stop.  If a stop loss of 2x ATR is too high for you, then trade a different stock.\n* **Bollinger Bands (BB)** - takes the standard deviation of price times 2 (default); in statistics, 95% of all values are within 2 standard deviations.

ATR on a daily chart of 5 means average price movement of 5 points, typically you would have a stop loss 2x ATR so in this case it would be 10 point wide stop.  If a stop loss of 2x ATR is too high for you, then trade a different stock.\n* **Bollinger Bands (BB)** - takes the standard deviation of price times 2 (default); in statistics, 95% of all values are within 2 standard deviations.

So much of the world's economy is about data sharing and a majority are sick and tired of being a product and are moving toward services that either do not collect their data, are incapable of collecting data, or do not sell it.\n\n2. China is moving toward a consumption based economy from an export one. Their plan is to import 30 trillion in products over the next 15 years.....much of that will be from the USA.\n\n3. The Republican tax cuts have not delivered the cash into the general economy that was claimed. It has however done what was expected, put more money in private corporate hands and the hands of the wealthy. They are NOT responsible for any increases in wages whatsoever like is claimed. Those increases have come from a tightening labor market whos reasons vary but include an increase in deportations of illegal immigrants, a tightening down of employ-ability of illegal immigrants, and economic policies that make it more profitable to produce nationally rather than internationally which is soaking up more workers thus again tightening up the labor market. Wages are NOWHERE near what they should be and as we move closer to increasing the minimum wage to the absolutely bottom it should be profits for corporations will continue to fall as so will this overinflated, subsidized stock market that is only where it is because of wage depression spurred on by globalism, which is moving backward rather than forward and from a labor perspective that is a GOOD thing. Many nations are adopting \"sell it here, make it here\" or similar policies to ensure that their citizens have gainful employment and who can blame them?\n\n4. The youth of the world have felt FUCKED for the last 10-20 years and rightly so. An increasingly smaller number of people have been inheriting or consolidating an increasingly larger amount of the pie we all have to eat. They are starting to get into politics now and for better or worse, things are going to change. I'm here to tell you that its not going to be good for the market until these big corporations and businesses change their way of doing things. Plus many younger investors are looking at putting their money in companies that do considerably more than just make profit and that is going to change things as well. More money put into social programs and such is going to mean less money in return for investors. \n\nJust some thoughts. As for me, my trade of the year is going to be CASH and that is for the foreseeable future. This is not to say I won't dip into day trading when I see a good change to make a buck here or there but any mid to long term investments will be held off on until this ride downhill has reached the bottom.

You would expect that if a recession were imminent, the two-year yield would fall lower, reflecting expectations of Fed rate cuts to combat the downturn.\n\nAt this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.\n\nMost economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.\n\nIn this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts  |\n\n mentioned in the article as well. \n\nDown trend expected?

A good way to time your entry if your not sure where it's heading is dollar cost averaging. \n\n\nDCA method is where you buy more stock when the price is down and buying less stock when its high.  The key to making money is having a diversified well balanced portfolio of companies that you add new money too instead of trying to time the markets with.

My 401K in is a safe haven account paying 3% and is insured so I never will lose my principal. \n\nI felt that the long bull market would end soon so I invested for a few months and then took my profits and principal out. I have seen friends go into bankruptcy or close to it playing options. Just invest in a stock index fund or good mutual fund. You will find some of the best funds on Vanguard.com. They have a long and successful track record.\n\nAlso note that you cannot judge the marked short term. If you need money quickly and the market is down, you lose. Only invest money that you can keep in the market for 10 years or more. Over the long run and if you do not withdraw money when the stock market is down, you will make money. You just need to be able to let it ride out downturns and wait for it to go back up before withdrawing. \n\nMy real world example is a $1000 IRA rollover into the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund. It went up to $10,000 and then back to $1,000. When it went up to $13,000 I moved it into a CD. However I had 20 years time and could choose when I wanted to withdraw it. If you are saving for retirement start now. With the magic of compound interest you will do better in the market than not. Keep investing regularly so that you buy when stocks are high and low which is referred to as dollar averaging. So many experts run the numbers and doing it this way always does better than any other way,\n\nOne interesting thing you can verify on your own is that passive investing in stock index fund outperforms mutual funds and stock that are handled by financial advisors. They have ETF funds, Exchange-traded Funds, with low or no fees. They move up and down with stock indexes. I prefer mutual funds that balance my money between stocks and bonds. I am retired so I prefer the Vanguard VWINX mutual fund which is 60% bonds and 40% stock. You can find funds with all sorts of combinations. I do not own this mutual fund. It is just one of many that I am tracking for future purchases. \n\nThere are also Target funds that will run their course over whatever number of years the fund offers. As you approach your target date, like retirement it sill move your money more into bonds than stocks. It gets more conservative as it nears the target date.\n\nPutting all of your eggs into one to two baskets like buying stock in companies is very risky. Your money depends on the performance of the stocks you choose, However in a mutual fund your money is spread over many companies and bonds so  if one sector is affected the others can hold their own or even cover the loses from the bad sector. You are spreading your money over many companies from diverse industries. Many have stock in Apple, IBM, Google and other big name companies. So you get to own a piece of many companies with no one of them destroying you financially. \n\nTake a look at the VWINX mutual fund at Vanguard.com . You will find that even though it moves it is usually just a few bucks per share. It does not swing widely like other funds and stocks do. Of course your returns are not as high as some funds of which some made up to 40% profit, but are now down to levels from 5 years ago. It is all in the timing. Hope this helps a little. \n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 138, "submission_ratio": 0.007246376811594203, "submission_title": "Learning stocks", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Learning stocks [deleted]", "parent_score": 138, "parent_ratio": 0.007246376811594203}, {"time": 1545805640.0, "submission_id": "a9i66k", "comment_id": "ecklhuu", "body": "Buy puts", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 138, "submission_ratio": 0.007246376811594203, "submission_title": "Learning stocks", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Learning stocks [deleted]", "parent_score": 138, "parent_ratio": 0.007246376811594203}, {"time": 1545807148.0, "submission_id": "a9i66k", "comment_id": "eckmhh7", "body": "Okay get an account with thinkorswim paper money service.
