At least not immediately if you're planning on purchasing in the next few months. Mortgages are priced off of longer term USTs which the Fed can't directly control. When they raise rates, they do it on the short end of curve. On the other hand, they are trimming their balance sheet which consists of longer term debt, and if that selling pressure increases yields on the long end, *that* would raise mortgage rates almost in lock-step.\n\nNormally if the short end of the curve goes up, mortgages and other longer term loans will eventually go up because banks borrow in the short term and lend in the long term so the pass some of that cost along, but since it has to go through a process to make it to the end user it's not going to be as immediate a reaction as you'd see if 10 years went up.\n\nThe key factor to pay attention to is what the sentiment about inflation is. If the market thinks inflation is picking up, long term yields rise. The market sentiment about inflation is pretty substantially correlated with the reasoning the Fed gives for its rate hikes, so if they say that inflation is becoming an issue at the FOMC meeting, expect long term yields to move up and that *would* cause mortgages to go up.\n\n[Here's](https://themortgagereports.com/17724/how-mortgage-rates-move-when-the-federal-reserve-meets) a pretty decent explanation.

Would be very interested in what others think. Pretty much everyone else in here seems to he smarter than me:\n\nAcorns invests your money in ETFs, so pulling it out of there and putting it into different ETFs isn't necessarily a major change on its face. That said, it all depends on which ETFs you move into. Moving from \"Aggressive\" to SPYG is probably a mostly sideways move. You would lose exposure to real estate, foreign business, and small cap stocks mostly, and increase your exposure to large cap. Which is interesting to me since small cap businesses seem to have the most growth potential? (SPYG being a growth ETF).\n\nOne draw back of Acorns is that you can't invest in ETFs that might be of more specific interest, say BOTZ or ROBO. On the other hand, it seems to have done a good job of balancing where my investments go. 12% returns for no fees (still have a student email address) and 0 work on my part seems like a pretty good deal.\n\nPersonally, I think if we are talking about $1k, I think the fees and taxes might be the biggest concern. Robinhood at least will let you make the trades for free. They will not reinvest your dividends though, so your investment will not compound as well since you will have to wait untill you have enough Divi+cash to buy a whole additional share. Acorns will roll whatever Divi you get immediately back in. Also, depending on your particular situation, you may have to pay taxes on your gains when you sell what is in your acorns portfolio.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure it's worth it. A few percent difference would add up to a lot of money over 40+ years, but if you're looking to \"fire and forget\" Acorns seems to be a good way to grow your money until it gets big enough to be worth paying someone. I have a Robinhood side account where I invest in the weirder and riskier stuff with money I'm not afraid of losing. I beat acorns with that account through January, but the market correction got me good, whereas it was a small stumble for Acorns, which is back to pretty much the long term trend.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 9, "submission_ratio": 0.1111111111111111, "submission_title": "Having a $4999 acorns account", "submission_text": "Just curious how many people do it.

I'm betting on a run up to ~7.50-8 by mid April once the 5.50 range is broken. Very possible it wont take that long. There will be significant pullbacks along the way as people take profits. See yesterdays 5% drop sandwiched between two 20% days.\n\n I don't think there are legs to get past 8 without additional positive news, either continuation decision from J&J, trial news, or a buyout. Not counting on anything past 8 short term. \n\nEnd game, my guess is a buyout from J&J in the $20-$30 range but who knows.

You value this year's stock price with next year's projected dividend and projected growth. This is called the Gordon Growth Model or Dividend Growth Model (AT&T). When valuing Twitter you're basically talking revenue growth. How does Twitter make money? How will Twitter increase revenue year over year to justify an increase in stock price, or vice versa. Are they entering new markets? New acquisitions? Then incorporate this projected revenue growth in a DCF (discounted cash flow) model. This will solve for a Net Present Value. Not a market value, but it's a good start. You can treat a year's retained earnings as a dividend and then use Gordon Growth to solve. If you can't justify price targets fundamentally then you're by definition not performing analysis. You're basically guessing. You don't have to include the math but you do have to explain it. For instance, \"...current rates of revenue growth could justify a near term target of $38, and a hold rating\". Or some such thing.\nIf you don't do the math cite what research you are quoting. \nDate the document so you don't have to mention it in your introductory sentences. It's redundant. If you mention the industry use a metric for comparison. Most love P/E. Earnings are pretty much the favorite of analysts for explaining short or near long term movements in stock price.

Basically, you'll be aiming to meet the international market, not beat it, but that's the safer bet.\n\nIn my opinion you wouldn't wan't something focusing on small cap or mid cap--that's too risky for being in retirement.

The only way I know of to biff this up is if transaction #1 (wash sale loss) occurs in a taxable account, and transaction #2 (triggering the wash sale) occurs in a tax-advantaged account. \n\nFor your question:\nTransaction #1: Buy at $10, sell at $8. Net loss: $2/share. \n\nTransaction #2: Buy at $7. Wash sale loss adjustment will allow the disallowed loss to be added to the cost basis of this purchase. The adjusted buy price is $9/share, for tax purposes. Sell at $9.  For tax purposes, net tax should be $0 because the net gain is $0. \n\nThis is from IRS publication 550 \u2014 which you can also look up on irs.gov.  Please see the section I bolded.\n\n\u201cA wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you:\n\n1. Buy substantially identical stock or securities,\n\n2. Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade,\n\n3. Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities, or\n\n4. Acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account (IRA) or Roth IRA.\n\nIf you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock, you also have a wash sale.\n\n***If your loss was disallowed because of the wash sale rules, add the disallowed loss to the cost of the new stock or securities (except in (4) above). ***\n\nThe result is your basis in the new stock or securities. This adjustment postpones the loss deduction until the disposition of the new stock or securities. Your holding period for the new stock or securities includes the holding period of the stock or securities sold.\n\nExample 1.\n\nYou buy 100 shares of X stock for $1,000. You sell these shares for $750 and within 30 days from the sale you buy 100 shares of the same stock for $800. Because you bought substantially identical stock, you cannot deduct your loss of $250 on the sale. However, you add the disallowed loss of $250 to the cost of the new stock, $800, to obtain your basis in the new stock, which is $1,050.\u201d\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 1.5, "submission_title": "wash sale rule question, Could end up loss but still pay tax?", "submission_text": "I am reading the wash sale rule since I found out it when I was doing tax.\nIf I understand correctly.
