Everyone gives tips about \"mental fortitude\", etc. It's nonsense. In a bull-market it's literally the easiest thing in the world to simply buy (at any price) and become profitable. Pick any asset in an uptrend during a bull market (for that asset class), walk away and win.\n\nIt is only during side-ways or bear markets that we truly find out what trading is all about. \n\nI trade for a living (to support my game-dev and travel hobbies), through ups and downs. I would not be successful if I took 10% hits for no particular reason. Taking a 10% hit is a sign of lack of strategy (unless your strategy assumes a 10% draw-down over a long-term). \n\nWhere people get into trouble is over-trading, trading time-frame, and risk management. \n\nYou don't have to endure a 10% correction, you merely have to size your position such that a 10% correction yields a more maneagable hit. You size your strategy to your personal risk level. For instance, I hate losing... I mean.. I HATE losing money. As a result, my strategy that I've been using for 10yrs now focus on small loses and mid/big sized hits. I risk around .2% per trade on average but I focus on keeping my trading mechanical and avoiding high volatility assets. \n\nI don't win big every week, but I also don't draw-down more than maybe 1-2%. Even so, I make more trading than I made as a software engineer in SV (though arguably trade longer hours than I used to work). \n\nThe point is, it's not about fortitude or toughness, that stuff is all great in a bull run but it's mental-stuffing-pat-yourself-on-the-back-nonsense. Great trading (for sustainability) is about figuring out a strategy that works for your personal level of risk tolerance. If you can stick to your system and make a solid return every week you'll survive through thick and thin. If you try to \"go big or go home\" or hold every losing position for large losses... eventually... you either won't recover, or will be losing sleep as you mount 20, 30% losses.

Can NASDAQ drop 50%+?  Yes, see 2001, 2008\n\nI should clarify the above is not likely but if an asset drips down -50%, a leveraged asset needs to gain much more on a percentage basis to break even.

People go to school for this, spend their lives learning about this, and still no one has figured out how to time the market. It's exactly like gambling; sometimes you win, but more often you lose.

A stock can have the best fundamentals in the world but one slightly negative news report about a mildly related industry will send it crashing for no reason. Or a company can have no discernable business plan and exist totally on debt and speculation but go through the roof. Long term it all tends to work out, good companies give you good returns, but there is absolutely no telling what a stock will do from day to day. You'll feel like a genius during bull markets because everything is going up, then lose it all overnight when investor sentiment changes.  Since it isn't rational there's no rational way to predict it. \n\nSeriously. Consider the fact that there are tens of thousands of people who have studied this for years and made it their full time job.

It's very possible that your company's stock will decline in value.  \n\nMy advice is to cash out the stocks, keep enough cash for an emergency fund (a few months of expenses), put the rest towards debt, continue chunking away at the debt, and start investing for retirement after you're debt free.\n\nGood luck!  \n\nEdit: Overall, you are in very good shape because of your high income, and you can get out of debt quickly.

However, you're playing an interest rate game that really won't make a big difference in the long run.  This game also ignores the risk.  It's very possible that your company's stock will decline in value.  \n\nMy advice is to cash out the stocks, keep enough cash for an emergency fund (a few months of expenses), put the rest towards debt, continue chunking away at the debt, and start investing for retirement after you're debt free.\n\nGood luck!  \n\nEdit: Overall, you are in very good shape because of your high income, and you can get out of debt quickly.

IMO, this has improved as they've slowly moved customers to their cloud solutions from various legacy systems.

For example, integrating specialized systems is getting easier and easier. Why pay the hefty price tag for Sf, Dynamics or Oracle when you can use Zapier to integrate Oodo with other systems for a quarter the costs and still meet your business needs? I've done countless Sf installs, and the vast majority would've been better off combining other systems better suited for the specific tasks.      \n       \n> What sort of competition is Oracle going to pose?     \n     \nWell, they basically are the only competition, which is why I think this whole market so ripe for disruption. All of them have been garbage for decades and so many customers are seeking alternatives. Imo, AMZN or GOOG are eventually going to step in and wreck Salesforce and Oracle's ERP business. Microsoft may escape unscathed because they're products integrate better with Office and LinkedIn, but Sf and Oracle are sad islands that have been intentionally making integrations harder without having a software base like Office to fall back on.      \n     \nStill, all that said, ***you could certainly make money on CRM until someone shits on their parade***, which may be a while. It's also possible CRM prevents parade shitting with their rather absurd rate of patenting tech. Lastly, I will give kudos to Sf for being king of the nickel-and-dime.

IIRC, there's another Idea for bill-to, but I'm drunk and on mobile (Googling and links are hard rn). Anyway, I can't say why they make those sorts of decisions. IME, they typically have good technical reasons but don't bother explaining everything to customers (cause most wouldn't understand nor care). Also, they do have [a couple common solutions](https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000hAHUAA2), which are basically 1) link the Accounts using a Parent Account lookup, or 2) build a new Object for addresses and pull it's records into the Account's Related List. Those options work well enoughfor most companies that an AppExchange app seems unnecessary, but that's never stopped app devs from building an app anyway (nor does it stop bad Sf Admins from buying them, lol). So, there could be a few, and I'd not be surprised. The second method (Junction Object) is also their common workaround for many-to-many relationships, but it causes all sorts of issues such as Search, Reporting, assigning Contacts per location, etc. ...again, all problems have workarounds. It's all just a matter of dev time/cost/benefit analysis. ...but, since each workaround causes other limitations, it becomes a vicious cycle of more complex fixes on a less stable, larger house of cards -- all caused by a silly limit that people asked to have fixed years ago...     \n    \nHope that helps.

All that matters is what you buy at and what you sell at.  If you buy a stock for $1 and sell at $2, you doubled your money, regardless of market cap.  You can make a profit even if market cap goes down.\n\nYou'll probably pay a transaction fee buying and selling the stock- $5-10.  If you hold it for more than a year, you'll pay capital gains taxes of 0-15%, if you hold for less than a year you'll pay your regular tax rate.  So to just make a profit, you need the stock to rise high enough to cover the transaction fees on each end- when you buy and when you sell.  That's it.  You only pay tax if you make a profit.\n\nExample:  You buy 10 shares of XYZ for $10 each.  You have $100 of XYZ stock and you paid a $5 fee to buy it.  XYZ rises to $11 per share and you sell your 10 shares for $110.  You pay a $5 fee to sell.  So you bought in for $100, cashed out for $110, and paid $10 in fees- you broke even.  It really is that simple.\n\nBut stocks don't behave rationally and there's no tried and true way to predict if the price will go up or not in the short term.  If you don't know anything about stocks, you're best sticking your money in an index fund or ETF.  You want one with a low expense ratio- the expense ratio is how much money the managing company takes to run the fund.  Something like SWTSX tracks the entire stock market and the expense ratio is a tiny 0.03%.  You're diversified among all stocks and sectors so if one company or one sector takes a hit, you're fine.  And you don't have to know a damn thing about stocks to still get in on gains during bull markets.  You can also look for funds that track large cap, small cap, international, different sectors like tech, etc.  \n\nIf you're trying to invest in individual stocks, don't come in as a new investor trying to pick the next winner.  You won't.  People devote their lives to the stock market and still don't fare better than index funds in the long run.  You can throw some money into obvious choices like Google, Apple, Visa, Microsoft, Paypal, etc.  But unless you're willing to devote a lot of time to learning about stocks and tracking the market daily, you're really best off just sticking with an index fund and blue-chips.\n\nI like *The Boglehead's Guide to Investing* as a primer that will explain the basics to you in an easy-to-read way, and explain exactly why trying to time the market is stupid and investing in index funds is the smartest long-term bet.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "most accurate & helpful primer on stocks you would recommend? for example, if you buy a stock that is 1 billion market cap, how much would it need to increase for you to make a profit (after taxes)?", "submission_text": "most helpful primer on stocks you would recommend? \n\nfor example, if you buy a stock of a company that is 1 billion market cap, how much would the company's market cap need to increase for you to make a profit (after taxes)?", "parent_text": "most accurate & helpful primer on stocks you would recommend? for example, if you buy a stock that is 1 billion market cap, how much would it need to increase for you to make a profit (after taxes)? most helpful primer on stocks you would recommend? \n\nfor example, if you buy a stock of a company that is 1 billion market cap, how much would the company's market cap need to increase for you to make a profit (after taxes)?", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1517931928.0, "submission_id": "7vo62j", "comment_id": "dttqgmi", "body": "Sorry, your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7vo62j/pro_tip_if_you_are_not_mentally_and_emotionally/) in /r/stocks has been automatically removed as low effort.  **Please resubmit your post with some more text in the body.**\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/), or [Streetinsider](https://www.streetinsider.com/).  **Then come back here to post** your findings, thanks!\n\nA list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
