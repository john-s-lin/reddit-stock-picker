Google Play Music, Apple Music, and Amazon Music are all complete jokes compared to Spotify.\n\nSpotify UX is years ahead, from ease-of-use in UI, to individualized Machine-Learning produced weekly playlists, to ML-recommended songs and Spotify-currated playlists. Google Play music has an alright UX but their ML game is years behind SPOT imo -- there's a complete lack of weekly ML-recommended custom playlists; Apple Music has absolutely zero ML; Amazon Music looks like it's from 2004 and they laughably still use the pay-per-song model for some songs.\n\nSpotify is also the only platform to produce what could be considered original content -- they seem to have hired professionals to curate their \"by Spotify\" playlists, which their ML algorithm recommends to you based on listening. They've also tested \"Spotify Sessions\" albums with select artists in the past - showing that they may be interested in becoming a studio in the future. Contrast that with Google and Amazon who have no such feature, or Apple who only has a few platform-exclusive songs/albums.\n\nAdditionally, whenever new music comes out I can never depend on it to be on Amazon or Google. Spotify has become very good at artist/label outreach and making sure they're at least the 2nd platform everyone goes to when they drop something major. Often YouTube or SoundCloud, or perhaps even Apple Music/TIDAL are more reliable as first platforms but Spotify is always a very consistent second platform for them to drop on and more often than not, the first platform too. \n\nIn terms of catalogue Apple and Google are in first but Spotify isn't very far behind and will almost always have the most popular artists. Where Spotify makes up for this is in their ML recommendations -- you don't need an artist's entire catalogue if you can just continuously listen to music that sounds just like theirs and discover new artists simultaneously thanks to good ML to track your listening preferences. I can't comment on Amazon's library tbh.\n\nPricing is another story. Spotify has a plethora of plans to compete with the others but I think Google or Amazon has the edge here. Amazon's service is bundled with Prime which any serious Amazon shopper already has, Play Music is bundled with YouTube Red which is either $5/mo individually or $15 for a family of 6, Spotify is $8/mo normally, $5 for students with proof of student ID, or $15 for a family of 6, and Apple Music is $10 normally, $5 for students, and $15 for a family. So Amazon seems to have the advantage here because basically anyone using Amazon seriously already has prime.\n\nPersonally, I've tried using GPlay but it feels second class to Spotify, as do Apple and Amazon Music. Basically everyone I know who listens to music uses Spotify if they have a paid service for it. I'd be interested in userbase statistics. I'm very long on Spotify just because of the user experience compared to other platforms.

ETFs that cover something like the S&P 500 or some variation of a Total Stock Market Fund are a great start and backbone to any portfolio. These funds cover hundreds or even thousands of companies throughout various sectors. For probably 90% of the people out there, index funds will perform you better than picking and investing individually in companies yourself. Even professionals often struggle to beat index funds over time. It can be done but it takes a lot of work, knowledge, research, time, effort, and luck to beat them.\n\nIf you want to spice it up a little more, you can look into sector ETFs like ones focusing on technology, healthcare, energy, finance, consumer staples, etc. Some people like avoiding certain sectors or being heavier invested in some sectors than others which why they go with sector based investing or use such funds to complement their index funds. There are also ETFs that focus on small, mid, or large cap companies as well and others that focus on international markets and companies. Today, there is an ETF for basically anything including ones that cover the weed sector!\n\nIf you really want to invest in individual companies, don\u2019t try to find the next Amazon or Apple in its infancy. At least not early on in your investing days. Instead, look for growing yet established successful companies that have proven track records. Companies like Apple, Visa, JP Morgan, or Berkshire Hathaway (which operates almost like an ETF in itself). Avoid the \u201cmeme stocks\u201d or companies that live off of hype but bring little to the table such as SnapChat. Make sure the company brings something unique to the table, has a solid foundation, decent MOAT, good leadership, decent financials, solid potential, and a bright yet realistic future outlook. Look at the trends, competition, and environment the company finds itself within and deals with.\n\nSuccessful investing often involves the duller and less exciting companies. It\u2019s the companies that are often right under your nose and that you see and deal with every day. Don\u2019t be fooled by companies that come off as cool or have a leader who\u2019s good with words. Instead look at the company itself and consider what makes it a good company that will continue to succeed.\n\nMost importantly, be patient and don\u2019t panic sell. Your holdings will go up, down, and sideways. Don\u2019t panic sell when your down and take a loss, especially if you\u2019re holding index or sector funds. They have historically always recovered and then some over the long run.

ETFs that cover something like the S&P 500 or some variation of a Total Stock Market Fund are a great start and backbone to any portfolio. These funds cover hundreds or even thousands of companies throughout various sectors. For probably 90% of the people out there, index funds will perform you better than picking and investing individually in companies yourself. Even professionals often struggle to beat index funds over time. It can be done but it takes a lot of work, knowledge, research, time, effort, and luck to beat them.\n\nIf you want to spice it up a little more, you can look into sector ETFs like ones focusing on technology, healthcare, energy, finance, consumer staples, etc. Some people like avoiding certain sectors or being heavier invested in some sectors than others which why they go with sector based investing or use such funds to complement their index funds. There are also ETFs that focus on small, mid, or large cap companies as well and others that focus on international markets and companies. Today, there is an ETF for basically anything including ones that cover the weed sector!\n\nIf you really want to invest in individual companies, don\u2019t try to find the next Amazon or Apple in its infancy. At least not early on in your investing days. Instead, look for growing yet established successful companies that have proven track records. Companies like Apple, Visa, JP Morgan, or Berkshire Hathaway (which operates almost like an ETF in itself). Avoid the \u201cmeme stocks\u201d or companies that live off of hype but bring little to the table such as SnapChat. Make sure the company brings something unique to the table, has a solid foundation, decent MOAT, good leadership, decent financials, solid potential, and a bright yet realistic future outlook. Look at the trends, competition, and environment the company finds itself within and deals with.\n\nSuccessful investing often involves the duller and less exciting companies. It\u2019s the companies that are often right under your nose and that you see and deal with every day. Don\u2019t be fooled by companies that come off as cool or have a leader who\u2019s good with words. Instead look at the company itself and consider what makes it a good company that will continue to succeed.\n\nMost importantly, be patient and don\u2019t panic sell. Your holdings will go up, down, and sideways. Don\u2019t panic sell when your down and take a loss, especially if you\u2019re holding index or sector funds. They have historically always recovered and then some over the long run. If you do your research carefully and stay patient and rational, you\u2019ll make out decent in the long run.\n", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1526311954.0, "submission_id": "8j3xtd", "comment_id": "dyyp051", "body": "When I was 18, I moved into a house with some co workers in the woods.

The point being?  ...buybacks aren't everything and are easily subsumed by \"news\".  I don't know what the catalyst was for the January drop.\n\nThe other thing to glean from this section is that, typically, a company will set aside funds for repurchases, but the don't have to disclose what type of purchases will be executed or when they'll do it.  In the notes section, newell clearly says they suspended repurchases for an acquisition.
