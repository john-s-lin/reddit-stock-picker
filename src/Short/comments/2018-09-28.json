Throw in some $YINN as well if you think China will outperform. These are 3x leveraged ETFs, and despite what people say about leveraged daily rebalancing decay in reality it's a moot issue that evens out due to the bias towards bull periods. Over the long-run these should return pretty close to 3x the market. Like you said, it's only $500, so it's not a big deal if there's a stock market crash tomorrow and you lose it all -- _if_ that happens just throw another $500 in there and get it started again.  Also, make sure dividends get reinvested. Due to compounding and the long time horizon, it is likely to grow to over $50k (assuming an average 30% return per year, based on 3x SPY's average 10% a year). However, if you add an additional $500 to the account each year, it'll end up being worth around $300k after the 18 years if markets continue to perform on average like they have the past 100 years.", "score": 0, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 38, "submission_ratio": 0.0, "submission_title": "Want to buy my newborn $500 worth of a single stock with a huge upside to gift him in 18 years when he graduates high school.

The layers of speed of news reaction go from algos > institutions/professionals > retail investors. But retail investors like us have a spectrum too that flows from informed traders to ill informed traders.\n\nBeing ahead of the ill informed is a big leg as you will react way before they will. With things like keeping up with the market at both macro scale (knowing dates of specific events that will affect the market like jobs numbers, tariff implementation dates, etc) and micro (Analyst upgrades/downgrades, bad/good news release regarding a stock, watching your watch list PM/AH).\n\nExample of this for me has been tariffs at a macro scale. Following tweets of trump and shorting the market when the impact of his tweets \"sound\" massive & silly enough. Also knowing the monthly job numbers are coming or when there is a fed meeting. Anaylst upgrades are also another thing I watch out for: i.e. Square received a massive praise from an anaylst suggesting its should be included in FAANG**S.** Though it moved up pre market... the magnitude of the praise was too good to sit idle and think algos already bought all there is to buy... so I bought in at open and sold at close with a call otpion... It moved an additional 6% during this time and I walked out with a decent amount because of this. Same is true for when semi conductors get downgraded. Bought SMH puts for the month.\n\nI dont think the average investor is spending this much time as they prefer to just buy and forget. So you will have the advantage over them to swing what they just hold,sell before its too late and of course find opportunities you would otherwise never find.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\nNow to answer your question /u/ZeroTide\n\n\\- Bloomberg Radio (via iheartradio), this is my drive to/from work listen.

Again dont follow their stock advise section, make your own consensus on the companies themselves. But utilize these for staying up to date with the market.\n\n\\- Google the stock under news and sort it by latest. I do this if I see a stock down -6% but cant find out why.

The layers of speed of news reaction go from algos > institutions/professionals > retail investors. But retail investors like us have a spectrum too that flows from informed traders to ill informed traders.\n\nBeing ahead of the ill informed is a big leg as you will react way before they will. With things like keeping up with the market at both macro scale (knowing dates of specific events that will affect the market like jobs numbers, tariff implementation dates, etc) and micro (Analyst upgrades/downgrades, bad/good news release regarding a stock, watching your watch list PM/AH).\n\nExample of this for me has been tariffs at a macro scale. Following tweets of trump and shorting the market when the impact of his tweets \"sound\" massive & silly enough. Also knowing the monthly job numbers are coming or when there is a fed meeting. Anaylst upgrades are also another thing I watch out for: i.e. Square received a massive praise from an anaylst suggesting its should be included in FAANG**S.** Though it moved up pre market... the magnitude of the praise was too good to sit idle and think algos already bought all there is to buy... so I bought in at open and sold at close with a call otpion... It moved an additional 6% during this time and I walked out with a decent amount because of this. Same is true for when semi conductors get downgraded. Bought SMH puts for the month.\n\nI dont think the average investor is spending this much time as they prefer to just buy and forget. So you will have the advantage over them to swing what they just hold,sell before its too late and of course find opportunities you would otherwise never find.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\nNow to answer your question /u/ZeroTide\n\n\\- Bloomberg Radio (via iheartradio), this is my drive to/from work listen. BNN Bloomberg at 5pm though, only because they broadcast out bloomberg tech show with emilie chang. Which is by far my favourite way to stay on top of tech news and get stock recommendations.\n\n\\- Seeking Alpha contains my watchlist. I use it for alerts on my phone to get the latest update on whatever the stock is doing. Though I dont follow their advise section. Just market alerts, they come in like text messages through out the day.\n\n\\- [Bloomberg.com](https://Bloomberg.com), I find Bloomberg great for the macro economic news. So they keep me up to date at that scale.\n\n\\- Marketwatch, Seeking Alpha, The Street, CNBC, Motley Fool, Zacks are decent reads to do on your free time. Again dont follow their stock advise section, make your own consensus on the companies themselves. But utilize these for staying up to date with the market.\n\n\\- Google the stock under news and sort it by latest. I do this if I see a stock down -6% but cant find out why. Always get the answer this way.\n\n\\- Reddit: There is a nice flow of stock recommendations, reactions and discussions here and all the other stock subreddits as well.", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.2}, {"time": 1538129442.0, "submission_id": "9jll9i", "comment_id": "e6se251", "body": "No you not crazy very good step just invest part of money not all :) Best of luck !

Well you'd only have tax liability on 30k (instead of 40k). Again selling all of it would result in a tax on 30k which can be 0$ if you meet the IRS limits.

So it makes sense that if you have a very large gain, you sell the stock, and then immediately rebuy it to lock in a tax of 0$ which steps up your cost basis. \n\nExample:\nYou have a cost basis in stock A for 10,000$. It has a market value of 20k. You don't want to sell because you believe it will appreciate even more. So sell the stock and immediately repurchase it back. Your income will be 10,000$ and you will pay 0% if you held it long term. Then once you purchase it back, your new cost basis is 20,000$. \n\nAnother year passes and it is now worth 50k. Well you'd only have tax liability on 30k (instead of 40k). Again selling all of it would result in a tax on 30k which can be 0$ if you meet the IRS limits.
