Don't buy it, it's overpriced and the dividend is unsustainable. For that matter, don't buy *any* mREIT common shares unless you intend to trade them, they are too unreliable. \n\nAs a safe alternative, look at the mREIT preferred share NLYpF. It's very low risk, pays a respectable ~7% dividend and goes fixed-to-floating in less than three years, useful in a rising interest rate environment. It's the kind of share you can buy and forget at current prices. If you go that route though, familiarize yourself with preferred shares, fixed to floating, and call dates.\n\nNLY-F currently makes up 13.9% of my portfolio. I don't expect to *keep* that much, but I'm comfortable with that. There's money to be made in mREITs, but its super easy to lose money too.
