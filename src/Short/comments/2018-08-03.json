It\u2019s a patience game of 4-8% a year of growth, on average, until you\u2019re 58 or so, when it then becomes mostly bonds. Losing money happens in the tumultuous cycle that is the stock market. I bet if he held out and didn\u2019t realize his losses, he would be up on his investments overall by now. It is a slow growth process. Not to mention it is important to dollar cost average your investment for these plays over time (for any mutual fund or etf, really). It helps. But Look at the stock market over the past 20-30-40-50 years... that is your time line for retirement, (obviously in the future, though) the market has been a consistent linear line ever since it\u2019s inception. It is not a 5, or even 10 year play. Think long, long, long, term. It\u2019s a smart play to grow your money against inflation, plus gain a few points more. It\u2019s Not a get rich quick and retire early scheme. It\u2019s simple, effective, and safe. Our firm would do a mix of 70% target date,  10% bonds, 20% some sort of ETF based on aggression and risk comforts and perhaps remove some other allocations to retain 5% cash. Roughly. It\u2019s a retirement play with your retirement account, not to be used for your \u201cfun\u201d account well cuz... it\u2019s very boring haha. There are other safe substitutes for a target date fund, but to me, it is the most well-rounded option. \n\nIn regards to the growth fund vs. retirement fund, growth funds are also a great option, but they only include growth companies.

I'm still confused by what I'm seeing in the link below. \n\nIt's a 1 year comparison on yahoo finance between QQQ and TQQQ. \nIn that time the price for QQQ is up 24.39% while TQQQ is up 72.65% It's not quite 3X. But if you switch to the 2 years it's 53% vs 216%\n\nAccording to MarketWatch's historical data TQQQ from August 3rd, 2017 is 36.77. TQQQ from August 3rd 2016 was 19.71(these prices include adjustment factor for splits) The current close for TQQQ was 65.33. \n \nAccording to MarketWatch's historical data QQQ from August 3rd, 2017 is 143.65 QQQ from August 3rd 2016 was 115.34(these prices include adjustment factor for splits) The current close for QQQ was 180.07 \n \nSo it is in fact much higher today than it was on that day either 1 year ago or 2 years ago.

Four hundred thousand people,\u00a0including yours truly, put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve their spots in line so they could get their hands on that marvel as soon as it became available. It was a brilliant move by Tesla, as it provided the company $400 million of interest-free financing \u2014 the biggest crowdfunding project ever.\n\nToday, after some delays, the Model 3 is being produced. However, $35,000 seems to have been a fiction of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s imagination. Though the car is getting great reviews\u00a0from auto critics, the price for a bare-bones Model 3 starts at $49,000, and the tax incentives are fading away.\n\nBut something interesting happened recently. I received an email from Tesla that said: Model 3 is available to order, and no reservation is required in the U.S. We\u2019re now offering all our best options \u2014 including our Long Range and Performance configurations with dual motor all-wheel drive. You can design and order yours today for delivery in approximately 2\u20134 months.\n\nOn the surface this sounds like great news, except that it begs a question: What happened to 345,000 orders? Let me explain. According to Bloomberg, which has been tracking Tesla\u2019s production, to date (as of July 28, 2018) Tesla has produced 55,000 Model 3 cars. Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled \u2014 after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.\n\nThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla\u2019s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nOr two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)\n\nThere is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply [canceled](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/04/06/why-this-tesla-car-shopper-sped-away-from-the-model-3/)their orders, draining Tesla\u2019s balance sheet of $345 million.\n\n**This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla\u2019s balance sheet?**\n\nWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding. I have incredible respect for him, but he is also a magician playing a confidence game. If Musk can continue to convince the market that Tesla has a bright future, then the market will continue to finance Tesla\u2019s losses, and maybe Musk will figure out how to produce the Model 3 more cheaply and then Tesla will sell hundreds of thousands of Model 3s and the future will be as bright as Musk paints it.\n\ncontinue reading...\n\n[https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/)", "parent_text": "Questions I'd be Asking If I Owned Tesla Stock # Questions I'd be Asking If I Owned Tesla Stock\n\n**Here\u2019s a big question I\u2019d be asking if I owned Tesla stock: What happened to 345,000 reservations?**\n\nWhen Tesla\u2019s Model 3 was released, it was supposed to be a $35,000 car.

Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled \u2014 after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.\n\nThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla\u2019s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nOr two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)\n\nThere is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply [canceled](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/04/06/why-this-tesla-car-shopper-sped-away-from-the-model-3/)their orders, draining Tesla\u2019s balance sheet of $345 million.\n\n**This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla\u2019s balance sheet?**\n\nWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding.

Four hundred thousand people,\u00a0including yours truly, put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve their spots in line so they could get their hands on that marvel as soon as it became available.

You can design and order yours today for delivery in approximately 2\u20134 months.\n\nOn the surface this sounds like great news, except that it begs a question: What happened to 345,000 orders? Let me explain. According to Bloomberg, which has been tracking Tesla\u2019s production, to date (as of July 28, 2018) Tesla has produced 55,000 Model 3 cars. Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled \u2014 after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.\n\nThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla\u2019s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nOr two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)\n\nThere is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply [canceled](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/04/06/why-this-tesla-car-shopper-sped-away-from-the-model-3/)their orders, draining Tesla\u2019s balance sheet of $345 million.\n\n**This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla\u2019s balance sheet?**\n\nWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding.

Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled \u2014 after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.\n\nThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla\u2019s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nOr two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)\n\nThere is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply [canceled](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/04/06/why-this-tesla-car-shopper-sped-away-from-the-model-3/)their orders, draining Tesla\u2019s balance sheet of $345 million.\n\n**This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla\u2019s balance sheet?**\n\nWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding. I have incredible respect for him, but he is also a magician playing a confidence game. If Musk can continue to convince the market that Tesla has a bright future, then the market will continue to finance Tesla\u2019s losses, and maybe Musk will figure out how to produce the Model 3 more cheaply and then Tesla will sell hundreds of thousands of Model 3s and the future will be as bright as Musk paints it.\n\ncontinue reading...\n\n[https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/)", "parent_text": "TSLA is run on meme magic.

Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled \u2014 after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.\n\nThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla\u2019s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nOr two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)\n\nThere is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply [canceled](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/04/06/why-this-tesla-car-shopper-sped-away-from-the-model-3/)their orders, draining Tesla\u2019s balance sheet of $345 million.\n\n**This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla\u2019s balance sheet?**\n\nWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding. I have incredible respect for him, but he is also a magician playing a confidence game. If Musk can continue to convince the market that Tesla has a bright future, then the market will continue to finance Tesla\u2019s losses, and maybe Musk will figure out how to produce the Model 3 more cheaply and then Tesla will sell hundreds of thousands of Model 3s and the future will be as bright as Musk paints it.\n\ncontinue reading...\n\n[https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/)", "parent_text": "Its not all based on a wrong assumption.

Four hundred thousand people,\u00a0including yours truly, put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve their spots in line so they could get their hands on that marvel as soon as it became available. It was a brilliant move by Tesla, as it provided the company $400 million of interest-free financing \u2014 the biggest crowdfunding project ever.\n\nToday, after some delays, the Model 3 is being produced. However, $35,000 seems to have been a fiction of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s imagination. Though the car is getting great reviews\u00a0from auto critics, the price for a bare-bones Model 3 starts at $49,000, and the tax incentives are fading away.\n\nBut something interesting happened recently. I received an email from Tesla that said: Model 3 is available to order, and no reservation is required in the U.S. We\u2019re now offering all our best options \u2014 including our Long Range and Performance configurations with dual motor all-wheel drive.

Will these people hold and show confidence in the company long term or will they near immediately cash out and imply their lack of confidence in the company the moment they\u2019re given the opportunity to? That\u2019s a major question and will likely have a fair deal of influence on how the stock looks and performs to finish out 2018.\n\nI personally think IQ is a great pick for someone willing to hold it for years and able to handle the volatility. There are going to be some weeks where it will be up double digits and other weeks where it will be down double digits. It\u2019s a foreign, tech/entertainment type company that\u2019s in its early days so it\u2019s going to get wild in the short term (<3 years). We\u2019re still very much in the early days of this company. It\u2019s also in a country going through it\u2019s own problems which brings me to my next point.\n\nA big concern is the country in which they reside in; China. China has some pretty serious concerns going on right now despite an enormous amount of potential. They have credit, real estate, and trade problems and concerns along with some behind the scenes political issues as well. The Chinese market had a nice run for a little while there but 2018 hasn\u2019t been kind to it thus far and we\u2019re likely to see some more turmoil in the short term. This will only further complicate and impact a company like IQ.\n\nCompetition is another thing to consider. They aren\u2019t the only video streaming platform in China and one of their biggest competitors has the backing of Chinese giant Tencent. Regardless, I think with China\u2019s massive population there is enough room for multiple successful companies in the sector and country.\n\nI hold IQ and will continue to. China has a growing middle class and its middle class alone near rivals the size of the entire US population. More then a third of the country lacks regular and reliable access to the internet but this figure is improving, leaving additional untapped potential out there. A big concern was how much of their subscribers were actually paying customers and it turned out almost all of them were besides a small percentage. Their subscription numbers grew big time as showcased in the most recent earnings report. They have the backing of a few big, well established, and connected companies. They provide some of the biggest and most popular shows/movies in China and the number of people watching these shows on a regular basis competes with the numbers major events (think Super Bowls) in the US see only a few times a year.\n\nThe most important thing for IQ is that they continue to grow their base and become more efficient while trying to profit off their platform. All things easier said than done and being in a country struggling with its own demons doesn\u2019t make things any easier. They have a lot to like about them but there are certainly some big concerns and huddles they have to beat. I think as long as you understand the risk and realize it will be a frustrating, wild ride with lots of volatility then it\u2019s a reasonable gamble that could pay off big time if it\u2019s successful.\n\nIf you can do and understand those things and still want to invest in IQ then you\u2019ll have to ask yourself the following question. Will those shareholders hold come September? If you think most will hold or at least that a decent chunk of them won\u2019t sell all or most of their shares, then now or some time over the next couple weeks probably isn\u2019t a bad time to jump in. If you\u2019re not sure and aren\u2019t fully confident in the company but still on the edge, I\u2019d wait until September to see what happens and then reevaluate your position and thoughts.\n\nI\u2019ve said it a few times but want to stress it, do not hold IQ if you think you\u2019ll panic and sell if things get rough or if you struggle with some fairly extreme volatility.

Instead of calculating the average price of a stock alone, you also factor in the volume (# of shares) traded during each price. \nFor example, if a stock was trading at $10 for 5 minutes, then it traded for $20 for another 5 minutes, its average price would be $15.\n\nHowever, let's say we used volume as a weight for the average. If at $10, 25 shares were traded, and then at $20, 75 shares were traded (for a total of 100 shares traded), then your VWAP is $17.50 instead of $15.\n\nAs for why the order is executed \"close to\" the VWAP rather than \"above or below,\" the reason is that the goal is to complete the entire order without causing huge swings in the price of the stock. \n\nFor your final question about the large sell order, your sell order will be split into even intervals (such as every 5 mins, every 1 hour, etc.) and whenever there is more buying volume than usual, you will offload more share, while when there is weaker buying volume, you will sell fewer shares to prevent a steep drop in price of the stock. Once all of your shares are sold near your VWAP, then your order is done.\n\nThat's my understanding, but if anyone knows I'm wrong, feel free to point it out.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1533913057.0, "submission_id": "94fvzn", "comment_id": "e3yb20r", "body": "> These are strategies used by large funds to minimize the impact of their trades on the market price, and have no use to retail traders unless you're playing with ten million+ dollars.\n> \n> Without these algorithms, if a large fund wants to buy or sell a large amount of shares, they'll move the price up or down by huge percentages.

There are 6.7 million shares outstanding. 6,700,000 \\* .07 = 469,000 \n\nthat said, market cap goes up when share price increases.

It means the company is so big that if it fails it could create a financial disaster for the entire country.  Years ago there was a list of banks made that were too big to fail, I believe the fed put together the research, but it wasn't supposed to be disclosed.  The reason they didn't want it disclosed is then every bank on that list would know if they failed the government would likely have to bail them out to avoid a catastrophic financial crisis.  If/when the banks knew this then they'd make riskier and riskier decisions.   For example we could allow Tier One to, fail, but not larger banks.  \n\nBubbles tend to form in the market when nobody knows it's a bubble, same goes with many financial crises.    Sure some people predicted it, but these are the same people that have predicted 20 out of the past 2 economic crises if you get my drift.  Usually we learn from our lessons but that doesn't mean we won't have something bad happen that's different from the past.  For example the last recession mostly caused by mortgage backed securities is something most people thought wasn't possible, and this wasn't a hotly debated issue, almost everyone agreed a housing bubble couldn't exist, but we found out it definitely did.  In 2001 we had the dot com bubble.  In the 80's we had stagflation, all of them are different phenomena that are difficult to predict if not impossible.\n\nBusinesses failing and others building off that failure is very common.  It's just hard to know which business will succeed and which will fail.\n\nMy question then for you is, do you think hedge fund managers are better educated than you on the markets?  Have more resources?  Yes, and they rarely if ever beat the markets.\n\nI'm sure your reply will be \"Well Warren Buffet does it.\"  That's true, he does.  However, he has access to deals that we can't get.  He has a 20 billion dollar war chest to dispense, and he oftentimes DOES NOT PAY THE SAME PRICE FOR THE SAME STOCK AS YOU!!!!  He often times gets interests in companies by entering in different deals to get it at a discount compared to what the market pays.\n\nIf a real fund manager has a hard time beating the markets, I have a very hard time believing somebody who doesn't even understand what too big too fail means has a chance in beating them based on skill, you could certainly get lucky and beat the market, however it's almost impossible to do that over a long period of time.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Why own individual stocks", "submission_text": "We\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s nearly impossible to beat the market.
