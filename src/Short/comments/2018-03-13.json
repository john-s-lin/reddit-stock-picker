Take a look at this chart, it is an earnings chart https://imgur.com/a/mMul5 \n\nIf you notice earnings growth was pretty bad 2015 into 2016. Subsequently wall street assumed this was going to continue. So most of wall street was too bearish for 2017. Now coming into 2018 most of wall street is overly bullish just like they were bearish in 2017. \n\nThe difference now is in 2017 your earnings growth was coming from a much lower level (some negative earnings comps). But now earnings comps are running up against harder comps. \n\nSo you have wall street overly bullish because they were wrong about 2017. They are overly short treasuries as they think growth is going to go through the roof because they made the wrong call in 2017. You also had a massive short position in the VIX which is what caused the decline to be so severe in feb. And you've got a good chance to see growth slow in rate of change terms (y/y growth slowing), meaning people are positioned wrongly. \n\nThis with the backdrop of china which is slowing, and europe slowing. Doesn't play well for equity markets. I don't think it's 2008, I don't think anyone can actually call a 2008 market. But there are lots of people in positions that they shouldn't be in and thus we will likely see some volatility going forward as there are short squeezes and people are forced to sell because they are too long of something. \n\nBonds should do well. And actually the dollar is an interesting long here. Note someone bought over 2,000 contracts of UUP September ex and $25 strike today. \n\nI think we whipsaw around a lot and people freak out every time trump does anything. \n\nFull disclosure, I sold 50% of my holdings (SPY) Friday at the close and 50% of my holdings (SPY) monday morning right after the open.

My aunt who I was really close to had died of cancer after some brutal attempts at treatment with no real chance of cures so the company not only interested me from an investing standpoint but also on a personal aspect and level as well. Besides Apple and Berkshire, they were the first individual company I brought stock in that wasn\u2019t a household name so as you can imagine I was still fairly inexperienced and green in terms of investing in individual companies. \n\nAnyways so I brought in at like $25, stock went up to low 40s and I panicked in excitement and sold all of it. My fear was that I would be too greedy and end up losing out so I wanted to take my winnings now. I only had like 2k in company so it wasn\u2019t big money but the price of them now is over $85!! I still follow the company and it holds a special place in my heart as corny as that sounds. I really hope their cancer treatments continue making progress. \n\nKnowing when to get out and not being greedy is important in this game but patience is also extremely important as well.

My aunt who I was really close to had died of cancer after some brutal attempts at treatment with no real chance of cures so the company not only interested me from an investing standpoint but also on a personal aspect and level as well. Besides Apple and Berkshire, they were the first individual company I brought stock in that wasn\u2019t a household name so as you can imagine I was still fairly inexperienced and green in terms of investing in individual companies. \n\nAnyways so I brought in at like $25, stock went up to low 40s and I panicked in excitement and sold all of it. My fear was that I would be too greedy and end up losing out so I wanted to take my winnings now. I only had like 2k in company so it wasn\u2019t big money but the price of them now is over $85!! I still follow the company and it holds a special place in my heart as corny as that sounds. I really hope their cancer treatments continue making progress. \n\nKnowing when to get out and not being greedy is important in this game but patience is also extremely important as well.

Higher volumes provide more liquidity. This means that once your stop loss is hit you're more likely to find a trader to buy from you near that price. You're also more likely to find a seller offering a fair price for when you want to enter.\n\nMost ETF providers will balance the price at the close of the trading day, presumably by taking opposite positions on the market to offset the gains of their customers. The provider makes money purely off the management fee, just like a bookie in sports betting. During the day the provider is going to offer bid and ask prices around the underlying intrinsic value (often referred to as NAV). They purposefully keep the spread wide to encourage trader involvement. If you see a tight spread that typically means you are trading with real buyers and sellers. When the spread is wide, no one has to buy or sell at those marked-up prices. If you are dependent on a stop loss what can happen is that no trades occur until the ask is so far below your SL that when it does get filled your SL is really hurting. You then have to give up your shares at much lower than what you had planned. Some people know this and purposefully hunt for SLs.\n\nWhat all this means is that only higher volume issues like SPY can be daytraded.

It already cut the dividend last year and the current dividend yield is most likely still unsustainable.\n\n3. The dividend isn't free money; the amount is taken out of the share price and if you choose to reinvest is automatically reinvested via DRIP.\n\n4. So many people think a huge dividend yield is automatically good then they don't bother to look at company fundamentals. Always, always look at fundamentals first. The dividend isn't going to mean much if the company is total garbage and the stock price has basically cratered as has been the case here.  Additionally, given how the company has done, why would I want to reinvest and have more of this? The other issue here becomes if they cut the dividend further then you're going to see a further exodus of investors as the only thing this seems to have going for it is yield.\n\n5.
