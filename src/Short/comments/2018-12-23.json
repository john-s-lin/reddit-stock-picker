We are a joke to the Chinese and I\u2019m afraid they are going to win the war with this Belt and Road Initiative because the European Union is no better off than we are.

It\u2019s almost like a flat tax I guess since it\u2019s based on consumption of electronics, etc. In the end, we\u2019ve been borrowing from the communists to give us freedom to not balance the books as a country even though millions of U.S. households HAVE to do that every month. We are a joke to the Chinese and I\u2019m afraid they are going to win the war with this Belt and Road Initiative because the European Union is no better off than we are.

By gaining access to countries starving for money with the creation of the Belt and Road Initiative.

To me this is like the Chinese devaluing their currency to benefit their objectives. \n\nThe largest transfer of wealth occurred when homes in the US eventually were taken away from the middle class through mortgage loan default and sold to huge funds for the purpose of renting them out. The result is, ten years later, we have harder standards to meet for average Americans to buy homes and fewer owning homes. There goes the idea of wealth creation and retirement security because we all know social security isn\u2019t going to be around forever. The only advantage the little guy got was being punished for paying his mortgage on time by buying what he could afford in the form of his home values crashing. Or he got to stay in a home for three years, rent free, because the banks couldn\u2019t process all the broken loans any quicker. I hope those three years gave the little guy a chance to save some money for a new mortgage down payment because the 20% down is a big nut. By the looks of things, according to statistics, many didn\u2019t save. Homeownership is down and developers are building rental units as quickly as they can.

How about we ask ourselves a few questions like what level would the market likely be at today if QE never happened and is our GDP forecast based on history from a QE infused economy? If the answer to the second question is yes, we\u2019re fu\u20acked. \n\nIt seems to me we are at war.  The Chinese are a communist/socialist/ lets-pretend-we\u2019re-capitalists led country. We\u2019ve got people here worried about air quality but we\u2019ve sold our soul to the Chinese business man who doesn\u2019t give a sh!t about air quality at the moment. We float our markets when we\u2019re scared and we\u2019re fascinated with goods created by child labor we can\u2019t see or don\u2019t want to because they\u2019re cheap. Whose country is based on a free market, ours? What does it matter when the Chinese own more American Dollars when we do? The world is upside down and I only see the Chinese getting ahead.  Their quality of living standards has gone up while ours, not so much. \n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? You\u2019re not going to like this. We either join the party and accept that China eventually will be THE world financial power or you don\u2019t. The way I see it is their long term goals outweigh anything any president can do because their game is long term. We come across as directionally challenged. \n\nOnce the world is dependent on them for just about EVERYTHING, what do we have left?  We will be making goods for them eventually, at rock bottom prices because their populous with be vibrant and not willing to work cheaply.

The Chinese have figured out our weaknesses and built a plan around them. Our weaknesses are manifested through our actions as an economical aggregate force. We need to fight this problem with the very problem it is- economics. But it may be too late because our population makes us less powerful in the game of economics compared to other countries popping out babies quicker than we are.

We have to seclude ourselves if we are to combat the inevitable China King paradigm. Being a part of the world isn\u2019t helping us.

I don\u2019t blame trump for hurting the Chinese economy right now with tariffs.  We have to do it now while we still have influence to do so. Once this Belt and Road Initiative is complete, we won\u2019t have the economical influence we have currently.

Because the Americans, we Americans, don\u2019t want to be confused with the facts, the truth is the tariffs will come back on us in the form of pricier products we consume. It\u2019s a brilliant plan. Trump looks like he\u2019s standing up to the Chinese, making them pay for our debt which they own, in turn that messes with their economy and in essence raises taxes for us at the same time but without us knowing it because it wasn\u2019t paraded in front of us through Congress .

We are a joke to the Chinese and I\u2019m afraid they are going to win the war with this Belt and Road Initiative because the European Union is no better off than we are. They don\u2019t have the luxury of borrowing without giving more than just interest in euros. \n\nI\u2019m no writer, as you can obviously tell.  But I do think about these things and they bother me.  I\u2019ve worked long and hard in a unusual business that forces me to be the best in order to survive while battling ageism every day . I have nothing to fall back on except my savings.  I try to grow them using instruments like real estate and stocks/options. So far both instruments are ailing.  I guess this turned out to be a rambling rant and I apologize for that.  2019 isn\u2019t looking to be good for US equities.  I guess I\u2019ll keep those rental units a few years longer I was going to sell in January.  I\u2019m only making 7.9% annually before aggregating tax benefits through accelerated depreciation, etc. but it sure beats the 40% down my portofolio is currently. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "parent_text": "I lost you at the emoji", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": -0.5}, {"time": 1545611715.0, "submission_id": "a8xz71", "comment_id": "ecfdh0r", "body": "Will do brother", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 0.3333333333333333, "submission_title": "Belt & Road Initiative and my bigger picture thoughts.", "submission_text": "Don\u2019t confuse me with the facts.

It will serve 70% of the worlds population with Chinese goods through 90 countries as partners. WTO who? \n\nChina took advantage of the financial crisis in Europe and created an opportunity for themselves.  By gaining access to countries starving for money with the creation of the Belt and Road Initiative. They got great deals at bargain prices along with political influence to be used in the future for anything they want. These countries now owe China and they will collect through strong arming. It\u2019s already apparent when several European Union members cast objections to voices concerned with China\u2019s actions in the South China Seas, for example. \n\nIn the US of A, Capitalistic markets were screwed by greed which became manifest as a housing loan crisis. Thank you, to the system that allowed everyone who shouldn\u2019t have but did get a mortgage they couldn\u2019t afford. To combat a worse outcome, the federal reserve floated the banks with Quantitative Easing. This isn\u2019t free market behavior. To me this is like the Chinese devaluing their currency to benefit their objectives. \n\nThe largest transfer of wealth occurred when homes in the US eventually were taken away from the middle class through mortgage loan default and sold to huge funds for the purpose of renting them out. The result is, ten years later, we have harder standards to meet for average Americans to buy homes and fewer owning homes. There goes the idea of wealth creation and retirement security because we all know social security isn\u2019t going to be around forever. The only advantage the little guy got was being punished for paying his mortgage on time by buying what he could afford in the form of his home values crashing. Or he got to stay in a home for three years, rent free, because the banks couldn\u2019t process all the broken loans any quicker. I hope those three years gave the little guy a chance to save some money for a new mortgage down payment because the 20% down is a big nut. By the looks of things, according to statistics, many didn\u2019t save. Homeownership is down and developers are building rental units as quickly as they can. What does that tell you?\n\nWe bailed out the banks and flooded the market with free money which elevated share prices across the board.  And now we see finally more people are working and finally have a chance to catch up, make more money with wage increases and what happens? We raise the interest rates, market is going down, future business spending on development will be slowed, middle class is waning and millennials are in for an education with student loan debt which many say is the next big financial crisis when they realize the machine their in doesn\u2019t give a sh!t about them. \n\nHere\u2019s what makes me laugh out loud, we\u2019ve got talking heads who are clueless as to why the market is dropping. How about we ask ourselves a few questions like what level would the market likely be at today if QE never happened and is our GDP forecast based on history from a QE infused economy? If the answer to the second question is yes, we\u2019re fu\u20acked. \n\nIt seems to me we are at war.  The Chinese are a communist/socialist/ lets-pretend-we\u2019re-capitalists led country. We\u2019ve got people here worried about air quality but we\u2019ve sold our soul to the Chinese business man who doesn\u2019t give a sh!t about air quality at the moment. We float our markets when we\u2019re scared and we\u2019re fascinated with goods created by child labor we can\u2019t see or don\u2019t want to because they\u2019re cheap. Whose country is based on a free market, ours? What does it matter when the Chinese own more American Dollars when we do? The world is upside down and I only see the Chinese getting ahead.  Their quality of living standards has gone up while ours, not so much. \n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? You\u2019re not going to like this. We either join the party and accept that China eventually will be THE world financial power or you don\u2019t. The way I see it is their long term goals outweigh anything any president can do because their game is long term. We come across as directionally challenged. \n\nOnce the world is dependent on them for just about EVERYTHING, what do we have left?  We will be making goods for them eventually, at rock bottom prices because their populous with be vibrant and not willing to work cheaply. Life is like a pendulum; maybe our best days ARE behind us for the next 200 years. I can\u2019t see what China\u2019s long term goal is other than this and if my financial retirement security is to be safeguarded, maybe emerging markets is the way to go. \n\nIt seems to me everything we esteem is being thrown in our faces because of our own unbridled nature. The Chinese have figured out our weaknesses and built a plan around them. Our weaknesses are manifested through our actions as an economical aggregate force. We need to fight this problem with the very problem it is- economics. But it may be too late because our population makes us less powerful in the game of economics compared to other countries popping out babies quicker than we are.  If we don\u2019t do everything in-house, how can we combat the sunami wave coming at us that\u2019s filled with refuse in the names of communism, blind eye to reality, abhorrent labor laws, inequality, pollution up the Wazoo, a \u201cgimme mine, don\u2019t care about you\u201d hustler mentality, and plain anthropocentric paradigms including the many ego types running the world. We have to seclude ourselves if we are to combat the inevitable China King paradigm. Being a part of the world isn\u2019t helping us.  I know this idea will have lots of flak but I really see it that way. We either give in and make the best of it or turn a drastic corner.  I don\u2019t blame trump for hurting the Chinese economy right now with tariffs.  We have to do it now while we still have influence to do so. Once this Belt and Road Initiative is complete, we won\u2019t have the economical influence we have currently. Timing is crucial. \n\nNo one president has had the courage to be suicidal and tell the American Public what it doesn\u2019t want to hear.  Only a communist government leader has that luxury.  Because the Americans, we Americans, don\u2019t want to be confused with the facts, the truth is the tariffs will come back on us in the form of pricier products we consume. It\u2019s a brilliant plan. Trump looks like he\u2019s standing up to the Chinese, making them pay for our debt which they own, in turn that messes with their economy and in essence raises taxes for us at the same time but without us knowing it because it wasn\u2019t paraded in front of us through Congress .
