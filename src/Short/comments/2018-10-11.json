Just make sure you keep your job and continue contributing. \n\nIf you don't sell and hold an index fund you can do pretty good. Buying stocks is a bigger risk. I'd recommend have a significant portion of your portfolio in a fund, either global or S&P tracking, then throw some money in high potential stocks.\n\nObviously, I do the opposite, with only options, but I like high risk because scared money makes no money, but seriously, to start, index funds are a good way to go, with DCA and re balancing between equities/bonds.

My personal take is that it's unlikely to be one of the other here. I see no good reason why the two companies couldn't both have a healthy user base with a slightly different focus.\n\nFor example I know a lot of younger kids who love using SNAP to stay in touch with their friends. I don't see any of them using Instagram. Although I don't use it, Instagram seems to be more geared towards older teens and adults (which is smart because that's where the money is), but I think SNAP can still exist as a slightly more lowbrow photo sharing service along side Instagram.\n\nIt's like arguing Facebook will kill Twitter, or that Amazon will kill the high street, or that Apple will kill Samsung. These companies certainly compete, and it's likely one of them will become the denominate player in their market, but often these markets will naturally have a few players with a couple of bigger names.\n\nMy main concern with SNAP personally is their CEO. He seems to have ambitions a little too large considering he owns a photo sharing app that people use primarily to share silly photos and nude pictures with each other. Yet he's trying to break into AR and position the company as one of the big names in tech.\n\nPersonally I think SNAP would be better off if they just admitted defeat to Instagram. If they stopped investing in stupid hardware projects and focused on marking a fun photosharing app for teens they could probably lock in their user base then start focusing on turning a profit. When they've done that perhaps then it would make sense for them to explore other opportunities, but I'd strongly recommend them sticking to what they're good at already, like building popular apps for teens and young adults.\n\nI think it all relies on Spiegel. I don't think Instagram is the main concern here, it's Spiegel's complete lack of focus. He released a statement a few days ago which suggested they wanted to target older users going forward instead of continuing to develop the app for their current user base whom made SNAP a success in the first place. I see little chance in him bringing people back over from Instagram, but I think it's quite likely he'll end up pissing the current user base off enough that they start moving to another app.", "score": 4, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 61, "submission_ratio": 0.06557377049180328, "submission_title": "$SNAP", "submission_text": "After a Green Day.

This time, apple even created dual sim phones for the Indian and Chinese markets. \nHowever, the Snap ceo bad mouthed India saying its too poor for snap. Imagine that, saying that the country with the most iphones sold is not good enough. \n\nBesides being ethically wrong, that statement shows the lack of respect Snap has for its users. They are too incompetent to run surveys. \n\nAs a web developer, I know that UX testing is a major part of a platforms success. If Snap had used a beta access program to role out their new UI, they would have realised how bad it is.

My personal take is that it's unlikely to be one of the other here. I see no good reason why the two companies couldn't both have a healthy user base with a slightly different focus.\n\nFor example I know a lot of younger kids who love using SNAP to stay in touch with their friends. I don't see any of them using Instagram. Although I don't use it, Instagram seems to be more geared towards older teens and adults (which is smart because that's where the money is), but I think SNAP can still exist as a slightly more lowbrow photo sharing service along side Instagram.\n\nIt's like arguing Facebook will kill Twitter, or that Amazon will kill the high street, or that Apple will kill Samsung. These companies certainly compete, and it's likely one of them will become the denominate player in their market, but often these markets will naturally have a few players with a couple of bigger names.\n\nMy main concern with SNAP personally is their CEO. He seems to have ambitions a little too large considering he owns a photo sharing app that people use primarily to share silly photos and nude pictures with each other. Yet he's trying to break into AR and position the company as one of the big names in tech.\n\nPersonally I think SNAP would be better off if they just admitted defeat to Instagram. If they stopped investing in stupid hardware projects and focused on marking a fun photosharing app for teens they could probably lock in their user base then start focusing on turning a profit. When they've done that perhaps then it would make sense for them to explore other opportunities, but I'd strongly recommend them sticking to what they're good at already, like building popular apps for teens and young adults.\n\nI think it all relies on Spiegel. I don't think Instagram is the main concern here, it's Spiegel's complete lack of focus. He released a statement a few days ago which suggested they wanted to target older users going forward instead of continuing to develop the app for their current user base whom made SNAP a success in the first place. I see little chance in him bringing people back over from Instagram, but I think it's quite likely he'll end up pissing the current user base off enough that they start moving to another app.", "parent_score": 4, "parent_ratio": 0.25}, {"time": 1539377292.0, "submission_id": "9nfd7e", "comment_id": "e7np4ok", "body": "When they came out with stories they had 400M. \n\nAlso, their revenue model sucks so bad that they cant even turn those 188M into a good enoihh profit. \n\nDAU isnt everything if you dont monetize right.
