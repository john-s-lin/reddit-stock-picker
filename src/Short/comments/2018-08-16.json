It's nuts.\"\n\nThe issue that I have with CVS and Walgreens is that that's how they got ya. You needed something so you run over/stop by/whatever to the local CVS/Walgreens and pay silly amounts for things that are (increasingly) cheaper elsewhere.\n\nFor a long time, they could get away with that. Now you have Amazon Prime Now in an increasing amount of cities, Target Restock, Kroger Ship. Increasingly, those things are going to provide convenience at a reasonable price (not only are they bringing it to you, but prices are less than Walgreens/CVS) and people don't have to go to the stores (which in the case of both Walgreens and CVS are often nothing great.) I don't see Walgreens or CVS going away tomorrow by any means, but I do have a view of a continued slow decline with things being as they are.\n\nAdditionally - and I've mentioned this in other threads - CVS/Walgreens generic OTC meds are absurdly expensive. For Claritin,  I can buy 30 \"Wal-itin\" for $19. I can buy 300 of Amazon's brand on Amazon for $13. Someone buys 300 for $13 and not only did they get a WAY better deal, they're not going to need to make a quick stop for it at a Walgreens or CVS for a while.\n\nSo again, I don't think that CVS or Walgreens is going away, but I think they need to make the case of where they fit in years ahead and whether or not they will eventually have to compete on price, how they can compete on delivery (I think Walgreens was with Google Express, I'm not sure Google Express is even still a thing I never hear about it.)\n\nCVS is now working with Teladoc, but Teladoc broadly is another reason not to come into the store for the minute clinic. Amazon bought Pillpack so there's that.\n\nPeople say, \"Well, Amazon!\" in regards to the drugstores but I don't know; I think that there's more to it than that. I think that these stores charged an excessive amount for everyday things because they had the convenience going for them. Now that there's an increasing amount of things that deliver quickly, that is going to erode going forward.\n\nCVS has other things going for it, but I think the stores are a concern over the longer-term.\n\n\n\n", "score": 4, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 6, "submission_ratio": 0.6666666666666666, "submission_title": "Thoughts on price targets for CVS and PG?", "submission_text": "I finally returned to break-even.
