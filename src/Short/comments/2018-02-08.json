From Wikipedia:\n>\"Dollar cost averaging is not the same thing as continuous, automatic investing. This confusion of terms is perpetuated by some articles (AARP,Motley Fool) and specifically noted by others (Vanguard). The argued weakness of DCA arises in the context of having the option to invest a lump sum, but choosing to use DCA instead. If the market is expected to trend upwards over time, DCA can conversely be expected to face a statistical headwind: the investor is choosing to invest at a future time rather than today, even though future prices are expected to be higher. But most individual investors, especially in the context of retirement investing, never face a choice between lump sum investing and DCA investing with a significant amount of money. The disservice arises when these investors take the criticisms of DCA to mean that timing the market is better than continuously and automatically investing a portion of their income as they earn it. For example, stopping one's retirement investment contributions during a declining market on account of the argued weaknesses of DCA would indicate a misunderstanding of those arguments.\"\n\n\nSo carry on with the downvotes now...", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 182, "submission_ratio": 0.01098901098901099, "submission_title": "Everybody right now", "submission_text": "\"I won't jump in till the market starts doing well again\"\n**Market starts doing well**\n\"I'm afraid to jump in, everything is overvalued and too expensive, I'm gonna wait for a crash\"", "parent_text": "> If you invest X% of your paycheck every month then no, that's not DCA.\n\nI don't think you understand what DCA is.", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.4}, {"time": 1518187425.0, "submission_id": "7w52qx", "comment_id": "dtzickf", "body": "[removed]", "score": 0, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 182, "submission_ratio": 0.0, "submission_title": "Everybody right now", "submission_text": "\"I won't jump in till the market starts doing well again\"\n**Market starts doing well**\n\"I'm afraid to jump in, everything is overvalued and too expensive, I'm gonna wait for a crash\"", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 0.0}, {"time": 1518151823.0, "submission_id": "7w52qx", "comment_id": "dtyz2o7", "body": "Would you mind sharing your fav stocks?
