He developed the CANSLIM method which provides a quantitative way of looking at stocks. Here's a good video and write-up about that process. I pulled this from www.robinhoodstrategy.com.  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XFXqh\\_5N4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XFXqh_5N4)  \n\n\nThe Elements of CAN SLIM\n\nThe seven letters in the CAN SLIM acronym stand for the key traits O\u2019Neil found that stocks display just before they make their biggest price gains. CAN SLIM combines both quantitative and qualitative stock assessment into one easy to remember mnemonic device, it is described below.\n\n### C = Current Quarterly Earnings\n\nSubstantial\u00a0earnings-per-share\u00a0growth can attract the large institutional players \u2013 something that can fuel big price moves. According to CAN SLIM, investors should look for companies with a minimum quarterly EPS growth of 25% in the most recent quarter \u2013 though gains of 50% to 100% are even more attractive. Of course, you want those gains to be sustainable, so the company should also have at least 20% sales growth in the most recent quarter and a minimum 17% return on equity.\n\n### A = Annual Earnings Growth\n\nWhile good quarterly earnings are important, a company should also boast strong annual earnings growth. This can help confirm that the company doesn\u2019t have any underlying problems, such as falling demand for its products, deteriorating profit margins or negative industry trends. CAN SLIM investors look for an annual EPS growth rate of at least 25% to 50% in each of the previous three to five years. Remember there is no good reason to hold a company\u2019s stock if its earnings are declining. **STOCKS FOLLOW EARNINGS!**\n\n***C + A = QUANTITATIVE***  \n*The first two parts of the CAN SLIM system\u00a0\u2013 strong quarterly and annual earnings\u00a0\u2013 are\u00a0logical steps employing\u00a0quantitative analysis.*\u00a0\n\n### N = New Product or Service\n\nThe third trait that CAN SLIM investors look for is something new in the company \u2013 whether that\u2019s a new product, service, CEO or high stock price, or an innovative industry trend that benefits the company in some way.\u00a0Wall Street\u00a0is always on the prowl for the next best thing, whether that\u2019s an entrepreneurial company disrupting an industry or an established company that reinvents itself by pivoting to new products. Something new can equate to profits for years to come, and sometimes decades.\n\n***Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)***  \nA perfect example of how newness can create success can be seen in Domino\u2019s Pizza (**DPZ**). After gaining a reputation during the early 2000s as the worst pizza chain, Domino\u2019s went through a major shift in late 2009. The company came out and blatantly acknowledged that its pizza was awful, and it was committed to upgrading the product. On top of rebranding, the company also looked to upgrade its mobile delivery system. With the implementation of these changes, Domino\u2019s has seen its share price climb over 3300% since 2009. This is just one of many compelling examples of companies that\u00a0\u2013\u00a0through doing or acquiring something new\u00a0\u2013\u00a0achieved great things and rewarded their\u00a0shareholders\u00a0along the way.\n\n### S = Supply and Demand\n\nThe\u00a0law of supply and demand\u00a0governs all market activities: strong demand for a limited supply of available shares will drive price up, and an oversupply of shares coupled with weak demand will drive price down. CAN SLIM investors watch for sharp price increases backed by spikes in trading volume. These events indicate demand \u2013 especially from mutual fund managers and other institutional investors \u2013 that can lead to even bigger price moves.\n\n### L = Leader or Laggard\n\nIn any industry, there are companies that lead and provide big gains to shareholders, and companies that lag and deliver gains that are at best mediocre. The idea is to buy leaders and avoid laggards; CAN SLIM investors look at the\u00a0relative price strength\u00a0of a stock to differentiate between the two. A stock\u2019s relative price strength ranges from one to 99;\u00a0a rank of 75, for example, means the company has outperformed 75% of the stocks in its market group over a particular period of time. CAN SLIM investors look for stocks that have relative price strengths of at least 70 \u2013 though stocks in the 80 to 90 range are generally more likely to be the major gainers.\n\n### I = Institutional Sponsorship\n\nThis trait refers to whether the stock is owned by banks, mutual funds, pension funds and other\u00a0institutional investors. Such ownership\u00a0can be viewed as positive confirmation of a potential winner. Professional investors have teams of analysts who research thousands of potential investments. When one of them starts buying a stock you\u2019re considering, it can increase demand for the stock \u2013 and potentially trigger rising share prices. CAN SLIM investors should focus on stocks that have at least three to 10 institutional owners.\n\n### M = Market Direction\n\nThe final trait in the CAN SLIM model is market direction. When picking stocks, it\u2019s always important to recognize whether you are in a bull or bear market. CAN SLIM investors believe you should invest with the market, as opposed to against it. The theory here is that, according to CAN SLIM, three out of four stocks move in the same direction as the general market \u2013 as measured by the major indices (the NASDAQ Composite, the S&P 500 and the DJIA). If you buy a stock when the market is in an uptrend, the theory goes, you have a 75% chance of being right; conversely, you have a 75% chance of being wrong if you buy when the market is in a downtrend.", "score": 36, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 418, "submission_ratio": 0.0861244019138756, "submission_title": "Are there any good YouTube channels that teach investments starting from basic terminology and working into strategies?", "submission_text": "Thinking along the lines of a Khan Academy for investments \n\nI\u2019m an accountant with good understanding of how to read financial statements/financial terminology\n\nWhat I don\u2019t know is all the financial formulas and how they affect stock value, general behaviors the stock market, etc.", "parent_text": "Are there any good YouTube channels that teach investments starting from basic terminology and working into strategies?

At the after-hours price on Tuesday, it reached $995 billion in market cap and could shortly become the world's first $1 trillion public company.\n\nThe company grew its quarterly revenue and EPS by +17% and +40% year-over-year, in line with Wall Street estimates. Next quarter's guidance was also above estimates.\n\nMore important for Apple's future business and financial prospects is the complexion of that performance. Let's dive into how this quarter and management's guidance reflect Apple's two most fundamental moats: brand equity and network effects.\n\n**First, on the hardware front:**\n\nMany were hanging high hopes on Apple's flagship handset (the iPhone, which is 60% of Apple's revenue) and its climbing ASP. This quarter, the company delivered. The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during Q3 is basically flat from last year, but the average selling price of $724 is a notable jump. This bump is likely due to an increasing mix of the pricier iPhone X, which starts at $999.\n\nOur main takeaway from this robust pricing growth is that Apple continues to improve its brand equity and expand its pricing power. In a world of ever-increasing selection of lower-priced Android phones and already-high Apple penetration, Apple is undoubtedly seeing its iPhone unit sales growth slow. But the company is building digital services and a suite of other gadgets around the device. Those newer businesses, along with higher price iPhones, are widening Apple's brand equity and supporting continued pricing power and revenue growth. And pricing power, as Buffett often puts it, is the \"holy grail\" in investing.\n\n**Next, on the software front:**\n\nInvestors have been watching closely as Apple ups its software and services revenue -- a catch-all category that includes the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud services. This segment has been outpacing iPhone revenue growth for several quarters.\n\nApple positively surprised with $9.55 billion in software and services revenue this quarter (+31% growth). We think there's still tremendous opportunity left for growth in this sticky, high-margin app/developer ecosystem. The reason (and the moat): network effects.\n\nAs Apple acquires more iPhone users from a hardware perspective, it grows the distribution channel through which app developers sell/offer their apps. This is great for developers because it widens their consumer audiences, and it's great for consumers because it widens the selection of apps, software and other services to make the smartphone experience more rich and engaging. As each side of the network grows in size, so does the value that each side of the network gets out of it.\n\nCEO Tim Cook said in January 2017 that the company hoped to double services revenue to more than $14 billion per quarter by 2020. That's almost 50% higher than Apple's current sales for that segment. Oh and it's a much higher margin business than iPhones too (because it costs almost nothing to plug a new developer into the App Store ecosystem, vs. the hardware that goes into an iPhone).\n\n**Finally, on the forward-looking guidance:**\n\nApple expects Q3 revenue to come between $60-62 billion (+23% growth), edging out Wall Street predictions of $59.5 billion.\n\nRecall that the company's recent quarterly results have been weighed down by concerns that it has saturated the smartphone market, marking the end of the iPhone \"supercycle.\" The next quarter (fiscal Q4) is when Apple typically introduces new iPhone models -- usually in mid-September. Therefore, Q4 guidance is arguably the most important operating forecast that management provides to investors to gauge how the business and its product cycles will fare.\n\nThe company's strong guidance today suggests that multiple new hardware devices are coming in the fall (up to three new iPhone models). Per Tim Cook, \"we are very excited about the products and services in our pipeline.\"\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\nOverall, our thesis has become even stronger on Apple. Similar to Warren Buffett's investment case, we believe Apple is truly a consumer brand at heart (vs. a classic technology or hardware company). Steady-growing consumer brands not only warrant higher prices and profits over time, but they tend to command higher public market valuations (given the predictability and secular growth of their earnings) than the hardware companies (which tend to be more cyclical, harder to predict and more susceptible to commoditization/price erosion from competition).

Similar to Warren Buffett's investment case, we believe Apple is truly a consumer brand at heart (vs. a classic technology or hardware company).

At only 14x P/E on Wall Street's 2019 earnings estimates, AAPL is still too cheap for a growing consumer brand with pricing power and network effects.", "parent_text": "Our takeaway on AAPL Q3 results / outlook Apple posted strong fiscal Q3 results Tuesday, demonstrating the continued pricing power of the iPhone and the stickiness of the company's software & services ecosystem. At the after-hours price on Tuesday, it reached $995 billion in market cap and could shortly become the world's first $1 trillion public company.\n\nThe company grew its quarterly revenue and EPS by +17% and +40% year-over-year, in line with Wall Street estimates. Next quarter's guidance was also above estimates.\n\nMore important for Apple's future business and financial prospects is the complexion of that performance. Let's dive into how this quarter and management's guidance reflect Apple's two most fundamental moats: brand equity and network effects.\n\n**First, on the hardware front:**\n\nMany were hanging high hopes on Apple's flagship handset (the iPhone, which is 60% of Apple's revenue) and its climbing ASP. This quarter, the company delivered. The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during Q3 is basically flat from last year, but the average selling price of $724 is a notable jump. This bump is likely due to an increasing mix of the pricier iPhone X, which starts at $999.\n\nOur main takeaway from this robust pricing growth is that Apple continues to improve its brand equity and expand its pricing power. In a world of ever-increasing selection of lower-priced Android phones and already-high Apple penetration, Apple is undoubtedly seeing its iPhone unit sales growth slow. But the company is building digital services and a suite of other gadgets around the device. Those newer businesses, along with higher price iPhones, are widening Apple's brand equity and supporting continued pricing power and revenue growth. And pricing power, as Buffett often puts it, is the \"holy grail\" in investing.\n\n**Next, on the software front:**\n\nInvestors have been watching closely as Apple ups its software and services revenue -- a catch-all category that includes the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud services. This segment has been outpacing iPhone revenue growth for several quarters.\n\nApple positively surprised with $9.55 billion in software and services revenue this quarter (+31% growth). We think there's still tremendous opportunity left for growth in this sticky, high-margin app/developer ecosystem. The reason (and the moat): network effects.\n\nAs Apple acquires more iPhone users from a hardware perspective, it grows the distribution channel through which app developers sell/offer their apps. This is great for developers because it widens their consumer audiences, and it's great for consumers because it widens the selection of apps, software and other services to make the smartphone experience more rich and engaging.

This is great for developers because it widens their consumer audiences, and it's great for consumers because it widens the selection of apps, software and other services to make the smartphone experience more rich and engaging.

Similar to Warren Buffett's investment case, we believe Apple is truly a consumer brand at heart (vs. a classic technology or hardware company).

First, breaking the trillion dollar wall will remove a psychological resistance.\n\nSecond, looking at their revenue and margins is really impressive. Apple has done a great job squeezing more out of a fairly saturated smartphone market. Increasing prices for loyal customers that change handsets less frequently seems to be paying off. Add to that more sales from installed base with accessories like earpods. This is a great bridge from a time where unit sales was driving revenue and profit to a future which I think is every interesting - Apple as a service company.\n\nApple is successfully (so far) shifting slowly to services. Icloud, Apple Care, Apple music is just the beginning. In the future I see Apple bundling today's services with devices and video. Why sell a phone for $1000 every two years when you can charge a monthly fee for it and what goes into it. This will put apple on top of upgrading cycles instead of the consumer. It will also help Apple further penertrate its base - customers with Mac and iPhone might want to add an Apple TV to their home for $10 a month with content.\n\nAnyway, Apple is very interesting. They have a huge installed base of devices that's just waiting to get monetized. They are truly positioned to pull this off.

At the after-hours price on Tuesday, it reached $995 billion in market cap and could shortly become the world's first $1 trillion public company.\n\nThe company grew its quarterly revenue and EPS by +17% and +40% year-over-year, in line with Wall Street estimates. Next quarter's guidance was also above estimates.\n\nMore important for Apple's future business and financial prospects is the complexion of that performance. Let's dive into how this quarter and management's guidance reflect Apple's two most fundamental moats: brand equity and network effects.\n\n**First, on the hardware front:**\n\nMany were hanging high hopes on Apple's flagship handset (the iPhone, which is 60% of Apple's revenue) and its climbing ASP. This quarter, the company delivered. The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during Q3 is basically flat from last year, but the average selling price of $724 is a notable jump. This bump is likely due to an increasing mix of the pricier iPhone X, which starts at $999.\n\nOur main takeaway from this robust pricing growth is that Apple continues to improve its brand equity and expand its pricing power. In a world of ever-increasing selection of lower-priced Android phones and already-high Apple penetration, Apple is undoubtedly seeing its iPhone unit sales growth slow. But the company is building digital services and a suite of other gadgets around the device. Those newer businesses, along with higher price iPhones, are widening Apple's brand equity and supporting continued pricing power and revenue growth. And pricing power, as Buffett often puts it, is the \"holy grail\" in investing.\n\n**Next, on the software front:**\n\nInvestors have been watching closely as Apple ups its software and services revenue -- a catch-all category that includes the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud services. This segment has been outpacing iPhone revenue growth for several quarters.\n\nApple positively surprised with $9.55 billion in software and services revenue this quarter (+31% growth).

Oh and it's a much higher margin business than iPhones too (because it costs almost nothing to plug a new developer into the App Store ecosystem, vs. the hardware that goes into an iPhone).\n\n**Finally, on the forward-looking guidance:**\n\nApple expects Q3 revenue to come between $60-62 billion (+23% growth), edging out Wall Street predictions of $59.5 billion.\n\nRecall that the company's recent quarterly results have been weighed down by concerns that it has saturated the smartphone market, marking the end of the iPhone \"supercycle.\" The next quarter (fiscal Q4) is when Apple typically introduces new iPhone models -- usually in mid-September. Therefore, Q4 guidance is arguably the most important operating forecast that management provides to investors to gauge how the business and its product cycles will fare.\n\nThe company's strong guidance today suggests that multiple new hardware devices are coming in the fall (up to three new iPhone models).

Similar to Warren Buffett's investment case, we believe Apple is truly a consumer brand at heart (vs. a classic technology or hardware company). Steady-growing consumer brands not only warrant higher prices and profits over time, but they tend to command higher public market valuations (given the predictability and secular growth of their earnings) than the hardware companies (which tend to be more cyclical, harder to predict and more susceptible to commoditization/price erosion from competition).

Next quarter's guidance was also above estimates.\n\nMore important for Apple's future business and financial prospects is the complexion of that performance. Let's dive into how this quarter and management's guidance reflect Apple's two most fundamental moats: brand equity and network effects.\n\n**First, on the hardware front:**\n\nMany were hanging high hopes on Apple's flagship handset (the iPhone, which is 60% of Apple's revenue) and its climbing ASP. This quarter, the company delivered. The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during Q3 is basically flat from last year, but the average selling price of $724 is a notable jump. This bump is likely due to an increasing mix of the pricier iPhone X, which starts at $999.\n\nOur main takeaway from this robust pricing growth is that Apple continues to improve its brand equity and expand its pricing power. In a world of ever-increasing selection of lower-priced Android phones and already-high Apple penetration, Apple is undoubtedly seeing its iPhone unit sales growth slow. But the company is building digital services and a suite of other gadgets around the device. Those newer businesses, along with higher price iPhones, are widening Apple's brand equity and supporting continued pricing power and revenue growth. And pricing power, as Buffett often puts it, is the \"holy grail\" in investing.\n\n**Next, on the software front:**\n\nInvestors have been watching closely as Apple ups its software and services revenue -- a catch-all category that includes the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Pay, iTunes, and iCloud services. This segment has been outpacing iPhone revenue growth for several quarters.\n\nApple positively surprised with $9.55 billion in software and services revenue this quarter (+31% growth). We think there's still tremendous opportunity left for growth in this sticky, high-margin app/developer ecosystem. The reason (and the moat): network effects.\n\nAs Apple acquires more iPhone users from a hardware perspective, it grows the distribution channel through which app developers sell/offer their apps. This is great for developers because it widens their consumer audiences, and it's great for consumers because it widens the selection of apps, software and other services to make the smartphone experience more rich and engaging.

Their strength is delivery. \n\nSome say they could quickly dethrone Starbucks, which has basically enjoyed little competition in China.  I have my doubts.

Even though it hasn't done *that* much since, here are some factors that make me wanna go long, and I wanted some feedback if these were legitimate reasons to stick with Disney:\n\n* Star Wars land is gonna be a thing at both American parks, and there's the Toy Story park opening up, too. In addition, I recall reading that the parks represent a much larger portion of Disney's market cap as opposed to the net profit of their movies. In fact, I think only media acquisitions make more money than the parks, which leads us to...\n\n* The Fox deal. I think it just went through, which is why there was a notable increase in Disney's value last week. This could mean a lot of things - time will tell what exactly that'll be, however. \n\n* I also read that Bob Iger is gonna be succeeded by a new CEO within the next few years. Depending on this new director's philosophy, things could get very interesting indeed here. Personally, I think he's been playing things too safe. I want the next CEO to be someone a bit more like Eisner - someone more willing to experiment and embrace Disney's message of using your imagination. It seems a bit contradictory to run a company that touts the virtues of being imaginative and innovative in a way that is seemingly antithetical to that, sometimes. \n\n* I want to see what's going to happen with LucasFilm. I think it needs a drastic re-structuring, IMO. For example, not giving the Star Wars videogame license to a single publisher, even if it was my personal favorite publisher. It should be more on a leasing basis. As an aside, I think Disney overall (LucasFilm and otherwise) has missed too many potential opportunities working the current popularity of videogames for my personal comfort, both as a gamer and an investor. I can only describe them as being \"out of touch\" in regards to videogames this past decade. Hehe, maybe I'll attend next year's Disney investor summit and put some things in peoples' ears.\n\nEDIT: I liked some parts of the Disney Star Wars era thus far, but I also wanted to add that Star Wars shouldn't be controversial. These new movies should be objective improvements in every aspect to the prequels. The people that are berating fans on Twitter need to be kept on *much* shorter leashes. People shouldn't be comparing these new movies to the prequels. Maybe they should pace them a bit, and not worry too much about getting one out every year. I know it's comparing apples to dragonfruit, but Nintendo crown jewel Shigeru Miyamoto once said that a delayed game can eventually become good, and a bad game that gets released is bad forever, and I think something similar can apply to a film franchise.
