You can use it for one store front, or multiple, just on that store or also selling on marketplaces (etsy, amazon), platforms (FB, Instam, Pinterest), in games, in CTV apps, VR. Shopify is building an 'OS' for merchants which is API driven .. thats how all those other non-storefront channels are supported, via APIs.\n\nI like Square too, but sold some and took profits.

They have extensive manufacturing capability in China as part of their partnerships which shields them from the current trade disputes.  \n\nThe entire automotive industry is in for a shakeup if not from another recession, then from changes in consumer habits and technology.

If you get in when they are raising the dividend, you will have missed the boat.  Can they go lower?  Yes, I believe so, especially as we get deeper into the trade wars as tariffs will affect their bottom line or if we head into another recession.  But are you investing for the next 2 years?  Or the next 20 years?  Are you trying to time the market?  If you buy now and it drops due to recession or the effects of the tariffs, *buy more*.  GM is right to do financial and operational housekeeping; I would not look at that as a sign of weakness but as a sign of addressing their core issues.  It's like saying you wouldn't date the cute, plus size girl in the gym.  No, I wouldn't date the plus size girl **not** in the gym.  Go check out /r/progresspics.\n\nIf you are investing for the next 20 years, it's hard to imagine any other US manufacturer coming out on top of GM in that window.  Ford is very far behind with autonomous vehicles and technology in general; they have all but admitted they cannot build a superior product and can rely solely on higher margin product (SUVs, pickups).  Tesla still has a lot to prove in terms of manufacturing capabilities, profitability, and products which compete on more than just the fancies of liberals in CA.  The Model 3 still has not really delivered on the promise of a mass market electric sedan and Elon Musk is having a public breakdown while promising a $25,000 vehicle in 3 years.\n\nThe consumer demand for transportation will change and how it is delivered will change in the next 5, 10, 20 years.

They have extensive manufacturing capability in China as part of their partnerships which shields them from the current trade disputes.  \n\nThe entire automotive industry is in for a shakeup if not from another recession, then from changes in consumer habits and technology.  Of the US manufacturers, it's hard to argue that GM is in the best position given Ford's recent capitulation in the sedan segment and FCA/Chrysler's milquetoast performance overall outside of Jeep.\n\n/u/Saucepass87 : \n\n> They are slashing their dividend, cutting costs, wages...\n\nThese are all signs that they are righting the ship.  If you get in when they are raising the dividend, you will have missed the boat.  Can they go lower?  Yes, I believe so, especially as we get deeper into the trade wars as tariffs will affect their bottom line or if we head into another recession.  But are you investing for the next 2 years?  Or the next 20 years?  Are you trying to time the market?  If you buy now and it drops due to recession or the effects of the tariffs, *buy more*.  GM is right to do financial and operational housekeeping; I would not look at that as a sign of weakness but as a sign of addressing their core issues.  It's like saying you wouldn't date the cute, plus size girl in the gym.  No, I wouldn't date the plus size girl **not** in the gym.  Go check out /r/progresspics.\n\nIf you are investing for the next 20 years, it's hard to imagine any other US manufacturer coming out on top of GM in that window.  Ford is very far behind with autonomous vehicles and technology in general; they have all but admitted they cannot build a superior product and can rely solely on higher margin product (SUVs, pickups).  Tesla still has a lot to prove in terms of manufacturing capabilities, profitability, and products which compete on more than just the fancies of liberals in CA.  The Model 3 still has not really delivered on the promise of a mass market electric sedan and Elon Musk is having a public breakdown while promising a $25,000 vehicle in 3 years.\n\nThe consumer demand for transportation will change and how it is delivered will change in the next 5, 10, 20 years.
