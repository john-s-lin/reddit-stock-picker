Please keep in mind that most of my answer was part of the official press release.   \n\n\n**Who is behind this company:** \n\nBehind 'Orascom Development Holding' is Egyptian business man and billionaire Samih Sawiris. His business model is pretty unique. Basically, what he does is he buys land (usually millions of square meters) at a remote location, f.e. in the desert. The government sells it to him for usually a symbolic 1$ per sqm and get in return a fully functional and integrated town. So ODH starts building: Hotels, Marina, Golf courts, Appartements, Villas, Shops, even Schools, Hospitals and Universities.   \n\n\nWhat once was en empty (worthless) piece of land will be very valuable after some years. The cashflow from operation is re-invested into the town to build and develop more attractive destinations. More real estate sales and more tourists means --> more attractive destination --> Price per sqm goes up --> more profit --> more cash to build --> more attractive destination --> more infrastructure and more development --> Price per sqm goes up --> ....   \n\n\nAlthough he can't collect taxes he is free to collet fees. He controls everything inside this destination, from water suppliers to garbage collectors to shops, retail stores and restaurants. And everyone pays fees.   \n\n\nSo basically ODH earns from:   \n\\- Hotels  \n\\- Real Estate  \n\\- Town Management   \n\\- Land Sales (they try not to sell)   \n\n\nHistorically most destinations and therefore most revenue and profit came from Egypt, however, in the last decade ODH started to diversify their portfolio of destination. Because of the business model, this takes a very long time, maybe up to 10 years until a destination is profitable. In the first years, infrastructure has to be build, therefore it is impossible to earn money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What went wrong:** \n\n  \nBut right after the IPO in year 2008 ODH came under heavy pressure. First was the financial crises (basically a real estate crises). After that came the Arab spring, just as tourism recovered some years later there was the second revolution in Egypt. Tourism has dried out and the town El Gouna, which was a huge cash cow at that time, could not send the profits to the other destinations (Oman, Montenegro, Switzerland, UK,...) anymore. But those destinations were in a rump up phase and didn't earn much money.   \n\n\nSo with a dead (or heavy hit) cash cow and many destinations in the ramp up phase the company even needed to sell some land just to stay in business. However, tourism recovered in the years after the second revolution and just as they started to report some profitable quarters again, and just as the other destinations outside of Egypt started to mature, a Russian airplane got shot down on the Sinai Peninsula, pretty close to the Taba Destination which Orascom operated. Most countries announced travel bans. What followed was an even bigger tourism crises.   \n\n\n**What went even wronger:** \n\nSome years passed, with huge debts on the balance sheet, the Egyptian National Bank unpegged the EGP from USD, which was another blow to ODH. However, at least thanks to cheap prices, tourism started to recover. And so did the stock ODHN. That was about 3-4 years ago, and with a new management, now the other destinations have matured a lot. Now everything they have build in the last couple of years could bear fruits in the next couple of years. The Egyptian exposure is still big but will go down within the next years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market cap of this company is only 660m USD:**   \n\n\nConsidering, if we believe CBRE, alone land and hotels in the town of El Gouna are worth 4x the current market cap. They have about 13 other destinations. Some of them are pretty mature already. On top of that comes everything else in El Gouna (which is a town full of infrastructure and some 22'000 people living there all year round). On top of that comes also the Swiss destination which they soon own 51% of which would add another 110m to the current market cap.   \n\n\n**Mind the risk:** \n\nWhile this sounds all very promising and market cap could easily be in the billions, please don't forget that even though they have unprecedented hidden value, ODH is still not profitable. And a terrorist attack can happen at any time, also the situation in Egypt might be fragile. If the situation remains like this and if tourism in Egypt keeps growing there is huge upside potential.    \n\n\nIf somebody is here that could also do some research I would be very happy. I would also be interested if somebody could look at their balance sheet a bit closer.   \n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 0.5, "submission_title": "Most undervalued stock right now", "submission_text": "I think every once in a while especially with the volatile markets right now it\u2018s interesting to have a little discussion on which stocks are the most undervalued so here you go, tell me which stock do you think is the most undervalued!", "parent_text": "That is one of the best comments here, well structured and with an answer thousand times better than those one word answers.\nWould you tell me what the reason for people selling was?

Besides China all the other big markets (USA, Japan, Europe) have all show strong iPhone revenue growth the last 3 years.\n\n2. FALSE. That is your opinion. The very fact that the iPhone is by far the best selling smartphone in the world the last 7 years makes that opinion look foolish.\n\n3. FALSE. Services revenue is dependent on active USER BASE not quarterly or annual sales. Services revenue will grow as long as user base grows. User base grew by 100,000,000 last year even with declining unit sales.\n\n4. FALSE.  Airpods, Watch, and biometric security is some of the biggest innovations in tech the last 5 years. Most agree that wearables is the next big thing. And Apple is absolutely dominating the wearable market.\n\n5. FALSE.  Several of Apples other products could be their own Fortune100 companies.  Services will be a $50 billion company this year. Wearables is growing extremely fast and will be at $40 billion very soon.\n\n6. FALSE. Again iPhone is by far the best SELLING and MOST EXPENSIVE phone on the planet. People with money are paying for Apple innovation.\n\n7. FALSE.  Just give a couple years. All the big android companies will copy Apple.\n\n8. FALSE. Google charges the same 30%. If it was so unreasonable then a viable alternative with a lower commission rate would show up. None have.\n\n9. FALSE.  Again USER BASE is more important then quarterly unit sales. Apple only has 15% of the entire market. They can easily pull levers to increase their market share.\n\n10. FALSE. Again the iPhone is best selling phone in the world.

With NFLX you can get an enormous amount of scale from the business.  For the most part, new subscriptions are kind of icing on the cake.  So things like SG&A expenses are not going to be linear to subscriber growth.  In fact, it wouldn't necessarily have to grow at all (although I'm sure it is growing some each year with NFLX, maybe even considerably in the near term but that should level off).  So expenses like payrol, HR, accounts pay/rec, headquarters occupancy expense et al, none of those departments would need to expand in anyway for \"one more subscription\".  Think of it like the last dollar spent at a Wal-Mart.  You get a lot of leverage on the sales at the back end as all of the fixed expenses are covered.   \n\nAlso they spend a ton of money on content and their own original content.  I'm no NFLX expert, so I don't know exactly how those streaming agreements work.  But for their original content it is pretty simple.  Additional subscribers are just going to allow for amortization of the original content expense over more accounts.  And there is just some level of \"good ideas\" limit per year.  I don't know what the number is, but lets just say 12B of content spending per year is kind of the upper limit of \"good ideas\".  Maybe even say 15B ( I think currently they are at about 9B).    \n\nSo now look at 5 years out and say subs have gone from 150m to 300m with 6% average yearly price increases (use $10 for year 1). So after 5 years you have 300m subs @ $13.38/month x 12 months.  So now you are looking at top line revenue ~48B compared to about 15B this year.  And remember a lot of those expenses aren't going to increase at the pace of revenue.    \n\nThese are all hypothetical numbers.  And again, I am no NFLX expert and am not long or short the name.  My only point in the original comment above is you can't just look at NFLX (or AMZN for example) and see a high PE ratio and think it is automatically wildly expensive.  It could be expensive, and if the subscriber story with NFLX doesn't work out it will be proven to be expensive, but the point is there is just way more to the argument than headline PE.  \n\nI hope this is helpful.

But I'll try to piece it together.\n\n*I am bullish on Netflix and Amazon and bearish on FB and Apple.*\n\nSure. That's fine. I'm actually bearish on Netflix as Disney will be more of a player than most people think. But let's carry on.\n\n*First three are not trade war stock still they are not fully immune.*\n\n???\n\nRegardless of what happens, in a trade war, pretty much all stocks suffer. A trade war affects raw materials and labor. It's a ripple effect all around. I'm not disagreeing with your statement. I just feel it has no weight. Trade wars benefit no one. The irony is that in the last trade war talks, earlier this year, Apple was a haven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Important thing to look next week is the meeting netween US and China. If meeting goes good (less chance) buy long call DTE march 1 for amazon and Netflix. If meeting goes bad buy more apple put Feb 15 DTE*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWon't comment on the idea itself but I think your dates are a bit incorrect. First off, Apple has its earnings report on February 7th, 2019. So you're gambling on the fact that Apple will report a terrible quarter and will continue to drop past February 15th. Apple has already announced that their numbers are taking a hit so investors have the expectation that the stock will drop.  The negativity is already priced in. So with a 'put' on the dates you've listed, you're expecting an even larger drop but even with all of the issues facing Apple, it won't go as low as you think. You're discounting the Cook-effect, where when the window opens, Apple buys back its shares. And Buffett \\*will\\* buy more when he sees a nice price. Also if there is even a semblance of surprise with the sales of the Iphone, the stock will move upwards. I'm not disagreeing that Apple's stock still has room to drop but I'm disagreeing with you on your puts on those dates, especially after an earnings report. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Other Important points: Border wall shutdown: No solution within next week. When it is solved stock will temporarily go up*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is irrelevant to stocks right now. And basing a stock strategy on this is foolhardy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*China trade war and slowing economy: Most probably will not change until trump gone.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisagree here. I'm not a Trump supporter but even I can state that Trump knows that it isn't the best interest of his term or the structure of the economy to continue with the trade war. His strategy is he hopes to negotiate with China, to get something better than our current terms with China, and until he gets what he wants, he'll continue the trade war. But one of two things will happen.  First, a deal actually happens. And should that happen, the trade war will end. Or second, a point comes in where the trade war ends as all trade wars have ended in the past, the realization that you cannot do this with China. Bush failed with this in 2002 with a steel tarrif. Obama failed as well. For a history lesson on this, you can view this article here:\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)\n\nThe summation?  A trade war doesn't last forever. It either comes to a deal (best case situation) or it comes to a cease-fire where one realizes you really can't f with China.\n\n*Trumps position is weakening and china will exploit that to buy time.*\n\nChina doesn't have time. This is actually why I fully disagree entirely with your statement prior in your belief that the trade war will continue for the entire term of Trump's presidency.\n\n*(+) Feds became dovish (+)*\n\nNot much weight here. They were dovish one day before you posted. So it's just facts prior to what you wrote.\n\n*Within next 3 months general stocks remain same or move up. Don't go down much.*\n\nDisagree here. If we get a negative response in this upcoming meeting with China, this could turn very ugly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Possible things on the table: Trump impeachment: New government will be stable and china trade war will stop. That is positive. If trump is impeached (he will not be) than it will be problem as violence and unrest may result. If he lost 2020 election (which he will) it is good for stock market in a long run*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIrrelevant and a poor strategy in stocks. Yes, there is the possibility that he may face impeachment but basing a stock strategy around a hypothesis of this nature is ill-advised.

The irony is that in the last trade war talks, earlier this year, Apple was a haven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Important thing to look next week is the meeting netween US and China. If meeting goes good (less chance) buy long call DTE march 1 for amazon and Netflix. If meeting goes bad buy more apple put Feb 15 DTE*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWon't comment on the idea itself but I think your dates are a bit incorrect. First off, Apple has its earnings report on February 7th, 2019. So you're gambling on the fact that Apple will report a terrible quarter and will continue to drop past February 15th. Apple has already announced that their numbers are taking a hit so investors have the expectation that the stock will drop.  The negativity is already priced in. So with a 'put' on the dates you've listed, you're expecting an even larger drop but even with all of the issues facing Apple, it won't go as low as you think. You're discounting the Cook-effect, where when the window opens, Apple buys back its shares. And Buffett \\*will\\* buy more when he sees a nice price. Also if there is even a semblance of surprise with the sales of the Iphone, the stock will move upwards. I'm not disagreeing that Apple's stock still has room to drop but I'm disagreeing with you on your puts on those dates, especially after an earnings report. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Other Important points: Border wall shutdown: No solution within next week. When it is solved stock will temporarily go up*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is irrelevant to stocks right now. And basing a stock strategy on this is foolhardy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*China trade war and slowing economy: Most probably will not change until trump gone.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisagree here. I'm not a Trump supporter but even I can state that Trump knows that it isn't the best interest of his term or the structure of the economy to continue with the trade war. His strategy is he hopes to negotiate with China, to get something better than our current terms with China, and until he gets what he wants, he'll continue the trade war. But one of two things will happen.  First, a deal actually happens. And should that happen, the trade war will end. Or second, a point comes in where the trade war ends as all trade wars have ended in the past, the realization that you cannot do this with China. Bush failed with this in 2002 with a steel tarrif. Obama failed as well. For a history lesson on this, you can view this article here:\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)\n\nThe summation?  A trade war doesn't last forever. It either comes to a deal (best case situation) or it comes to a cease-fire where one realizes you really can't f with China.\n\n*Trumps position is weakening and china will exploit that to buy time.*\n\nChina doesn't have time. This is actually why I fully disagree entirely with your statement prior in your belief that the trade war will continue for the entire term of Trump's presidency.\n\n*(+) Feds became dovish (+)*\n\nNot much weight here. They were dovish one day before you posted. So it's just facts prior to what you wrote.\n\n*Within next 3 months general stocks remain same or move up. Don't go down much.*\n\nDisagree here. If we get a negative response in this upcoming meeting with China, this could turn very ugly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Possible things on the table: Trump impeachment: New government will be stable and china trade war will stop. That is positive. If trump is impeached (he will not be) than it will be problem as violence and unrest may result. If he lost 2020 election (which he will) it is good for stock market in a long run*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIrrelevant and a poor strategy in stocks. Yes, there is the possibility that he may face impeachment but basing a stock strategy around a hypothesis of this nature is ill-advised. This is a poor, overarching method to stocks...potentially even dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Current turbulent state will run through 2020*\n\nYou are somehow predicting the next 2 years of stocks? ...", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1546737256.0, "submission_id": "acpxvz", "comment_id": "edcfla3", "body": "What other stock doing bad like GE?
