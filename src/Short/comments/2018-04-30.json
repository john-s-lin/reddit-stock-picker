I think both can and are true but some stocks have more fundamental investors whereas others attract more technical investors. Micron is a fundamentally good company but it is also a tech stock, and a volatile one at that so it attracts technical traders, I believe that technical trading, at least to a certain degree, is a self fulfilling prophesy, meaning that so many investors believe in it, that their investing strategies affect the very behavior of the stocks they are trying to predict. Also, by definition the overall market general affects individual stocks, and the market has recently been in correction. Just my amateur opinion, but if you are investing for long term and fundamentals, you might consider weathering this downturn.
