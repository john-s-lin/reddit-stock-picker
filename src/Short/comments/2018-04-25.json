But don't go out of your way to try to be a knife catcher, until you have more confidence in your ability to analyze and judge value. \n\nI'm very much a \"knife-catcher\" myself. But to do it successfully, you really have to be a value investor. It helps to have some skills with financial statement analysis, reading reports, and understanding fundamentals, in addition to knowing enough technical analysis to recognize a likely bottom. It also helps to understand that many industries are very cyclical; they go through booms and busts. If you follow those industries, and are very patient, you can find values. \n\nNvidia happens to be in one of those highly volitaile industries with somewhat predictible cycles. There are times when supply is tight and demand is high, and prices soar. There are times when there's too much supply, and margins fall, and stock prices drop precipitously. \n\nBut where we are currently in that cycle, is we are at a point where Nvidia has a valuation which is absolutely insane, and impossible to justify on any fundamental basis. No self respecting value investor would touch it. Paying 14 x sales, and 45x current years earnings, for that company is crazy. I wouldn't pay more than $30 for Nvidia (2x sales, 7x trailing earnings) right now.  \n\nNvidia has simply gotten lucky and had an unusually strong bullish cycle. No one a few years back anticipated the surge in demand for GPUs which would be caused by the cryptocurrency boom, and that was followed by a strong cycle for new gaming platforms like Ninetendo Switch. \n\nBut the peak of this cycle has likely alread occurred. The crypto bubble has already begun to burst, and new gaming hardware platforms typically come out only about once every 5 years. The fundamentals here aren't that complicated.  \n\nOn top of which, it appears it has already begun to break down techinically. You have a triple top at around 250 over the last few months, and it now looks in danger of breaking its lower trendline. \n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 0.5, "submission_title": "Catching falling knives", "submission_text": "I understand - and have heard many times on this sub - that its a general rule to understand when you have a loss to cut and not to keep buying on decline... but doesnt this apply more towards day trading or short term investments?

He started the MVIS Reddit forum and attempted to recruit the yahoo users onto his board, this was back about 2013 or so. He was unable to accomplish this task, but continued to try his best to recruit users, only ever managing to gather his pump and dump circle of thieve friends onto his latest forum. Eventually, Yahoo board made changes to their format and these changes made it more appealing for the users to switch to the controlled Reddit board, thus his recruiting efforts began to pay off. Once Yahoo message board was finally shut down, the MVIS Reddit board really began to flourish. \n\nThe entire goal from the getgo was to  create a board where the flow of information could be controlled by the mods in an attempt to pump the stock when they so see fit and dog the stock when they see fit, follow the money as they say.\n\nThe end result is a message board that is controlled by a ring of con men that number around a dozen or so. They make  90 percent of all posts and they control what is allowed and what is not, when they see fit. All the earmarks of a pump and dump scam message board. When anyone questions this, they ban them. New posters are quickly insulted and suspected of trolling their board. A dozen or so control the over 800 members. They control what is allowed, they control what is said to be their history, which is a total fabrication made up of half truths and lies together with timeline distortions.\n\nHere is an example of the latest poster that posted information that was not first ran past the mods :\n\n\" \\[\u2013\\][**mugsymealine**](https://old.reddit.com/user/mugsymealine) **\\-1 points** 18 minutes ago \n\nHenry James is not going I just talked to him.

Nothing sketchy about that, right?\n\nDid you post this on the thread you intended?\"\n\nNotice the down voted Karma rating, that is just one more tactic they use to control the flow of information on this forum. Henry James is a manager of State of Michigan investments which include MicroVision at present, so this info was spot on relevant to the discussion of MVIS, that Henry James was not going to attend the Annual Share Holder meeting that is coming up for this company.\n\nThe mods of this forum have very recently used a statement of an MVIS engineer \\(Kevin Watson\\) in a twisted attempt to pump the stock. The day that they did this, the stock had a 5X increase in volume and a 10X increase in share price. When confronted with this, the response of the mod, geo\\_rule, was to ban my account.\n\nBottom line, **MVIS REDDIT FORUM IS A PUMP AND DUMP** that should be added to the pump and dump list for Reddit\n\nI'm sorry for the long read and if this is posted on the wrong forum.
