If July oil futures are much higher than the spot price in the market that means that the market believes the price is going to rise from the current price by July when the future is exercised. Obviously the future price can be effected by the spot price- if oil spikes several dollars futures down the line will probably rise too because it increases the likelihood that oil will be more expensive in the future. But that\u2019s not always the case if the catalyst for the spike is believed to be short-lived. Look at vix futures where Jan vix futures are much higher than March and the spread is very narrow there after. What that tells you is that the futures market doesn\u2019t believe the Vix is going to stay at 25 for months. If something changes, ie a terrorist attack occurs and the Vix spikes to 50, that changes the landscape and the March futures will jump.

GILD is entering, PFE making big investments, AZN, Eli, and JNJ all share this space. Nobody currently dominates it....yet! I would say though that with Juno and bluebird - CELG is on the verge of dominating the CAR-T space - which has proven to be fantastic for blood borne malignancies but just \u201cmeh\u201d for solid tunors. So there is a lot of room left to grow and you have to remember that the humane genome project was just completed in 2000, so all of this is very new but very fast growing. Steve Jobs said it himself - the next biggest breakthrough will come from the biotech sector and I think we are on the verge of seeing that.\n\nOverall, this may be a really good thing for the public. I think major pharma companies are giving up on their drugs that affect 95% of Americans and now focusing on specialty products. That means that these big pharma companies are easing up on lobbying and agreeing to let generic drug makers into the space. The problem remains to lie in health insurance companies. Mega mergers on that side are completely fucking the sector right in the ass. Look at United Healthcare stock from the last 10 years, and compare it to BMY and CELG....now tell me which side of the field is hurting and which side is thriving. Insurance companies are taking in the dough, and I personally think that for-profit insurance is a disservice to the public. In no shape or form does insurance engage in innovation. Whereas Biotech and Pharma are the ones innovating and saving lives. Literally! Bluebird bio about to cure fucking B-thalassemia! So why should the pharma and biotech companies be punished?

One is an investment on economic growth, the other is a hedge against economic turmoil, whether it be financial crisis, inflation, or political issues. Gold is better compare to currencies because they share a common purpose: storing buying power.\n\nA lot of Bogleheads will give you the spiel about \"non-productive asset\" because they heard Buffet talk about it that one time, but it's not meant to be a productive asset. A house is a non-productive asset if you live in it, but no one would argue against buying a house if you need a place to live and can afford it. On the other hand, if your goal is to grow a given amount of investment, a long-term holding of gold should never be the investment of choice.\n\nThat being said, GLD (the ETF) doesn't follow the mission statement of gold (the metal). GLD is best used as a tool to trade the price of gold, but again, not a long-term investment. If the goal is to store wealth or hedge against some kind of systemic instability, owning GLD makes little sense since the ETF is part of the financial system as a whole. If you want to hedge against the system, you wouldn't do it from within the system.\n\nYou have to consider the purpose of different investments and consider likes with likes as best you can, and I don't think you can make a good case for comparing GLD, gold, and S&P. In terms of absolute returns, S&P should beat gold in the long term. If it didn't, people would buy gold rather than start businesses and then we'd just all be sitting here with one hand on our dicks and the other on our pile of gold. Why go through the trouble of owning and managing a restaurant when you can just buy a bar of gold and make more money?\n\nEdit: Invariably, someone will mention that it's not even worth hedging against systemic risk because if and when the risk comes to pass, you probably won't be able to do much with gold anyway, so let me address that. The world isn't black and white, and a \"systemic risk\" is a spectrum. The housing collapse was a systemic risk, but it didn't lead to the apocalypse, and you didn't need gold to weather it.\n\nHyperinflation in the various emerging/developing countries over the past few years is a systemic risk to the residents of those countries, and a lot of them would have done well to hold some metal if they were able to afford it before their respective crises occurred. Most of this sub is the US, I imagine, where something like that seems like an insignificant risk to hedge, but the 1970s would beg to differ.\n\nRay Dalio's recent article on LinkedIn (can't link, sub blacklists LinkedIn domain) goes into some detail about how power struggles inevitably arise when an up-and-coming economy becomes powerful enough to challenge the premier world power at a given time, and I'd argue that this is a possibility with the US and China, their debt situation notwithstanding. I'm not saying it will or won't happen because I obviously don't know, but if you assume it's a possibility, this would be a \"systemic risk\" where holding gold might make some sense because you introduce some doubt into how global currencies would weather the period.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 24, "submission_ratio": 0.08333333333333333, "submission_title": "Gld outperforms snp and Dow", "submission_text": "Gld has outperformed the snp and Dow since 2005. why does gold have such a bad rap as an investment?", "parent_text": "Gld outperforms snp and Dow Gld has outperformed the snp and Dow since 2005. why does gold have such a bad rap as an investment?", "parent_score": 24, "parent_ratio": 0.08333333333333333}, {"time": 1546790611.0, "submission_id": "ac5ibv", "comment_id": "ede2rm7", "body": "Inevitably, one day, the USD will not be the World\u2019s Reserve Currency and gold will shine again with no help from governments.\n\nGold miners are underpriced.
