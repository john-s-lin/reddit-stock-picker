But still struggle to see how this becomes profitable for them.\n\nSay a movie costs $12 each, and I go 10 times a month- that's $120-10 or $110 moviepass is losing.\n\nTheir goal is to get theatres to discount tickets to them to stay competitive with other theatres, and also because average user spends $6 more per visit in concessions. Let's say theatres discount down to $6/ticket. At 10 visits, Moviepass still loses $50/month on my visit, while the theatre basically breaks even at $6/ticket plus $6/concessions, though gets more users in the door and profits more.\n\nAt $10 a month for moviepass and 10 movie visits a month, they'd need to get the price per ticket down to $1/ticket.\n\nIf the average user only goes once a week, 4 times a month, they still need tickets to go down to $2.5. I can't see theatres discounting this drastically for an uptick in visitors and concession visits. I'm not sure the average theatre goer rate or profit, but if the average person goes once a month, and moviepass increases it to 4x/month, at $2.5 ticket cost to moviepass, the theatre would need a heck of a high profit margin on the $6 in concessions to break even on the extra $24 in concessions per month and loss of $40 on ticket sales.\n\nThis, plus limited space in most theatres (similar to an airline selling tickets at the perfect supply/demand point to fill planes and not have too much additional demand) leads me to believe there's no way theatres are going to drop rates that much for Moviepass unless they're having significant difficulty filling seats.\n\nLove the idea as a customer, but can't see it being profitable before they run out of cash.", "score": 21, "num_replies": 4, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 87, "submission_ratio": 0.2413793103448276, "submission_title": "I got shares of $HMNY at $13, now its $1.58 and i'm down 88%!

It's model is to literally lose money and then leverage their customer base against the leaders of a legacy industry in the hope they can have mutually beneficial relationship. Moviepass says, \"look we increased ticket sales and foot traffic to your theaters by over 30% (or whatever), now cut us in for x% of your booming additional revenue\". Since day one the legacy companies have said, \"go fuck yourself.\" And they are happy to wait it out. So unless they see the light, this whole thing is a ridiculous gamble to bet on. It is high risk, medium reward for investors at this stage. HMNY the parent company's real business is more or less a data collecting/selling. They do not have deep enough pockets to run this experiment endlessly, and they have actual other services they actually concentrate on. So the time to invest in HMNY is the day before AMC, Regal, and/or Cinemark sign a deal with Moviepass to do some sort of revenue sharing.

It's model is to literally lose money and then leverage their customer base against the leaders of a legacy industry in the hope they can have mutually beneficial relationship. Moviepass says, \"look we increased ticket sales and foot traffic to your theaters by over 30% (or whatever), now cut us in for x% of your booming additional revenue\". Since day one the legacy companies have said, \"go fuck yourself.\" And they are happy to wait it out. So unless they see the light, this whole thing is a ridiculous gamble to bet on. It is high risk, medium reward for investors at this stage. HMNY the parent company's real business is more or less a data collecting/selling. They do not have deep enough pockets to run this experiment endlessly, and they have actual other services they actually concentrate on.

If Disney expects to sell a movie tkt for 15$ and then get 80-90% cut of it in the first week (which it does currently). Why would Disney be ok with the theater selling a movie tkt for 6$ to moviepass and then passing only 90% of 6$ to DIsney. Currently and probably historically theater owners make very less money on movie tkt sales during the first 2-3 weeks of movie. The % revenue distribution only comes down after 2 -3 weeks. Movie theater owners try to make actual money on popcorn and soda. \n\nI think moviepass needs to not only have theater owners but also movie producers in the deal. Its like spotify with all music producers owning interest in spotify before IPO and only then did they allow for more songs to be added to spotify. \n\nBut the interesting thing is even if at all moviepass gets a deal with movie producers and theater owners but movie producers are only getting some small % of 10-15$ of whatever moviepass costs monthly, why wouldn't disney just bypass the theater and charge lik 12$ for its streaming service and show the movie on there?\n\nIMO, moviepass has very less chances of surviving. They would need to make deals all across the movie industry for this to work not just theater chains. Even by that time its possible streaming is the way we watch movies day 1 at home and all this would be useless.

If Disney expects to sell a movie tkt for 15$ and then get 80-90% cut of it in the first week (which it does currently). Why would Disney be ok with the theater selling a movie tkt for 6$ to moviepass and then passing only 90% of 6$ to DIsney. Currently and probably historically theater owners make very less money on movie tkt sales during the first 2-3 weeks of movie. The % revenue distribution only comes down after 2 -3 weeks. Movie theater owners try to make actual money on popcorn and soda. \n\nI think moviepass needs to not only have theater owners but also movie producers in the deal. Its like spotify with all music producers owning interest in spotify before IPO and only then did they allow for more songs to be added to spotify. \n\nBut the interesting thing is even if at all moviepass gets a deal with movie producers and theater owners but movie producers are only getting some small % of 10-15$ of whatever moviepass costs monthly, why wouldn't disney just bypass the theater and charge lik 12$ for its streaming service and show the movie on there?\n\nIMO, moviepass has very less chances of surviving.

The tariffs by themselves increased base prices for solar by a smaller portion than u would think. The 30% is only on the solar panels and does not include racking or labor.

In the next few years the Investment tax credit will be phased out in tiers from the current 30% of total cost down to 10%.

There are a couple if alternatives; wind, solar, wave, geothermic and so forth. Personally I think that solar will win out, since all other forms of energy are just converted solar energy. It is readily available, it's gotten both cheaper and more effective in recent years and it'll likely continue to improve at a faster pace than many other green power sources.\n\nHowever! Correctly identifying a major structural change in the economy doesn't necessarily equate correctly identifying a sound investment. Take the airline industry as an example. Sixty years ago, any moron with his head on straight could figure out that flying as a phenomenon would grow like crazy in coming years. The opportunities were seemingly endless! And sure, a lot of airlines are generating sound profits these days. But a lot of airlines were bankrupted along the way, and most of the surviving ones suffered 50 years of hardship to get here. If you invested all of your money in an airline 50 years ago, chances are you're broke today.\n\nAlso important to recognize: even if you correctly identify a sector of the economy that will both grow and generate massive profits in coming years, correctly identifying the best company in that sector might not be a simple task. Just look at the cell phone market. In 2006, the market was growing rapidly and generating serious cashflows. While there were numerous profitable companies in the sector, Nokia looked certain to dominate the market for ages to come. In 2007 Apple unveiled the iPhone which completely disrupted the market. A few years later Apple and Samsung had divided virtually the entire market between them and the scraps were picked up by minor players like HTC. The former major players, Nokia, Ericsson, Sony, LG and so forth were unable to compete and stopped manufacturing phones altogether efter bleeding financially for a couple of years. Today, despite having less than a fifth of the market, Apple still takes home about 90% of all the profits in the market.\n\nConsidering this, invest in solar if you want to, but be careful and make sure you do your homework before investing.

About a year or two ago I did a cost analysis on just buying Solar panels.  The dollar break-even was 18 years.  That's not good and it had some favorable assumptions that I know are not right (no maintenance? Yeah right.).  A business rule of thumb is 11 or better.  And at 18 years with 'guarantees' lasting at best 25 years, you only get 7 years of profit.  The money saving portion doesn't.  You can say what you will, but if a supposedly money saving scheme doesn't save money, your customers won't save money and therefore won't return.  Case in point my sister then went to install some on her roof, and after a year she's not even sure she saved any money.  \n  \nSolar in general is just not competitive even when other forms (oil/gas) go up in price.   \n  \nHaving said that I realize you probably want to buy it anyway.  So IF you're going to buy I would offer you this:  Don't buy now.  It looks to be on the top end of a channel between $40 and $80.  Buy now and you might watch it fall to $40 or less and kick yourself.  If and when it hits $40 dollar cost average over a few weeks.   On the flip side it may never go down - so set a final entry point at somewhere over $80.  \n  \nMy 2 cents.
