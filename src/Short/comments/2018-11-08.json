If AMD is a solid company you believe will increase in size, then just hold. If you want to make a quick buck off the market then sell when you are satisfied with your gains or had enough losses. The markets are like the Wild West and the only, and I mean only, proven and pretty much foolproof way to make money from the markets is the buy and hold ETFs (like spy, qqq) long term (10yrs+) and reinvest dividends. I know what I\u2019m saying is totally anti-WSB, but I think it\u2019s true. Picking stocks is very difficult and takes a lot of research and the people who make money without that are mostly lucky. Chuck money monthly into etf, reinvest dividends and don\u2019t look at it, and you will have better average yearly returns than most people.           If you do want to be more interactive with your portfolio, try choosing a few stocks that you think will do well. That means you aren\u2019t putting all money in one stock. For example, I bought WMT, BAC, HRL a while back because I thought that semi-long term (like a few months or so) they would increase. Some will win some won\u2019t.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 0.25, "submission_title": "Worried about AMD", "submission_text": "Hi, so I am a total noob when it comes to the stock market, but I invested about $117 in AMD in August and bought 5 shares, as I thought it would be a good start.

You're not going to turn around a copy that was badly managed for nearly two decades overnight. It's going to take years.\n\n\"Is it possible for GE to plummet to where I lose everything?\"\n\nThere's always a chance a stock will go to 0. It's certainly possible that GE could go to 0. They finally got a good CEO after nearly two decades but it may be too late at this point. There's a lot wrong at GE and on top of that a pension shortfall and investigation. New CEO Larry Culp is excellent, but whether or not he has the time necessary to fix GE's problems who knows.\n\n\nThis is what I wrote to someone else's GE post this morning and I'm going to copy/paste rather than writing all this over again.\n\n1. Culp is the first capable CEO that GE has had in nearly 20 years. But when you've had mediocre/poor management for that long, it's not going to turn around overnight by any means and Culp may ultimately be too late/not have the time a turnaround of this magnitude really needs. There has to be some sort of attempt IMO to stabilize things, because if this gets further into the mid single digits and takes out the GFC crisis lows, that could snowball. Not only does the company have to contend with righting the business, but they have a major pension shortfall and an investigation to contend with.\n\n2. I think the other issue that I have that I pondered the other day is that, perhaps the market just doesn't care about the story. GE has really been in decline for nearly 2 decades now. It's only in the last couple of years that the slow decline has picked up pace significantly.  How compelling is a \"less bad\" or \"smaller\" GE? The stock was $60 in 2001, then $40 by 2007, 10 years later it was $20, now it's $9. Best case scenario you eventually get a smaller, more streamlined GE, which given the kind of time this process will probably take, is not that fantastic of a payoff. The worst case scenario is that GE is a 0 because - as I've said countless times on here in GE threads - after 16 years of Immelt's poor mangement, rot set in.\n\n3. It's not as if GE doesn't have competitors. They have run circles around the company for ages now, they have provided better returns (or FAR better) for many years and I don't see how that changes. Some may buy parts/pieces from GE eventually but that's GE selling out of a position of weakness.\n\n4. Culp had a fantastic record at Danaher (and really, like I've been saying on here since GE was in the mid 20's, why not instead of GE buy something that's actually good... like Danaher, or Heico, or Roper, or Honeywell, etc.) It's too bad it took GE so long to get a good CEO in. They should have gotten an outsider to fix the company instead of Flannery. \n\n5. You said: \"imagining the gains if it bounced back.\" I don't think GE will ever be what it once was and even talking about that, again - we're still talking about a company that has been in decline for nearly two decades. The hope here IMO is stabilization and then a smaller GE going forward (and even that will not happen overnight, nor is success assured.) Culp was a great choice, but if the rate of decline continues in the stock I just don't think there's the kind of time needed. Or GE shareholders have to hope Berkshire bails it out.\n", "score": 7, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 3.5, "submission_title": "How long to keep GE stock?", "submission_text": "How long should I hold on to GE stock?

But basically, if you're looking to park cash somewhere so that you can re-balance in 6 months back into the stock market, then you probably want to buy a CD or a US treasury that's expiring in 6 months. Your intent is to hold until maturity and collect the 1% or so risk-free earnings from that instrument - you don't necessarily care about the resale value.

Your 3.24% bonds won't be worth as much if you want to sell them, but you will still be able to collect 3.24% per year.
