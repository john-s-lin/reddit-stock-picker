Then two thoughts later,, you say there would be an exit of foreign money out of the stock market into bonds. How can both be true?\nThe FED is raising interest rates to fight inflation, if the dollar got stronger, inflation wouldn\u2019t be a thing and the fed wouldn\u2019t raise interest rates on treasury yields, keeping demand in the stock market.\n\nAlthough I do think this will cause volatility, trump only has about 2.5 more years of being president and I think our economy is strong enough to weather this, both parties are eager to get over trumps shit.
