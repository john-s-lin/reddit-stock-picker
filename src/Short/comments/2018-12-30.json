Also, sorry but I'm not going to be able to be explicit and type everything out to explain myself.\n\nSay you buy 1 share of a S&P 500 ETF like VOO or SPY. S&P 500 averages 7% per year; this figure gets thrown around a lot but I think it includes re-investing dividends which are roughly 1.9% but it doesn't matter for this explanation, just thought I'd mention it. So lets round to 5% increase with a 2% dividend every year for simplicity. \n\nI'm still trying to figure out how to share my numbers but, without reinvesting dividends, after 15 years, the stock price will have doubled ($207.91) and you will have gotten $45.32 in dividends. So when you sell the share you will have essentially doubled your money but if had just kept it in a savings account with 2% interest rate (which is pretty high) you will have roughly $124.58.\n\nPart of what Warren Buffett's ideology is dollar cost averaging, re-investing dividends, etc. over the course of your lifetime and you can retire comfortably but I think you need to think about it relatively. If you live off $500 or $1000 a month, you don't have to invest the same amount as someone who requires $5000 per month to live, it's more about a percentage of your income over a long period of time.\n\nBuffett also says he would rather buy a farm than gold because one produces more and I think that says much more about how people should think about investing.\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 112, "submission_ratio": 0.017857142857142856, "submission_title": "Buy and hold for life strategy", "submission_text": "Why would one want to invest and hold on to dividend paying stocks for life (as in never selling the stock)?

Some of them just drop in value by their dividend every time it pays. And it isn't that hard to find a stock that outperforms them. Or more accurately, you can get a total stock market fund etf or S&P etf (with dividend reinvestment) that will reliably outperform most dividend stocks.

Yes capital gains are taxed when you eventually sell a non-dividend stock, but revenue from the company can be re-invested into that company without you ever having to pay taxes on it. And overall you get more control. If you have a bunch of stocks doing well and you suddenly lose your job, you can sell some off taking less of a tax hit (do to your smaller overall income).
