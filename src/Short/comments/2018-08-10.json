I agree with your views on how it's going to power the future, but what causes the cyclicality is the capital expenditure cycle in the industry. Since building a fab takes a ton of resources and time, the semiconductor industry isn't able to move quickly to address changes in demand. So when demand for chips starts ramping up, manufacturers start to ramp their production in turn, increasing capital expenditures either through factory/capacity upgrades or building new sites.  Production ramps can take a year to begin but they're typically shorter. \n\nHowever, once demand starts to slow, companies cant just put a halt to their current production and focus on something else. The whole process of turning raw material wafers into tested and packaged transistors/chips takes time and effort. This puts semiconductor companies in a bad position because now they have potentially billions of dollars spent on capacity upgrades at fabs that might be being utilized below 50% capacity. \n\nThis is often times why semiconductor stocks trade at extremely low PE values even though they may be killing it on both revenue and EPS results. \n\nNot in any way telling you to go long/short semis, it's just something that not everyone thinks about at times. Check out Micron if you want an example of a company that's performed extremely well yet trades at a single-digit PE (currently 5.1) after increasing over 400% in a little over 2 years.

I have brought lots of semiconductor stock today after the downgrade, what do you all thing?\n\nThank you", "parent_text": "One thing to consider, whether you're long or short, is how cyclical the semiconductor industry is. I agree with your views on how it's going to power the future, but what causes the cyclicality is the capital expenditure cycle in the industry. Since building a fab takes a ton of resources and time, the semiconductor industry isn't able to move quickly to address changes in demand. So when demand for chips starts ramping up, manufacturers start to ramp their production in turn, increasing capital expenditures either through factory/capacity upgrades or building new sites.  Production ramps can take a year to begin but they're typically shorter. \n\nHowever, once demand starts to slow, companies cant just put a halt to their current production and focus on something else. The whole process of turning raw material wafers into tested and packaged transistors/chips takes time and effort. This puts semiconductor companies in a bad position because now they have potentially billions of dollars spent on capacity upgrades at fabs that might be being utilized below 50% capacity. \n\nThis is often times why semiconductor stocks trade at extremely low PE values even though they may be killing it on both revenue and EPS results. \n\nNot in any way telling you to go long/short semis, it's just something that not everyone thinks about at times. Check out Micron if you want an example of a company that's performed extremely well yet trades at a single-digit PE (currently 5.1) after increasing over 400% in a little over 2 years.

But who knows how long before the stock gets bought out?.. \n\nMy question: how long is Tesla going to wait before making a public announcement about going private or not? Because shorts will get wrecked afterwards.\n\nNow a second thing is, will going private be a good thing? At first glance it seems as though it would be. No more annoying press talk about every little thing Elon does or Tesla fuckups, etc. No more focus on short term profit and no more pressure to (((keep))) the numbers good.\nHowever, there\u2019s a factor that comes into play here: someone is funding Elon the 70~ Billion dollars. They most likely get a big say in the direction the company is headed, potentially ruining the company and what it stands for.

Core thesis points are below (from my investment firm Titan, which owns both stocks). Also I included what we think others are missing when they say to not own either of the stocks.\n\n**AMZN:**\n\n* Amazon is the dominant online retailer capturing more than 50% of all retail and enterprise IT spend shifting online. Its combination of wide selection, low prices, and fast delivery creates a flywheel which widens its economic moat over time.\n* Amazon Web Services is potentially a $250B+ business today and a major contributor to Amazon\u2019s free cash flow. It enables businesses to outsource their IT infrastructure at a very low cost, creating a sticky and recurring revenue stream for AMZN.\n* The company will continue taking share in many other $100B+ verticals, including delivery, content, and search advertising. These remain highly under-penetrated markets offering a long runway of potential growth.\n\n**What are people missing?**\n\n* Many investors tend to focus on Amazon's present day profits and P/E ratios, metrics upon which the company looks weak. What they're missing is that these results are a deliberate strategic decision by CEO Jeff Bezos. Amazon's earnings are artificially low because the company is making massive growth investments to make its flywheel spin even faster. The return on invested capital (ROIC) of its retail and cloud businesses is 25-40%, which means every dollar reinvested internally becomes more valuable over time. But because ROIC isn't readily observable in financial news, most investors miss this critical detail.\n* The market's short-term focus means Amazon is consistently undervalued compared to its long-term intrinsic value.\n\n**AAPL:**\n\n* Apple's brand and closed ecosystem creates a loyal community of users with high switching costs, where even if they might prefer some non-Apple device better, the ecosystem (iTunes, apps, etc.) keeps them with Apple. This gives Apple a wide economic moat.\n* Its unique ability to combine beautifully designed hardware with its easy-to-use software/app ecosystem makes it more of a consumer company than a technology company. It's priced far too cheaply for a leading consumer brand.\n* The consistent free cash flow from its software and services business enables it to enter markets that investors don't yet anticipate. Many of these bets will be home runs but are not yet reflected in the stock's valuation.\n\n**What are people missing?**\n\n* The main investor concern is Apple's product concentration risk. Over 60% of its sales come from iPhones, and smartphone growth has slowed in recent years due to highly saturated markets in the U.S. and Western Europe.\n* While we agree that smartphone growth will continue to slow in Apple's more mature markets, it has plenty of untapped pricing power on the iPhones it sells. Although unit growth may slow, prices should continue to rise, yielding continued sales growth.\n* Notably, Apple's software and services ecosystem is also rapidly growing, which most investors don't fully appreciate.", "score": 5, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 9, "submission_ratio": 0.5555555555555556, "submission_title": "AAPL or AMZN", "submission_text": "I\u2019m thinking of investing $200 a month into AMZN via M1, working my way up to owning a full share of AMZN stock.

Core thesis points are below (from my investment firm Titan, which owns both stocks). Also I included what we think others are missing when they say to not own either of the stocks.\n\n**AMZN:**\n\n* Amazon is the dominant online retailer capturing more than 50% of all retail and enterprise IT spend shifting online. Its combination of wide selection, low prices, and fast delivery creates a flywheel which widens its economic moat over time.\n* Amazon Web Services is potentially a $250B+ business today and a major contributor to Amazon\u2019s free cash flow. It enables businesses to outsource their IT infrastructure at a very low cost, creating a sticky and recurring revenue stream for AMZN.\n* The company will continue taking share in many other $100B+ verticals, including delivery, content, and search advertising. These remain highly under-penetrated markets offering a long runway of potential growth.\n\n**What are people missing?**\n\n* Many investors tend to focus on Amazon's present day profits and P/E ratios, metrics upon which the company looks weak. What they're missing is that these results are a deliberate strategic decision by CEO Jeff Bezos. Amazon's earnings are artificially low because the company is making massive growth investments to make its flywheel spin even faster. The return on invested capital (ROIC) of its retail and cloud businesses is 25-40%, which means every dollar reinvested internally becomes more valuable over time. But because ROIC isn't readily observable in financial news, most investors miss this critical detail.\n* The market's short-term focus means Amazon is consistently undervalued compared to its long-term intrinsic value.\n\n**AAPL:**\n\n* Apple's brand and closed ecosystem creates a loyal community of users with high switching costs, where even if they might prefer some non-Apple device better, the ecosystem (iTunes, apps, etc.) keeps them with Apple. This gives Apple a wide economic moat.\n* Its unique ability to combine beautifully designed hardware with its easy-to-use software/app ecosystem makes it more of a consumer company than a technology company. It's priced far too cheaply for a leading consumer brand.\n* The consistent free cash flow from its software and services business enables it to enter markets that investors don't yet anticipate. Many of these bets will be home runs but are not yet reflected in the stock's valuation.\n\n**What are people missing?**\n\n* The main investor concern is Apple's product concentration risk. Over 60% of its sales come from iPhones, and smartphone growth has slowed in recent years due to highly saturated markets in the U.S. and Western Europe.\n* While we agree that smartphone growth will continue to slow in Apple's more mature markets, it has plenty of untapped pricing power on the iPhones it sells. Although unit growth may slow, prices should continue to rise, yielding continued sales growth.\n* Notably, Apple's software and services ecosystem is also rapidly growing, which most investors don't fully appreciate.", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.2}, {"time": 1533930831.0, "submission_id": "969dny", "comment_id": "e3yx0t3", "body": "It is not worth diversifying your investments if your portfolio value is under 2.5k imo.

Investors want their money back (profits).

I'm expecting us to reach the 52wk high either next week or the week after, and set a new ATH. We have yet another round of big earnings coming out this week and I doubt people will still be talking about the Lira too much\n\n. As far as running out of momentum, I have to disagree as well. In march-April I'd have agreed with this entire post but to me the market is clearly ready to exit this correction, and the fact it hasn't already is really down to all the tariff tweeting which really threw it for a loop a few times. Companies are reporting huge earnings and raising guidance left and right for the 3rd straight quarter now, and for me I think that shows the January optimism was well founded, albeit much too fast. The only thing that will cause a major correction in the NEAR term IMO would be a surprise in the CPI come September, or US involvement in a major armed conflict, which looks pretty unlikely.

For example, I believe Elon has reached the epitome of stock manipulation by announcing an lbo before the financing has actually been placed. It is hard to fathom the capability for someone to announce something greater than a buyout in regard to their stock price. Furthermore, I decided to short the position at 370 because if the lbo were true, at a $4000 position, rising from 370 -> 420 I would lose approx $500. Now, these losses are sizable, but not the end of the world. However, on the plus side, if the lbo fell through, and faith was lost in Elon, the stock would surely return to its pivot price around 300. That doesn't even include the price drop to S1, because people have lost faith in the word of Elon. So for my own decision, I am willing to risk $500 max (of course the stock can rise past $420 in the event that it gets bought out for a higher price, but unlikely) when the potential for profit is over $800 at the minimum. To me, shorting Tesla at 370 was an easy decision, the losses are already hedged against the buyout price, and the short options are very enticing. \n\nNow, you raise a good question. What metrics have pushed me towards my decision? Perhaps I should dig deeper into the exact reasoning why this Tweet would be any differ than all the others. As mentioned before, I summed his lbo tweet as the maximum level of lies that could be used, and if this lbo fell through, it would be extremely hard to recover. Additionally, if you analyze the pivot point metric, you will see it has just lowered below the S1 line, this implies a directional movement towards the pivot point. On that alone, I am willing to take my position. \n\nHowever, I will admit, the future of this company currently resides in the ability of Elon to provide prove of financials in place for an lbo. Personally, I believe that Elon had an offer and got super excited, wanted to rub it in the faces of shorts, so he announced it over twitter, before anything had been approved, and it eventually will fall through.\n\nIn regard to your question, I believe the time is now because I don't believe there is a statistic to top an lbo option. if this falls through, the profit will reign. \n\nCheers.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 5, "submission_ratio": 0.2, "submission_title": "Extensive TSLA Review", "submission_text": "[removed]", "parent_text": "Why do you think Elon suddenly looses control of the hype game now?
