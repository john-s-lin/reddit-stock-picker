So there's not even an opportunity cost lost in making this Diablo game.\n\nThe only thing that this changes is hardcore Diablo fans are now discouraged from going to Blizzcon, but seriously, how much of ATVI's revenue is Blizzcon tickets, and how many people go to Blizzcon for the Diablo content?\n\nAnd additionally, Blizzard is less than 1/3 of ATVI, and Diablo-related sales make up probably less than 1/4 of Blizzard's revenues, so this is extremely minor.\n", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.14285714285714285}, {"time": 1541387798.0, "submission_id": "9u9sjk", "comment_id": "e92q2fv", "body": "Oh yeah EA has been pissing me off with the C&C franchise for over a decade, same with the Sims.

It has performed very well in the bull market. Great execution, but if the economy is slowing it is not something i want to be in. Retail is brutal. When it's good it's really good if managed properly. When its bad, there really is not much you can do because you're so dependent on a strong consumer especially when youre selling high margin, cyclical products like home improvement stuff. You can't just change your inventory like say, a walmart or a costco can. It's a specialty store that is taking on debt and has to employ a lot of people to keep all of the stores open . It has been a great stock to own the last ten years, but at some point the economy will slow and that hits HD harder than most businesses so I do care about the price of the stock because it has run from 36$ to over 200$ in the bull market. That's not a typical \"buy and hold\" stock at all. I would love to put more money in tech but my portfolio needs some exposure to other sectors. I think Walmart and Nike are better buys right here. I'm leaning towards Walmart because it has figured out how to use their dominance of brick and mortar to drive e commerce sales and that is still an area of huge growth for them. They can now advertise a massive amount of skus to be picked up in any store within a day or two and that to me closes the huge gap that amazon has had over them when it comes to convenience.

The biggest question is when does it get legalized, both medicinally and recreationally, on a federal level. A big chunk of the population is ready and wants legalization but politicians have been slow, hesitant, or unwilling to react along with a vocal and strong minority pushing to keep it illegal. That\u2019s the big issue with this stuff. Legalization looks so close yet moves so frustratingly slow. It could be a few years or over a decade before it occurs. Companies will have to have good financials and other forms of revenue to survive in the meanwhile. Eventually you\u2019ll likely see many of these companies fail, merge, or be brought out with maybe 5-10 of them staying around and being successful.\n\nIn terms of investing in these companies, it\u2019s important to realize how much hype comes into play. A lot of these companies are very promising on paper but investors have gotten a bit ahead of themselves with their money. Some of these companies are trading at ridiculous valuations and market caps with many operating at a loss. I\u2019m talking companies with millions in revenue but with market caps in the billions. That makes for a shaky investment that is based more on hype than sound and reasonable points. I\u2019d imagine that even if these companies are successful and cannabis becomes legal on a federal level that it will still take a lot of effort, results, and strong reports to hold these valuations and keep them growing over time.  \n\nI can\u2019t speak on psychedelics as I know next to nothing about them. However I have seen more of a push and seen them mentioned more over the past few months which may indicate a trend moving towards fighting for legalization of them.\n\nCanada has legalized it and has a lot more companies to chose from then the US at the moment. The country is sort of like the guinea pig for the sector right now so it will be interesting to see how it all plays out. Most of the problems with valuations and hype that US companies face is also there with these companies dealing within the cannabis sector in Canada but at least you\u2019ll get a better idea of how they\u2019ll perform with legalization.\n\nI invest a small percentage of my portfolio in the sector but in an ETF rather than any individual companies. I think there is a ton of promise and potential for the sector but I just don\u2019t feel comfortable enough picking the companies on my own. To put it bluntly, there are a lot of crap companies, penny stocks, pump and dumps, or shady companies in the sector so invest wisely and do your homework. A fair deal of individuals have made a ton of money of these companies but just as many have been burned badly. Try to find a company you really like, that has good financials and leadership, and that offers a product/service that has potential/demand but can also survive if legalization is further delayed.\n\nSo unfortunately I don\u2019t have any companies I can recommend and hopefully didn\u2019t waste your time here but I still it\u2019s important to look at it from another point of view. It\u2019s a sector with a ton of potential but also a lot of hype and overvalued or crap companies. You\u2019re going to really want to make sure you know and understand the company and sector you\u2019re investing in.

That\u2019s the big issue with this stuff. Legalization looks so close yet moves so frustratingly slow. It could be a few years or over a decade before it occurs.

A lot of these companies are very promising on paper but investors have gotten a bit ahead of themselves with their money. Some of these companies are trading at ridiculous valuations and market caps with many operating at a loss. I\u2019m talking companies with millions in revenue but with market caps in the billions. That makes for a shaky investment that is based more on hype than sound and reasonable points. I\u2019d imagine that even if these companies are successful and cannabis becomes legal on a federal level that it will still take a lot of effort, results, and strong reports to hold these valuations and keep them growing over time.  \n\nI can\u2019t speak on psychedelics as I know next to nothing about them.

The country is sort of like the guinea pig for the sector right now so it will be interesting to see how it all plays out. Most of the problems with valuations and hype that US companies face is also there with these companies dealing within the cannabis sector in Canada but at least you\u2019ll get a better idea of how they\u2019ll perform with legalization.\n\nI invest a small percentage of my portfolio in the sector but in an ETF rather than any individual companies.

I wouldn't invest in it, it's just not a good business and you want to really focus on strong businesses with good fundamentals and a solid moat - this has neither.\n\n", "parent_score": 18, "parent_ratio": 0.1111111111111111}, {"time": 1541341010.0, "submission_id": "9u3ai4", "comment_id": "e91614e", "body": "That sounds right, thanks for the advice, it'll be helpful down the road.

They also have virtually no chinese exposure. I think the pullback should absolutely be bought there. I like apple because their balance sheet is a fortress and they have pricing power and a loyal user base that they can interact with in so many ways.  I like nonclinical businesses that have loyal customers and good management. Costco stands out there.

The run up was great and I still love the company but I thought the run up was a bit rushed/extreme. I sold my of most gains on other holdings by the end of September as well and really lucked out by doing so. I kept basically all my principal money invested though so I still felt the pain of October like others but at least collected some gains.\n\nAs to what I did with the cash from my Apple gains, nothing yet. I have some orders set up to buy a few companies if they hit a certain price. Microsoft is the main one. ISRG and Visa are the other two. I\u2019m very weary of putting much into the market right now for individual stocks so besides my weekly VTI purchases I\u2019m mostly sitting on any extra money I have. What sucks is if none of these orders hit then I\u2019ll have missed out a modest but still decent sized correction. I admittedly tried timing things so if they don\u2019t go through I def deserve missing out for thinking I could time it.\n\nI really like Microsoft and how they have numerous streams of revenue. Great company with solid books and good leadership. Visa is in the same minus having the flexibility in terms of revenue streams but still a really great company.
