Usually that can happen when competition is strong or a company fails to stay relevant / pivot with their industry.\n\nLet's talk about the moat for a moment. Warren Buffett is a notorious value investor. He essentially tries to find value mismatches where he sees a company as undervalued comparative to the rest of the investment community. With that said, another important component to Buffett's investment style is to find companies with a strong moat. That is, to find companies that have strong defenses against other companies in their industry group or sector. These moats allow some companies to remain the dominant company in their industry regardless of the economy or the overall state of the market.\n\nWith that said, my company is currently partnered with Google, and that's about as far as I'm willing to go into detail on that. But what I can say is that Google has a very strong moat. It's absolutely insane what Google is working on in their development teams and companies. I don't think Google thinks about how much money they can make tomorrow. I think Google thinks about how they can make money for eternity, and if that means losing money tomorrow so be it. Google is positioned very strongly and I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. If they can continue to innovative they will be unstoppable, even if they stall out for a few years.\n\nMy point here is that, no, I don't think some of those companies are maxed out. I think you might be onto something with the idea that a correction or bear market might be coming and tech might take a big hit. As some people have mentioned, many technologies that you posted about are already being worked on by members of FAANG. I know companies like Amazon and Google are working very hard to stay, not only relevant, but to BE the future. Quantum computing, advanced cloud technology, AI technology and application, advanced robotics, and VR are just a few things that companies under FAANG are working on. As you mentioned, though, too, timeframe is an important consideration. If you're wondering if tech is going to explode right now, in the next couple months, probably not. I haven't taken my eye off of FAANG, though. Especially Google. I'm waiting on the sidelines at the moment to watch their development and the development of the US market.\n\nThis doesn't mean that FAANG can't fail. A strong moat can only protect but it cannot project. Companies in FAANG will have to continue to work at being the best at coming out with new content or some other company will do it and that presents an opportunity for failure. I still think of much of FAANG as leaders, though. Only time will tell.\n\nExample using external source information:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/051316/buffetts-moat-how-sustainable-googles-competitive-advantage-googl.asp\n\nI focus on Google as my main example because I generally understand their business the best within the FAANG umbrella.\n\nTLDR - FAANG maxed out, no, I don't think so.

Here is my take. \n\nFacebook is week for a couple reasons but strong for one big one. It's week because it IS so powerful and widely used and therefor influential. Congress wants to regulate it. It's CEO is under intense scrutiny. But then it's users, DON'T REALLY CARE about any of that and will continue to use it because there is no other alternative! It will continue to rake in advertising dollars because its' algorithms provide superior access to the people that advertisers want to reach. It makes money. Don't confuse that with the stock price. \n\nAlphabet. Are you joking? It's a money tree. It controls 90% of search. There are alternatives that nobody uses(Bing). It's algorithms are superior. Advertisers love it, but also are beholden to it's dominance. Because of this, again, it's under scrutiny by regulators. That's just search. What about Android mobile? Largest mobile platform in the WORLD. It dominates mobile. Don't forget it owns YouTube which has a superior (Imo) business model to content than Netflix. It has more users than facebook, and people spend more time on YouTube than Facebook. Advertisers mostly love it, but they'll go wherever the eyeballs are.  Now, the headlines that Google gets are usually over Self Driving cars and their moonshot ideas. But don't forget, years ago, everyone said they were insane for trying to map the world and take a photo of every street on the planet. And now, Google Maps is $4 billion a year in revenue. Don't bet against Google's \"other bets\". Also, their smartphone is superior to other phones, it's just not cool enough yet, but gaining traction, even if it's very small. Google may be maturing, but it's a long term hold if you think the internet will exist in 20 years. \n\nApple: They haven't blown our minds in a long time with a new product. But they have a giant installed user based just like Microsoft did 20 years ago. I think they are a mature company with less rocket like growth ahead of them, but the stock is pretty cheap on a relative basis. If they can grow in other areas such as content and services they will be around. Right now it does seem that Cook is content with incremental growth instead of new products. \n\nNetflix is stupid. This is my least favorite of the FANGS. I've been wrong on their stock price for years. But I'm not wrong on their business model. Which HAS to change. Here is why. They finance their expensive content creation with debt. They spend more on content than HBO and Disney. And they have to borrow money in junk bonds to do so. Their cashflow is negative to zero! They don't really have any profits. Their competition is growing every day. Amazon Prime, YouTube, AppleTV, Disney all have or will have streaming services. Content is expensive and they have only ONE way to pay for it, debt. Whereas Amazon has prime memberships and a retail to subsidize. Disney has theater ticket sales, and YouTube has FREE content! Think about it, Netflix has 1 of 2 choices. Either they start placing ads in their stream, or they raise their monthly fees. They can't keep borrowing forever. With rates rising is that good for their debt? nope. Their last earnings report was not great, but they added subs, which is all they anyone seems to look at. But they are nothing but another channel. \n\nAmazon is the most powerful in my opinion. It's the one to own now. Not only does it control 50% of internet retail, it has other bets in other industries that it can disrupt easily if it chooses to. It could disrupt UPS and FedX simply buy doing all their own shipping in house. They own a fleet of Boeing jets.  It has Prime, which is like a Costco membership, a Spotify membership and a Netflix account for one price.  Amazon music is better than Spotify (just not as popular), Prime is about as good as Netflix and same day delivery and 2 day delivery is killing brick and mortar this holiday season.  Whole Foods is soon going to have Pharmacy options that will disrupt WalGreens and CVS. Which is BILLIONS . Oops I forget to mention AWS. Which is the number 1 cloud business by a LONG SHOT. With huge margins and BILLIONS AND BILLIONS in revenue. And they are soon to get the Pentagon contract as well. This company can do almost anything. I say almost because it has had hardware product failures. But Alexa is a massive win along with FireTV but its' phone was not. \n\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 229, "submission_ratio": 0.013100436681222707, "submission_title": "Is FANG maxed out?

Which companies are you investing for said tech?\n\nEDIT 1: totally forgot about VR/AR", "parent_text": "There are certainly instances of big companies like those in FAANG failing, maxing out, or stalling out but I don't think that's what we're seeing with FAANG. Usually that can happen when competition is strong or a company fails to stay relevant / pivot with their industry.\n\nLet's talk about the moat for a moment. Warren Buffett is a notorious value investor. He essentially tries to find value mismatches where he sees a company as undervalued comparative to the rest of the investment community. With that said, another important component to Buffett's investment style is to find companies with a strong moat. That is, to find companies that have strong defenses against other companies in their industry group or sector. These moats allow some companies to remain the dominant company in their industry regardless of the economy or the overall state of the market.\n\nWith that said, my company is currently partnered with Google, and that's about as far as I'm willing to go into detail on that. But what I can say is that Google has a very strong moat. It's absolutely insane what Google is working on in their development teams and companies. I don't think Google thinks about how much money they can make tomorrow. I think Google thinks about how they can make money for eternity, and if that means losing money tomorrow so be it. Google is positioned very strongly and I don't think they're going anywhere anytime soon. If they can continue to innovative they will be unstoppable, even if they stall out for a few years.\n\nMy point here is that, no, I don't think some of those companies are maxed out. I think you might be onto something with the idea that a correction or bear market might be coming and tech might take a big hit. As some people have mentioned, many technologies that you posted about are already being worked on by members of FAANG. I know companies like Amazon and Google are working very hard to stay, not only relevant, but to BE the future. Quantum computing, advanced cloud technology, AI technology and application, advanced robotics, and VR are just a few things that companies under FAANG are working on. As you mentioned, though, too, timeframe is an important consideration. If you're wondering if tech is going to explode right now, in the next couple months, probably not. I haven't taken my eye off of FAANG, though. Especially Google. I'm waiting on the sidelines at the moment to watch their development and the development of the US market.\n\nThis doesn't mean that FAANG can't fail. A strong moat can only protect but it cannot project. Companies in FAANG will have to continue to work at being the best at coming out with new content or some other company will do it and that presents an opportunity for failure. I still think of much of FAANG as leaders, though. Only time will tell.\n\nExample using external source information:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/051316/buffetts-moat-how-sustainable-googles-competitive-advantage-googl.asp\n\nI focus on Google as my main example because I generally understand their business the best within the FAANG umbrella.\n\nTLDR - FAANG maxed out, no, I don't think so.

We will maintain our $118 fair value estimate and no-moat rating.\n\nResults across Prudential's segments were somewhat mixed, but the company generally saw some mild weakness domestically, which was offset by earnings growth internationally. International results were buoyed by fairly strong top-line growth.\n\nThe investment management business has been a bright spot for Prudential, but reported results took a turn for the worse in the third quarter. Given that this business is the only area within Prudential that we believe might benefit from an economic moat, we think it is a key segment to watch. Adjusted operating income fell 11% year over year, but this appears to be driven largely by quarterly noise, and the underlying trend, in our view, remains quite positive. During the quarter, net inflows were $8.7 billion, with strong flows on the institutional side slightly offset by some minor retail outflows. The inflow level marks a strong acceleration from recent results, and with 90% of assets under management outperforming the five-year benchmark, Prudential looks poised to maintain its momentum, although markets have become a bit more volatile recently.\"", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 15, "submission_ratio": 0.2, "submission_title": "Thoughts on $PRU as a value investment?", "submission_text": "I am relatively new to investing and I've decided to give the value investing approach a try.
