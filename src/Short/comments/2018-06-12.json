It might be big among tech enthusiasts, but 4G is perfectly adequate for 99% of the general population and I don't think a lot of people will be able to justify spending $600+ on a new phone specifically for a speed boost they don't need.\n\nAmerican Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI), and SBA Communications (SBAC) are the biggest 3 tower companies [according to Forbes](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/15/top-3-cell-tower-companies-in-the-us.aspx). \n\nI would research those companies and see what they've said publicly about 5G plans.  \n\n**EDIT**:  This spawned some more research by me.  This article offered some great insight into how tower companies operate https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-american-tower-even-bigger-130150159.html\n\nTwo main things I took away from that article:\n\n* Tower companies only own the land and the physical towers.  Tenants, such as Verizon, Sprint, etc. lease space on the tower to put up their own transmitters.\n* Cell company mergers harm tower companies because that leaves fewer tenants, and therefore less revenue for the tower companies.  Something to watch out for.\n\nThis also begs the question.. if a tower company only owns the towers and the land, and tenants are responsible for transmitters.. how much can 5G actually create revenue growth for tower companies since 5G is in the transmitter, not the tower?  Unless the nature of 5G just demands more towers, I'm not sure about that.

In the short term it is likely they will be less profitable, however, due to working out production bugs. In any case, this being an obvious way to play 5G means that any upside is likely already priced in. If I can think of it, the market already has. QCOM might be more an Internet of Things (IoT) play, as the explosion of smart connected devices will significantly increase demand for mobile chipsets. Some of this is priced in, too, but if you feel like the market is misunderestimating the IoT sector, it might still be a buy, just not because of 5G.\n\nThat leaves infrastructure. New cell site equipment will be needed. Ericcson (ERIC) is an obvious play here. So is Nokia (NOK) after their acquisition of Alcatel/Lucent a few years back. Both companies divested their handset businesses a while ago and are focused entirely on networking at this point, with a heavy emphasis on mobile. But I'd be worried that future prospects are already priced in to the stock. After all, we know roughly how many sites there are and about how much profit is in upgrading each, or we can find that out pretty easily. Still, this is where I'd start looking.\n\nThe other big players in mobile infrastructure are Huawei and ZTE, Chinese companies whose products are not widely used in the US. Huawei is privately held.

There's an upcoming (mid-July I believe) trial between Aurelius & UNIT's larger tenant, Windstream. A lot of people are being on the Aurelius suit being tossed out, which basically means that Aurelius won't be able to force WIN into default on their bonds, which gives them a much longer timeline to deal with their debt load.\nThis matters because as it stands, WIN accounts for 67% of UNIT's rev (down from 100% when UNIT was spun off in 2015). That extra time will (ideally) allow UNIT to continue diversifying away from WIN, so that if/when WIN is unable to deal with their debt, impact on UNIT will be far less significant/minimal.\n\nUNIT still sports a 10%+ dividend yield ($2.40/year) and a stock price of $30 would bring that to 8%, which effectively opens back up the possibility of equity raises for capital, which was one of the biggest worries for them when the div was 13%+ (that liquidity from other sources would dry up, and they wouldn't be able to issue stock because it was too expensive, and thus wouldn't be able to keep diversifying away from WIN - that's looking less and less likely now).\n\nA lot of this hinges on the court case, but so far it looks like the court & WIN's bondholders have been on WIN's side, so people are generally expecting a good outcome there. We'll see!\n\nDisclosure - UNIT is my largest equity holding lol, up almost 40% (not including divies) and I got lucky with an options play that's up 2,400% (oh how I wish I'd put more money into that \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25)", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 90, "submission_ratio": 0.011111111111111112, "submission_title": "5G Phones coming soon", "submission_text": "I've been beginning to hear a buzz about new 5G tech coming for cell phones, and was looking to pool together info with you all on it.
