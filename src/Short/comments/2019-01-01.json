It is not in China's self interest to harm USA as they are a major trade partner. I'm not saying they play fair but IMO every country fights dirty. Play Risk, America has the luxury from being shielded from geopolitical threats because our neighbors are Canada and Mexico. Can you imagine being next to Russia or China???\n\n\nHonestly, if Trump was not president things would go the other way. Democratic regimes would probably work with China and keep Russia at bay. But Trump was paid off by Russians so he's working with Russia to keep China at bay. \n\nRussia is the evil genius in all of this because of its manipulation and the attrition between USA and China will hurt both countries to strengthen Russia.

America prob does the most hacking it just doesn't get reported. Britain hacks too etc. \n\n\nAmerica prides itself on being the global police force which is good and bad depending on what side you're on. America has military bases around the world ready to deploy at any moment. We think it's cool because it \"protects us\" but what if you're on the other side of the equation and Russia starts setting up military bases in Latin America and Cuba???
