So for example your rent might be 10 shares of SPY, and your groceries might cost 1-1.5 shares of SPY a month. Your paycheck is 30 shares of SPY a month. In this hypothetical world you even took out a loan from a bank for 4000 shares of SPY so that you could buy your first home. You are paying back this loan with a few shares of SPY each month for 30 years at a pre-agreed interest rate.\n\nSo imagine you have a buddy, who usually buys things like bonds and real estate which he hopes to sell later for even more shares of SPY than they originally cost him so that he makes a profit. One day he comes to you with a hot tip and says \"hey I heard the government created this new thing, 'federal reserve notes' aka 'dollars'. It's got all these cool features, like that *everyone has to* accept these dollars for payment of goods and services if you want to use them. I think this is going to be the next hot thing! I'm going to buy 2800 dollars, which costs 10 shares of SPY, and if my chart analysis is correct then in a month or so I think I'll be able to sell these 2800 dollars for 11 shares of SPY.

So it seems that the by being aware of technicals, the market can compensate for them. So for a professor to accurately backtest a modern technical strategy they would need to be on the cutting edge of technical work, which honestly is not going to happen outside of a hedge fund. \n\nThe second factor is that academics relies on published papers. But if you found one of these new technical strategies why would you publish it? Your incentives are much higher use it in a hedge fund yourself/or sell the IP to a hedge fund. So without papers on TA, academia as a whole will not believe it to exist.\n\nThe important thing I eventually decided was that real-world evidence beats academic papers and what professors think. This doesn\u2019t go for just technical analysis. If you know that people out there are consistently making money trading using X, and have been for a long time in different market conditions, then X matters to the market.  \n\nTLDR: You need to look no further than the efficient market hypothesis, to find that real-world evidence and finance academia have gone there separate ways.

I've been investing since the 1980s. I had a theory LOOOONG ago of using computers and programming to predict markets. My mentor told me I was nuts. There is too much that moves the markets that is news/sentiment based which can't be put on a graph or converted into an easy binary, he said.\n\nI tried to program something for ages. And I lived to see algo trading take off in a big way. Though I wasn't part of that ship.\n\nI felt he was right. If the Fed Chief tomorrow says, \"I hate dollars. I think we should all trade peanuts and pretzels.\" The economy would move in ways no algo could possibly predict. That's a silly example, but it shows the chaos of markets and human nature. Not even one human is predictable. Billions certainly aren't.\n\nMy problem with **charting** which has become the poor man's or common TA, is that it tries to make the market simple. It says, \"oh, this is a cup and handle and biscuit and gravy pattern.\" As if the world's algos care about human-perceived images of charts. If a tariff is imposed or employment numbers come back weak or a new oil discovery is found or terrorists launch an attack on [somewhere] the market doesn't care what pattern exists.\n\nThe movie Pi \u03c0.

I am or was an Econ major, social side as I sucked at math at the time.  A couple of my opinions. For one, TA can never have enough quantity or accuracy of input variables. Since I have some time while I wait to, avoid rush hour and it raining, so I can travel across town to have my car repaired.\n\nPredicting driving time commute daily or  recent average is so similar to predicting short and near term price.   All of us have a formula for our commute time.  It takes into account: traffic behavior of other participants,  your past and current understanding of traffic flow which changes as you gain experience in a particular route to and from work. You develop a  loose general pattern understanding of how the traffic works normally and variations that can occur:  your actual time upon entering rush hour,  any special circumstances: rain, high  accident areas, shopping days, school bus, and road work etc. Predicting the combination of circumstances to estimate total drive time plus or minus x minutes equates to a market move up or down call. So even with TA the call is art and luck. Seasoned or mental hardened investors know this and price accordingly.  I wonder how much \"suffering hardship\" is built into TA-- the underlying algorithm seems rather knowledgeable, but sensitive to weathering a storm if you will. At least this is how I explain in part volatility and big daily swings. \n\nFor a excellent insight into \"mental hardening\" the ability to endure physical and mental hardship to achieve a goal, albeit life and death in the book,  peruse the story of  \"Shackelton\" Here is a link to many available versions and an audio book.

Picture the commuter constantly changing lanes to gain a couple of places, rather than one or two lane changes the experienced drivers make, but ends up at the same place as you both exit the urban crawl.\n\nTA back testing, seems borrowed from actuarial science.  However, insurance industry care more about the probability of x number of occurrences with a y confidence, but not who.  As an investor you are the \"who\", your car, and the other drivers of vehicles in your immediate area. Total market basket theory says you can be in many cars, and bet on commute times over and under  for many routes.\n\nMarket influencing powers such as offshore players, all algorithms have unknowns, and unknowable's.   Foreign governments, people, and corporations are motivated by who only knows, both their knowledge of our situations here and their situation there. Foreign  participation in our market, as far as I know, isn't exhaustively reported, so TA would be even more assumptive or just plain ignore much of  this segment.\n\nStill I watch Squawk, and follow speakers that resonate with me, and make my picks. Worked a short while for Dun & Bradstreet, In my interviews, I would asked the more successful CEO, CFO's/ Owners, at least on what they reported in their financials, \"what do you attribute you success?\" To a person every single one had a version of \"lucky break\" in their response.   So I factor anecdotal  bias in everything I hear or see regarding \"gains\" or success.\n\nToday I wonder with ETF how much the swings are just like going surfing everyday at the beach. TA at best tells me what beach the surf is likely to be good, not whether or not I will have a successful day surfing. I don't surf, but I would like to be on beach today.\n\nDoing your own research and thought processing will best serve you, but gaining command of your calls it takes a long time-- decades even.  I feel TA's selling point is is to shorten the time needed to be in command of market decisions from decades to years . \n\nLooks like it's stopped raining and it 90 minutes later so off I go to get the car fixed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 74, "submission_ratio": 0.013513513513513514, "submission_title": "The Arguments for and Against Technical Analysis", "submission_text": "I am a finance major in university and have had both TA's and professors tell me that TA is all garbage based on their back-testing and statistical analysis.
