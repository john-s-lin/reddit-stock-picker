I support your decision and have joined u with March 130 calls.\n\nThis is January low folks. We will have Madden, NBA live & Fifa sales reporting in the next two earnings. Not everything is about battlefield... why do you guys harp on EA's FPS games?.. when their number one seller has always been Fifa... And even so Battlefield 5 wont do bad either... even with the /r/games' love-to-hate EA hype train. Battlefield has its core fans who will continue to buy battlefield. And the ww2 setting is more appealing than... ww1(previous title). Even with the nonsensical horrible PR relating to this game, it wont be a battlefront 2. Believe me, battlefield series is near dear to alot of ppl. I hate EA as much as the next person as a consumer but I never miss out on a battlefield game.\n\nFifa will whoop ass as it always does. No complaints from fans there. Madden and NBA will do decent (NBA 2k will still dominate basketball, however NFL fans have no choice but to buy EA's Madden)\n\nSo from a diversfied stand point... things are looking good at current price for us investors.\n\nI am still heavy on TTWO over EA. And If EA continues to bleed and does horrible in the upcoming earning on the 25th of october, you'd bet your ass I would load up for the following earnings when christmas sales, all the sport games sales and battlefield 5 sales get complied together for a juicy Q4 2019 report. They managed to go from the current price to 140 based on that last year's title being Madden, Battlefront and Fifa... you know the year EA's PR stunt was magnitudes worse with battlefront 2 that it broke records of the most downvoted comment on reddit. And battlefront is no way near as popular as battlefield.. so the sales will still net more this year over last years' FPS game.\n\nAlso just realize Battlefield 5 was to come out on the 29th... so the next earnings(25th) woulda been a flop anyways (in case you were bullish because of BF5, right now) so it doesn't affect the true bull earnings which is Q4 2019. If anything you got yourself an amazing price, unfortunately because of an actual shooting in the states (which has nothing to do with the games themselves) & a delay of a game which wouldn't affect the upcoming earnings anyways. These are no causes to suddenly think EA is worse now than it was 3 months ago.\n\nAlso please note that pre order sales are record low across the board because of digital downloads. The whole purpose of pre orders is to buy a physical copy that you can pick up from the store the day of the release without having to wait. Now that gaming companies dont have this pre sales at magnitudes before because of the change in the industry/technology... they relay on shitty little gifts to promote pre sales (playing beta, offering free shit in game, etc).\n\nOP... I dont agree with your price per share/market cap prediction however. Its absurd but I understand your bullish sentiment/excitement.", "score": 63, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 492, "submission_ratio": 0.12804878048780488, "submission_title": "Just bought $500,000 worth of EA.

They're focused on trying to capture the audience who isn't interested in them in the first place.\n\nI hope that $500,000 is only 5% or less of your account value, it still has much farther to fall.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 492, "submission_ratio": 0.006097560975609756, "submission_title": "Just bought $500,000 worth of EA.

Mar 2019 130 calls are cheap af for how far out they are. I'm getting in on this.\n\nEDIT 2: Earnings wouldn't necessarily have been a flop if guidance was that the game was going to come out on time.\n\nEDIT 3: EA is seeing competition in some key areas. Keep in mind they are a very highly valued company and that if they can't compete in the market, they will see that drop very quickly.\n\nAgree with you overall. No idea where a $300 / share price point could come from. That assumes people just keep buying the stock and not selling, which they might do if EA was in a less volatile market... But I think we may be rounding off on the microtransaction hype that added value to a lot of game companies.\n\nThe remainder of the gaming market is going to have to stay on its toes.", "score": 15, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 492, "submission_ratio": 0.03048780487804878, "submission_title": "Just bought $500,000 worth of EA.

I support your decision and have joined u with March 130 calls.\n\nThis is January low folks. We will have Madden, NBA live & Fifa sales reporting in the next two earnings. Not everything is about battlefield... why do you guys harp on EA's FPS games?.. when their number one seller has always been Fifa... And even so Battlefield 5 wont do bad either... even with the /r/games' love-to-hate EA hype train. Battlefield has its core fans who will continue to buy battlefield. And the ww2 setting is more appealing than... ww1(previous title). Even with the nonsensical horrible PR relating to this game, it wont be a battlefront 2. Believe me, battlefield series is near dear to alot of ppl. I hate EA as much as the next person as a consumer but I never miss out on a battlefield game.\n\nFifa will whoop ass as it always does. No complaints from fans there. Madden and NBA will do decent (NBA 2k will still dominate basketball, however NFL fans have no choice but to buy EA's Madden)\n\nSo from a diversfied stand point... things are looking good at current price for us investors.\n\nI am still heavy on TTWO over EA. And If EA continues to bleed and does horrible in the upcoming earning on the 25th of october, you'd bet your ass I would load up for the following earnings when christmas sales, all the sport games sales and battlefield 5 sales get complied together for a juicy Q4 2019 report. They managed to go from the current price to 140 based on that last year's title being Madden, Battlefront and Fifa... you know the year EA's PR stunt was magnitudes worse with battlefront 2 that it broke records of the most downvoted comment on reddit. And battlefront is no way near as popular as battlefield.. so the sales will still net more this year over last years' FPS game.\n\nAlso just realize Battlefield 5 was to come out on the 29th... so the next earnings(25th) woulda been a flop anyways (in case you were bullish because of BF5, right now) so it doesn't affect the true bull earnings which is Q4 2019. If anything you got yourself an amazing price, unfortunately because of an actual shooting in the states (which has nothing to do with the games themselves) & a delay of a game which wouldn't affect the upcoming earnings anyways. These are no causes to suddenly think EA is worse now than it was 3 months ago.\n\nAlso please note that pre order sales are record low across the board because of digital downloads. The whole purpose of pre orders is to buy a physical copy that you can pick up from the store the day of the release without having to wait. Now that gaming companies dont have this pre sales at magnitudes before because of the change in the industry/technology... they relay on shitty little gifts to promote pre sales (playing beta, offering free shit in game, etc).\n\nOP...

It's the same thing with kids books/movies/tv shows, shlocky writing, acting, set design etc doesn't matter because the audience doesn't know better, and by the time they start noticing, they won't be the core audience anymore. This is my experience with gaming over the past 20 years, I noticed how things changed but the same issues would constantly exist and never be addressed in most games year after year. Maybe as more of my generation and younger continue to play games things might change, but generally when you get older you get too busy, you have kids, have a job, have chores and shit to do so you treat games as more and more as a casual hobby than a more involved thing, so you stop caring about the politics or the schlock writing, or whatever.

If not, I would pull all or some of my money and invest in bond indexes. \n\n* Is the stock I picked likely to outperform the S&P 500? If yes, I would consider holding. If not, sell and put the money in VOO (or a similar index)\n\n* Have I identified a better stock? If yes, sell some or all of your current stock and use the proceeds to buy the new stock. If not, hold. \n\nFrom there you decide on the specifics. Do you want to take some money out to reward yourself for your success? Would you like to take on some riskier investments?

They remind me a lot of stores like Kmart or JC Penny where they appear to be in rough shape while their competitors have either died out or managed to survive by adjusting themselves for the better. Rite Aid just seems stuck and slowly dying.\n\nLooking at them from a numbers standpoint it\u2019s even uglier. Revenue has declined on basically all fronts and they\u2019re closing stores. They\u2019re pretty leveraged and carry a fair chunk of debt. They\u2019re relying more on storefront sales and less on pharmaceutical the past couple years. Expenses and costs of revenue went up in terms of percentages despite declines in revenue. Competition is super tough already with CVS and Walgreens and is likely to get worse with Walmart growing in popularity within the pharmacy sector and Amazon trying to get involved. What happens during a recession or even just a mild decline once this bull market runs its course?\n\nThey rely on roughly 34% of their revenue from the retail/storefront side and despite reliance increasing in this end, I think that aspect is only going to get hit harder in years to come with companies like Amazon eating away at them. More and more people are also getting their prescriptions online and at the very least want drive through windows yet only slightly over 50% of RiteAid stores offer them. The lack of drive through windows and a quality online/shipping set up or program doesn\u2019t seem very appealing. Where is the growth or money going to come from over the next few years?\n\nI don\u2019t know, man. They just seem outdated and on their last legs. I think they\u2019ll still be around for a little while longer but it wouldn\u2019t shock if they\u2019re not around in 7-10 years either. I just think there are so many better options out there than RiteAid and even if it might be a decent value play that it\u2019s not worth risk and potential headaches. I haven\u2019t really looked into them being brought out by someone or if that\u2019s even realistic but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good company.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 0.5, "submission_title": "RAD Rite Aid", "submission_text": "Glanced at it during lunch and wanted to dive into it this weekend.
