When the institutions start to buy in that's probably a good time to go in yourself. There's a lot of cash on the sidelines right now. Wait to see if cash is still leaving or coming back. If big cash comes back into the market where you would like to invest then there will likely be a wave to ride up. If cash keeps leaving then the market will keep going down.\n\nYou can use all the fundamental statistics that you want but the reality is that the price action and volume tell you the whole story.\n\nIf you're trying to time the market and beat the institutions; well, break a leg! Some people do that and it does require a lot of hard work. In my opinion, though, it's easier to work smarter and just follow the money and ride the coattails with price action and volume.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf you're an investor (rather than a trader), however, I wouldn't try to time anything. I would simply put my money in and let the market naturally march upward over many years (30-50). If you want to be a long term investor but you want to be slightly more active to limit your downside losses I have seen some backtests that indicate if you were to use moving averages in previous market crashes you could have drastically limited your downside. For example, one of the systems went to cash when the S&P price action crossed under the 200 SMA. This system has some false signals, as you can see in the current market climate; but another one (with less false signals) was when the 50 SMA crossed under the 200 SMA on the S&P and then the portfolio would go to cash. Then when the 50 SMA crossed back above the 200 SMA the portfolio goes back in to the market. This was based on a portfolio that consisted only of S&P (SPY) I believe but I could be wrong. One could even adapt this system to filter false signals by waiting 5-10 (or even 30) trading days AFTER the cross over to make sure it isn't a false signal.\n\nThis system keeps you almost always in the market until a big pullback. The backtest that I saw shows that these systems did limit the downside in the long run but it wasn't designed for someone that's looking to be active and beat the market by wild numbers every year.\n\n\u200b\n\nEDIT: The market might rally!

Many people completely blow up their account when they first start trading.\n\nWith that being said, the hard work might only be when you're initially learning to trade if you're a smart person. Personally, I don't like to work hard at anything if I don't have to. I put in a lot of time learning to trade effectively and I've been able to find and develop a system for myself that requires pretty minimal work and I'm super active in the market, at the same time. I have a position on right now that I opened today and I'm closing it tomorrow. If all goes well I'll see a 1% return on my overall portfolio with that trade.

Some examples are below, but you should consider seeking legal counsel about your specific situation.\n\nOne, which others have mentioned, is if your referrals constitute such a large portion of business that it could move share prices. If you buy or sell based on your special knowledge of those orders, that could be insider trading. Doesn't mean you can't own stock, but if you are in that situation you should consider setting up your purchases and sales in an structured manner like auto-purchasing shares each month, so that you take your inside knowledge out of the equation.\n\nAnother is if you have any legal duty to the people you are referring to this business. A fiduciary will have a duty to refer people to the supplier who is best for them. When you are making these referrals, you may be doing so because it is what is best for you. That kind of conflict of interests is why people like lawyers and reputable financial advisors avoid owning stock in companies that might be involved in their work, but most jobs don't come with those kinds of ethics rules. (Note, this is why it is a bad idea to take financial advice from someone who does not owe you a fiduciary duty!)\n\nA third related possibility is that you could be in danger of violating your duty of loyalty to your employer. If you have the authority to make these sorts of decisions on your company's behalf, and you continue using this company due to your financial self-interest rather than because it is the best option for your company, that would be a breach of your obligations as an employee. Usually that means it's a firing offense, but sometimes those situations if they go too far can rise to the level of fraud.\n\nIf none of those situations apply?

", "parent_text": "Generally this is fine, but there are some exceptions that may or may not apply to your situation. Some examples are below, but you should consider seeking legal counsel about your specific situation.\n\nOne, which others have mentioned, is if your referrals constitute such a large portion of business that it could move share prices. If you buy or sell based on your special knowledge of those orders, that could be insider trading. Doesn't mean you can't own stock, but if you are in that situation you should consider setting up your purchases and sales in an structured manner like auto-purchasing shares each month, so that you take your inside knowledge out of the equation.\n\nAnother is if you have any legal duty to the people you are referring to this business. A fiduciary will have a duty to refer people to the supplier who is best for them. When you are making these referrals, you may be doing so because it is what is best for you. That kind of conflict of interests is why people like lawyers and reputable financial advisors avoid owning stock in companies that might be involved in their work, but most jobs don't come with those kinds of ethics rules. (Note, this is why it is a bad idea to take financial advice from someone who does not owe you a fiduciary duty!)\n\nA third related possibility is that you could be in danger of violating your duty of loyalty to your employer. If you have the authority to make these sorts of decisions on your company's behalf, and you continue using this company due to your financial self-interest rather than because it is the best option for your company, that would be a breach of your obligations as an employee.

But from all the research I've done with my limited resources, their reputation is still stellar, They have an amazing logistics network that they're now started to monetize and they continue to invest if other businesses. Add to that, that they have a partnership with Walmart and Google. I'm nervous about being in this, but, I think if a deal is made, it'll go up. \n\n\n**BABA:**\nEverybody knows Baba. Everybdy knows what they do. Everybody knows they have shady books...but they're still a monster in China and always looking to expand within and outside of china\n\n**TCEHY**\nlthough they seem to be getting hammered more by the Chinese Govt themselves now, Tencent still owns gaming and the largest messenger / payments platform in China. In China, you QQ is not just a messaging app, its a necessary platform for most people in China. The company is still growing at a healthy pace (despite the obvious setbacks) and continues to invest in various other businesses\n\n**HUYA**\nI think it should now be undeniable that eSports is one of the \"next big things\" and that China is at the head of that. Company recently reports, and all KPIs are up, the company is profitable and based on my LIMITED usage of the platform, they haven't even started to really tap into many of the monetization methods that Twitch already uses. Add in the Tencent investment, and the desire of the company (based on their conference call) to keep expanding as rapidly as they have, and this could be a big one. It's very volatile, and can shoot up (or down) on some news, or no news. Case in point, earnings came out last night, and it shot up 10%, only to close the day barely up. \n\n\n**IQ** \nFirmly believe, if this were a US company, it would be trading much higher. It's often called the netflix of China. While similar it's different. They allow users to stream content for free with advertising, or watch premium shows / no ads, with a paid subscription. They're growing rapidly, and based on their numbers, its not unrealistic to think they could be at 120-150 million paid subs in the next 12 to 18 months. Their challenge is that they're not yet profitable as they're investing a lot in content (just like netflix, but WITHOUT the such a heavy reliance on debt). Management has mentioned  they're not opposed to increasing prices, but for now their focus is on growth. Given the competition they face from QQ video (Tencent owned), this is definitely understandable. From what I've read however, IQ, is pulling ahead in terms of original content and perceived content value as they focus more on original content while QQ seems to focus more licensed content.
