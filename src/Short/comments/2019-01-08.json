Maybe the actual results of Phase II missed expectations. Maybe the drug is more costly to produce than anticipated. Maybe PAR expenses were larger than expected.

So if i buy apple stocks on monday, sell it 1 hour later and buy and sell apple stocks again on the same day it will count as 2 day trading?\n\n2. if i buy apple stocks and samsung stocks on monday and sell both on the same day, will it count as 1 or 2?\n\n3.
