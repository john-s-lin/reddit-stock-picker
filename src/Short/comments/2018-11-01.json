They are going to keep growing exponentially for quite a few years and I'm pretty sure they're at least going to be as big as the biggest manufacturers. Filling the demand for the full range of regular cars, roadsters, semi trucks...\n\nAlso consider they do direct delivery, aiming for 7 days from factory to customer. This eliminates a huge drain on the profit margin that the competition loses to dealerships keeping lots of cars in their halls.\n\nThey also don't spend much on marketing, so far they're getting more demand than they can supply by word of mouth and news reporting. This may change as the market start getting saturated, but I think that's gonna be a few years yet. They're gonna be busy just building more factories to keep up with the flood of orders.\n\nThen we have some really big possibilities that are a bit more uncertain. The house and large scale batteries, how big is that going to be. There's a huge market for power storage solutions as we adopt wind and solar that swings up and down in production over the day and to eliminate the need for a lot of peaker plants. House batteries is likely to grow into an enormous market as well as people open their eyes to the possibilities of cost savings and being less reliant on the grid.\n\nThen they have the solar roof coming at some point. Not sure if that's going to be a huge hit or just a novelty. If it's a hit, there's a leading product with a huge market.\n\nAlso they make the best car battery packs, if the competition decides to go with Tesla as supplier for that, then we have a Tesla that sells as many cars as any competing company as well as selling a lot of batteries to the competition.\n\nSo put all that together and try to estimate how big they could become. I don't know the time it's gonna take, but they're growing damn fast.

However, literally everyone is working on this, even companies that aren't car companies. 5-10 years down the road this will not be an advantage unless they are able to be massively innovative.\n\n2.) They are clearly the leader in electric cars. But again, this isn't a big moat. All major car companies are working on electric cars and have more resources than Tesla. Again, they will need to remain innovative to stay in the lead.\n\n\nI think that under Elon's direction they can certainly remain innovative and push forward as a leader in the electric car industry.

If you believe that autonomous driving is right around the corner and believe that the current incumbents lack the means to get there, then Tesla makes a lot of sense. I think that Tesla's plans\u2014letting buyers send their cars out to earn money while they don't use them\u2014makes more sense than Uber's plan of buying and needing to maintain potentially hundreds of millions of cars worldwide.\n\nThere are a ton of short to mid-term reasons why I wouldn't personally bet on the company. The debt concerns and Tesla's ability to produce are big deals, and while Musk will never admit it, the reason why Tesla doesn't have model years for their cars is because they can't afford to actually redesign any of their cars with any regularity.\n\nIronically, the thing that helped sustain Tesla to where it is now\u2014government desire for alternative energy cars\u2014may also be its demise as governments the world over incentivize automakers to produce electric vehicles.

Facebook isn't invading people's privacy any more than Google or Amazon are.\n\n2) The picture you are painting (squeezing every bit of short term profit, stopped caring about its userbase, platform full of ads) is untrue. In several earning report calls this year they have stated they are going to tone down the number of ads, rework the newsfeed to show more relevant content, increase the investment in security, etc etc. Zuckerberg has gone on the record to tell investors to expect a decrease in profit margins as they invest *less* in squeezing money and more in reinforcing the future of the platform. That doesn't sound to me like a company that doesn't give shit about anything and is all about profits. But, of course, you wouldn't know that if you paid attention exclusively to what the media is reporting, since they are exaggerating everything for clicks and views, see 1)\n\n3) Facebook properties together have 2 billion daily active users as of last month this year. That is *insane*. Never in the (admittedly short) history of the internet has a competitor been able to displace a company with billions of active users. It would be akin to compete with Google on search, not impossible, but good luck with that.\n\n4) Instagram and WhatsApp show fantastic promise in the near term future and are examples of the excellent management this company has; these products are thriving despite being acquisitions. Yahoo, for example, had a history of acquiring companies only to have them die due to mismanagement. That ain't happening here, and that's a good signal.\n\n5) Heavy investment in Oculus and VR shows Facebook isn't afraid of thinking in the long term future and taking riskier bets even if they don't pay profits right away. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying he believes it will take a *decade* for mainstream VR to take off. That they are thinking in terms of decades and taking long roads shows to me that they have the right mentality to succeed in tech.", "score": 27, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 249, "submission_ratio": 0.10843373493975904, "submission_title": "Why do people feel so comfortable holding FB long-term?", "submission_text": "More than willing to accept I'm wrong on this, and if it isn't obvious, I am pretty biased against FB because I personally hate the company, but I'd like to keep this discussion objective.\n\nI don't see how people think Facebook will stay relevant long-term.\n\nOther big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have an established product/service that would be very hard to recreate.

No one is able to offer the targeting and scalability of Facebook/IG except maybe Google (Search & YT). This is due to the nature of the platforms. While Google has people actively searching for something, and sells advertisers on that, Facebook/IG is by its very nature a platform where people divulge shit tons of personal information - their age, their likes, their dislikes. We follow brands, companies, other people, influencers etc.. For that reason, FB offers the best targeting capabilities of any company.\n3. Scalability - No one offers advertisers more scalability than FB and Google. You can spend $30 a month, or $30M.

Mind you - that\u2019s all before tariffs kick in + margins before $15 min wage. Netflix - $10B issuer of debt, barely profitable. Literally, barely profitable. Sure tariffs won\u2019t hurt them, sure they dominate the consumer demand for movies @ without (too) much competition (i.e Roku, Hulu, Amazon TV) - but with $550M in NET income, compared to what, 5%+ on junk bond rates debt? You do the math & tell me how a PE ratio above 100 is attractive lol. Apple - Not bearish, not crazy bullish. The 2% decline in cash flow obviously attributed to the reason they\u2019ve been able to stay afloat while the market has tumbled. Google - Semi bullish just because they\u2019re as financially stable as Facebook (lil more obviously, but, you know). Facebook, forget the hacks, the \u201cgrowth\u201d worries (is Apple a \u201cgrowth\u201d or a value play? If you picked \u201cgrowth\u201d - feel free to explain why they\u2019d take iPhone + Mac unit sales out of quarterly reports). The fucking margins on this bitch, 80%? They literally are a gem in the dirt. No other company whether it\u2019s sales force or Factset or Workday, Adobe, Microsoft, etc - produces the profitability that Facebook does. I could care less if the bitch sank to $120 - because THAT is a discount every bull that\u2019d rush to buy Amazon doesn\u2019t understand. I won\u2019t even talk dumb shit about growth prospects - all I\u2019m saying is if they do plan on being as big as YT or Alibaba with FB marketplace or whatever tf they plan on doing - they\u2019re doing it with a big dick of margin that ejaculates free cash flow. All without debt. SOMEONE LOOK AT THE MINISCULE AMOUNT OF DEBT A TECH COMPANY HAS COMPARED TO THEIR STRAIGHT ASS PROFITS - ITS NUTS, PREPOSTEROUS, INSANITY, THERE IS NO OTHER TECH COMPANY LIKE FACEBOOK LMAO.

They are extremely savvy and have executed better than any company in the world in my opinion as they\u2019ve navigated every twist and turn transitioning from the web to mobile. They spotted trends way before anyone else and continue to do so. When they bought Instagram for a billion I thought it was completely idiotic. Then $19 billion for WhatsApp. But now it makes sense. They want to own your free time on your phone. Any trend away from spending time on the Facebook ecosystem they will attack head on.\n\nLast point- it\u2019s not only the user platform that would be very difficult to replicate it\u2019s the advertising platform. They\u2019ve essentially built a system for advertisers to leverage and measure ads to over 2 billion people in one place. The value of that is immeasurable. The market is scared because it\u2019s not sure they will be able to grow revenue by having people view more video and personalized content than spending time on the newsfeed. I think this is the wrong way to look at it. They are smartly realizing that the important thing is to keep people coming back and spending as much time on the platform and then figuring out how to monetize it. They spelled this out in no uncertain terms on the call on Tuesday. If they simply ignored where users are demonstrably spending more time then they are practically inviting another company to eat their lunch.

Like one of the poorest countries in the world poor, in Africa. \n\nI once went to an extremely rural area. A tiny town in the middle of nowhere. This town is literally several hundred miles from anything that even resembles a city as you know it, and is nestled between a jungle and a Savannah. \n\nThe people in this area drink their water from rivers and lakes. Few, if any of them have actual toilet seats in their homes. They heard animals. Most are farmers. \n\nWhile there, I went for a long walk one day. On this walk I caught the attention of a few boys. They followed me and started talking to me. These boys literally had nothing in their lives. No toys, no fancy clothes. Some of them weren\u2019t even wearing shoes. We talked and they told me about their lives. \n\nWhen we were ready to part ways, almost all of the boys took out a piece of small paper and wrote their names on it. They gave me the pieces of paper with their names on it.

Facebook isn't invading people's privacy any more than Google or Amazon are.\n\n2) The picture you are painting (squeezing every bit of short term profit, stopped caring about its userbase, platform full of ads) is untrue. In several earning report calls this year they have stated they are going to tone down the number of ads, rework the newsfeed to show more relevant content, increase the investment in security, etc etc. Zuckerberg has gone on the record to tell investors to expect a decrease in profit margins as they invest *less* in squeezing money and more in reinforcing the future of the platform. That doesn't sound to me like a company that doesn't give shit about anything and is all about profits. But, of course, you wouldn't know that if you paid attention exclusively to what the media is reporting, since they are exaggerating everything for clicks and views, see 1)\n\n3) Facebook properties together have 2 billion daily active users as of last month this year. That is *insane*. Never in the (admittedly short) history of the internet has a competitor been able to displace a company with billions of active users. It would be akin to compete with Google on search, not impossible, but good luck with that.\n\n4) Instagram and WhatsApp show fantastic promise in the near term future and are examples of the excellent management this company has; these products are thriving despite being acquisitions. Yahoo, for example, had a history of acquiring companies only to have them die due to mismanagement. That ain't happening here, and that's a good signal.\n\n5) Heavy investment in Oculus and VR shows Facebook isn't afraid of thinking in the long term future and taking riskier bets even if they don't pay profits right away. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying he believes it will take a *decade* for mainstream VR to take off. That they are thinking in terms of decades and taking long roads shows to me that they have the right mentality to succeed in tech.", "parent_score": 27, "parent_ratio": 0.2222222222222222}, {"time": 1541101871.0, "submission_id": "9tb027", "comment_id": "e8v9z90", "body": "How do you make money from WhatsApp?

Through the internet. What are efficient ways to reach them? Through Google's suite and Facebook's suite. The two make up 75% of online advertising revenue and that is an industry that is rapidly growing with it's innovative ways of finding and appealing to certain demographics. \n\nNot only that, but they have yet monetized Instagram and WhatsApp to its full potential. If you listened to FB's earning report this week, you'd know that the company has a lot of opportunities to make a lot more money.\n\nSpeaking of money, even with recent security upgrades, the company boasts some of the best margins in the industry. On top of that, they have 0 debt. Yes, you heard me correct - NONE. So as they print money, they can literally buy or fund whatever venture they want to go down.\n\nAnd above all, 2.2 Billion people use their offering every month. So while you equate facebook.com to simply a site of the past as friends don't really use it anymore, the vast majority of the world see facebook as a way to connect with their community online. You'd be surprised that the rest of this world has yet fully utilized the internet. \n\n\nSo, to answer your question, you are completely misguided in your anecdotal essay of how \"weak\" Facebook is.

Sure tariffs won\u2019t hurt them, sure they dominate the consumer demand for movies @ without (too) much competition (i.e Roku, Hulu, Amazon TV) - but with $550M in NET income, compared to what, 5%+ on junk bond rates debt? You do the math & tell me how a PE ratio above 100 is attractive lol. Apple - Not bearish, not crazy bullish. The 2% decline in cash flow obviously attributed to the reason they\u2019ve been able to stay afloat while the market has tumbled. Google - Semi bullish just because they\u2019re as financially stable as Facebook (lil more obviously, but, you know). Facebook, forget the hacks, the \u201cgrowth\u201d worries (is Apple a \u201cgrowth\u201d or a value play?

There are two ways to do this. A stop order or a stop limit order. A stop order will execute when the price goes to your designated price. In your case 100. Then it will guarantee an execution of a sell at the best possible market price. This could be 100 or 99 or whatever lower price the market dictates. Remember it\u2019s a market order and as such subject to what the market is willing to pay for it. A stop limit order is the same as above but instead of selling at whatever the market states it\u2019s worth, you can specify a certain lower limit. Say you set that at 99 in your example.
