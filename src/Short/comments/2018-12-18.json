To simplify, as the near maturity expires, the VXX manager sells the near maturity and buys the next nearest maturity. On average, further dated VIX futures are more expensive than near term futures.\n\nFor the VXX to rise consistently in the long-run, the VIX futures curve will have to be downward sloping. This is guaranteed to not happen because on average the far future is more uncertain than the near future.\n\nYou may be wondering then, why not short VIX futures (or the VXX ETF), or go long an inverse VIX ETF? The answer is that in the short-term VIX can rise more than 100%, and if you are short, you lose all your capital marked for that trade.

That said, here is my opinion on the 3 as someone who doesn't own them (except for a single token share).\n\nNFLX has a lot of new competition entering its space in 2019.  Who knows how the streaming war will end.  AT&T own the 5g line (can bundle mobile subs with streaming subs), no net neutrality so can throttle competitors on their network if they wanted, and have a huge catalog of popular shows and currently amazing HBO titles.  It would take someone of super levels of incompetence for AT&T to not start eating some of that market share.  Disney... Marvel... Star Wars... Fox 20th Century.... only someone inbred could stop that streaming service from gaining market share.  I don't own any of the above, but I only watch HBO original series (WestWorld / GoT - ya know, like everyone else).\n\nAMZN probably still has a long long way to go.  I'd bet eventually they'll be broken up due to anti-trust laws.... so owning them would be fantastic for that event!  Never owned any of their shares though, I thought an online book store was a stupid ass idea in 2000... and I was right.... but then they stopped selling books and started selling everything worth a shit.  Tough miss on that one.\n\nAAPL hmmm.  Cult like following from consumers despite inferior products (in terms of hardware - not design).  I wonder if that is a fad that will likely continue forever... I see a lot of \"older\" folks with apple products... and we all know that once \"older\" folks get on the band wagon, that's when the cool factor ends.  Lower sales, higher prices, older owners...
