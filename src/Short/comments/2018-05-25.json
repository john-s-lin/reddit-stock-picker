They also do some tutoring, elder care, and college prep stuff too. I mentioned them on here not that long ago to see everyone\u2019s opinions and had some good discussion and mixed reviews. I haven\u2019t been holding them myself very long (actually just under 2 weeks) but they have made some real steady gains over the last few years and I think will continue to do so. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stock that will give you crazy high returns but instead a company that will pay off for the patient holder with smaller, milder yet consistent growth that adds up when looking at the big picture over time.\n\nMy best earner this year if I were to sell would be by far Omeros Corp which is a biotech/pharm stock. It has experienced all the typical ups and downs that many of these companies face (including a real rough patch late 2017/start of this year) but has recovered and been moving in the right direction. I\u2019m proud to say I got in during a really good time with this one and also had some luck on my side as well. I\u2019m very optimistic about this company and think it will pay off well for me. My only concern would be for anyone getting in now. While I still think the potential for growth and solid returns is still there with this company, I think the chance for big time returns have mostly passed. A lot is riding on approval of one their pipeline drugs that is in stage 3 trials and showing great promise. If it passes, the stock should do very well and more than double than its current price based on how companies of similar size and with similar products have.

They also do some tutoring, elder care, and college prep stuff too. I mentioned them on here not that long ago to see everyone\u2019s opinions and had some good discussion and mixed reviews. I haven\u2019t been holding them myself very long (actually just under 2 weeks) but they have made some real steady gains over the last few years and I think will continue to do so. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stock that will give you crazy high returns but instead a company that will pay off for the patient holder with smaller, milder yet consistent growth that adds up when looking at the big picture over time.\n\nMy best earner this year if I were to sell would be by far Omeros Corp which is a biotech/pharm stock. It has experienced all the typical ups and downs that many of these companies face (including a real rough patch late 2017/start of this year) but has recovered and been moving in the right direction. I\u2019m proud to say I got in during a really good time with this one and also had some luck on my side as well. I\u2019m very optimistic about this company and think it will pay off well for me. My only concern would be for anyone getting in now. While I still think the potential for growth and solid returns is still there with this company, I think the chance for big time returns have mostly passed. A lot is riding on approval of one their pipeline drugs that is in stage 3 trials and showing great promise. If it passes, the stock should do very well and more than double than its current price based on how companies of similar size and with similar products have.
