Even our legendary investors are only right 50% of the time at best but it turns out that you only have to win once. \n\nSo...\n\n>Don't buy stocks based on reddit or what your buddies are talking about. Do your DD, and trust your judgement based on the facts you've learned.\n\nYou absolutely *should* buy stocks and derivatives based on what everyone is saying because everyone moves in the same direction. You just buy in the opposite direction is all. This is the game called \"Options\" for most.\n\n>Buy or enter a position when the price is below your valuation. Maybe the market had a bad day or there's garbage news floating around. \n\nSince there's no concrete method to actually getting a valuation there's no rational way to actually pick when something is good or bad because your valuation might be total shit. The entire game of trading is based on the idea that everyone's valuation is different.\n\n>Don't catch falling knives.\n\nIf it's below your valuation it's a falling knife. You would literally never buy anything less than what you'd expect. Instead of worrying about falling knives you should worry about longevity; if a company is clearly dying then it's dying, it isn't if its going to not die, and no amount of innovation is going to change that. The risk is when players abandon \"When\" for \"Why\" because it doesn't matter why, just when.\n\n>History does repeat itself. So do businesses, and people. Take that how you will.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't true at all. The gambler who plays in hindsight loses all of his foresight. While there are major cycles of debt that cannot be predictable for individual level entities whether it be companies or people; a trend mistaken for a path is exactly why so many people lose so much money in this game.\n\n>Hivemind is very real when it comes to the market.\n\nWhich is ironically a very hiveminded statement. This is actually not true. Remember how I said the basis of trading is that everyone has a different valuation? This means that there is no real hivemind, there are opinions that flow in the same direction, but it is erroneous to mistake that for an actual collective consideration. I like to think of it as flowing water rather than sliding ice, if you catch my drift.\n\n>There are trends people create. Use that to your advantage, and once in a blue moon, it makes sense to bet against people. \n\nNo, it always makes sense to bet against other people, and trending news is a wonderful thing but unfortunately most of the moeny doesn't lie in trends. Those tiny companies that are growing tend to be micro in the news; while most investors wait until a stock becomes a household name the smart investor digs into a giant book and reads and reads and reads about things no one knows exists. Point per point you'll make more money at XYZPDQ than you will at Amazon at this point. \n\n>Everything is priced in. Always. \n\nI strongly disagree. Why? Because the problem of the trading game. If everything is priced in, and it isn't, then why is it that you and I have different valuations? \"Well, we value the information differently, duh.\" one might respond but that man is an idiot and we all know it. None of us here is willing to pay $1,000 for a basic colgate toothbrush you can get for $2, no? Now that is information that is priced in. But for a stock? There are no shelves and certainly no suggested prices and you're playing a game of kings betting on the future.\n\nThe one thing that isn't built into the price is you. And you are the one thing I need to beat at this game. Well you and everyone else trading. I need someone to sell to me at a price they think is too much and I need to sell it to some sucker at a price I think is just right for me to gain a little capital but not worth waiting for to go up any further.\n\n>Time in is always more important than trying to time your entrance because you can't predict volatility.\n\nThis is counterintuitive. Time is way worse and volatility is your friend because if you're buying below your valuation your entire goal is to see some kind of turnover. The more rapid the turnover the better off you are. Money today is worth more than money tomorrow, after all, so your entire strategy should be about literally grabbing all those falling knives by the handle and throwing them into some sucker's chest riding on volatility with the knowledge that you're not priced in and that sucker is basing his valuations on practically nothing meaningful.\n\nTo win this game you need to really pick where your money is going to come from, paper gains or upfront realized?\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 259, "submission_ratio": 0.007722007722007722, "submission_title": "Rules I've learned to go by...", "submission_text": "- Don't buy stocks based on reddit or what your buddies are talking about.

I currently have most of my portfolio in broad index funds and am looking for the best way to add some leverage while keeping my asset allocation roughly the same. My time horizon is 25+ years. Right now, I\u2019m looking at these 3 methods of doing this and would like some feedback and risk/reward comparison among the options. If there are other, better, ways of executing this strategy I would like to hear those too. \n\n1.\tLeveraged index ETF\u2019s \u2013 This would be stuff like UPRO (which I currently hold). This seems like the most set-it-and-forget-it and least risky of the options. I do realize that the daily rebalancing means it could underperform the S&P even if the S&P goes up, but I feel the risk of this is low assuming the S&P sees moderate long-term growth.\n2.\tBuy index funds with margin \u2013 This is probably my least favorite idea because it can\u2019t be done in retirement accounts, but I really don\u2019t know much about margin so I\u2019d be interested to hear pros and cons vs the other options.\n3.\tIndex fund LEAPS \u2013 This seems like the highest risk and highest reward of the options but also the one that requires the most work and some sort of strategy. I\u2019m pretty new to options too (only bought a few bull call spreads on SPY). What would be the most straightforward way to do this? Could I just buy them on a monthly/quarterly basis as far into the future as I can, hold to expiration, and re-invest the proceeds when they expire (basically a LEAPS ladder)?", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 130, "submission_ratio": 0.023076923076923078, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread June 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

I have picked some great stocks over the last year that i have not held just traded because didn't want to lose. now that i am in a better spot and this money is not all i have it is easier to hold now. I want to pretty much pick 10 stocks to add to this. The ETFs i hold are mostly because they are heavily weighted to the stocks i like  AMZN, ADBE, MSFT, MU, NVDA, AMD, FSLR, GOOG, BABA, BA, LMT to name a few. which wish i just held over the past 2 years they all ended up being winners. my risk avoidance hurt me so i am looking to transition out of 80&#37; ETF and have a more balanced ETF Stocks and let it sit for awhile.  I am always at the computer for work so i tend to look at market stuff more than i should.   Any thoughts are appreciated. \nEdit:  I also occasionally play with options but nothing major like 1-3% with ITM puts or options with enough time to make a move just trying to capitalize on the swings.

Just recently I made some changes to my portfolio (as reflected above) to try to supercharge it a bit.\n\nI am a firm believer in index funds. Up until my recent lineup, index funds were 42% of my portfolio. They were equally distributed between VOO, IVOO and VIOO. When I rebalanced my portfolio in the last couple of weeks, I heavily weighted small caps (VIOO). I moved my large cap into growth mode (VOOG), and I eliminated mid caps.\n\nThe mid cap elimination weighed on me heavily. The thing is, I want a bit more risk/reward from my portfolio, so I had to cut something in order to pay for a new position. Everything in me screams not to cut an index fund, but what else am I going to sell? V? HD? AAPL? I don't think so. Those bad boys have served me well.\n\nSo, I cut the mid cap index to go riskier. I really like $SQ, but I feel there are a ton of pitfalls they will have to maneuver to gain dominance, and I don't see a moat yet. I ended up going with MELI. I've lived in Latin America and MELI is the best game in town, far and away. The Americas are a rapidly growing market with very little e-commerce penetration. MELI is a combo AMZN, EBAY and SQ all in one. Bottom line - I have a lot of faith in MELI long term.\n\nSo, if you would, let me know what you think about my current lineup. Also, can you assuage my fears of trimming down my index funds? Or, maybe not? Tell me why buying MELI to replace midcaps was dumb.\n\nOh - cash. I try to keep a cash reserve as \"dry powder\". Many people quote me stuff about \"scared money doesn't make money\", but I love to buy a stock when there is blood in the streets and swing it. Equifax and FB is a prime example. I bought at their temporary valleys and sold within weeks.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and effort.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 130, "submission_ratio": 0.007692307692307693, "submission_title": "Rate My Portfolio - r/Stocks Quarterly Thread June 2018", "submission_text": "Please use this thread to discuss your portfolio, learn of other stock tickers, and help out users by giving constructive criticism.\n\nWhy quarterly?

I used Robinhood, but only the most basic buy and sell functions. I have a employer-provided 401K I pay into. My portfolio is largely tech/media related. I must be enjoying some beginner's luck, as I'm up a total of $6,500+ in about 4 months for a total growth of 14.5%\n\nWWE 255 shares 27.20%\n\nULTA 10 shares 3%\n\nDIS 100 shares 14%\n\nSHAK 100 shares 7.37%\n\nSKIS 200 shares 1.29%\n\nNfLX 10 shares 4.61%\n\nTTWO 100 shares 17.41%\n\nAMZN 10 shares 24.90%\n\n\u200b\n\nWWE and Amazon are my big winners that largely carry that portfolio. Shake Shack, Netflix, and Take Two have provided volatile, though TakeTwo is currently performing well and Netflix has rebounded slightly above the price where I bought in. I was considering ditching SKIS because it moves around a lot but without a meaningful trend. Additionally, I might try to unload ULTA at some point since I have a low position and it hasn't performed well for me.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm interested in potentially putting another $5-10K into either increasing positions or buying a stake in either something in the food and beverage industry or cannabis-related. Would love some recs and ideas there. On the food side, I was briefly interested in Nathan's and Wing Stop because I think they're doing some big things with franchising. Also interested in Adidas.\n\nAdditionally, should I be using Limits or some other tactic to reduce risk of potential loss?

Right now, I\u2019m looking at these 3 methods of doing this and would like some feedback and risk/reward comparison among the options. If there are other, better, ways of executing this strategy I would like to hear those too. \n\n1.\tLeveraged index ETF\u2019s \u2013 This would be stuff like UPRO (which I currently hold). This seems like the most set-it-and-forget-it and least risky of the options. I do realize that the daily rebalancing means it could underperform the S&P even if the S&P goes up, but I feel the risk of this is low assuming the S&P sees moderate long-term growth.\n2.\tBuy index funds with margin \u2013 This is probably my least favorite idea because it can\u2019t be done in retirement accounts, but I really don\u2019t know much about margin so I\u2019d be interested to hear pros and cons vs the other options.\n3.\tIndex fund LEAPS \u2013 This seems like the highest risk and highest reward of the options but also the one that requires the most work and some sort of strategy. I\u2019m pretty new to options too (only bought a few bull call spreads on SPY). What would be the most straightforward way to do this?

Just recently I made some changes to my portfolio (as reflected above) to try to supercharge it a bit.\n\nI am a firm believer in index funds. Up until my recent lineup, index funds were 42% of my portfolio. They were equally distributed between VOO, IVOO and VIOO. When I rebalanced my portfolio in the last couple of weeks, I heavily weighted small caps (VIOO). I moved my large cap into growth mode (VOOG), and I eliminated mid caps.\n\nThe mid cap elimination weighed on me heavily. The thing is, I want a bit more risk/reward from my portfolio, so I had to cut something in order to pay for a new position. Everything in me screams not to cut an index fund, but what else am I going to sell? V? HD? AAPL? I don't think so. Those bad boys have served me well.\n\nSo, I cut the mid cap index to go riskier. I really like $SQ, but I feel there are a ton of pitfalls they will have to maneuver to gain dominance, and I don't see a moat yet. I ended up going with MELI. I've lived in Latin America and MELI is the best game in town, far and away. The Americas are a rapidly growing market with very little e-commerce penetration. MELI is a combo AMZN, EBAY and SQ all in one. Bottom line - I have a lot of faith in MELI long term.\n\nSo, if you would, let me know what you think about my current lineup. Also, can you assuage my fears of trimming down my index funds? Or, maybe not? Tell me why buying MELI to replace midcaps was dumb.\n\nOh - cash. I try to keep a cash reserve as \"dry powder\". Many people quote me stuff about \"scared money doesn't make money\", but I love to buy a stock when there is blood in the streets and swing it. Equifax and FB is a prime example.

Additionally, I might try to unload ULTA at some point since I have a low position and it hasn't performed well for me.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm interested in potentially putting another $5-10K into either increasing positions or buying a stake in either something in the food and beverage industry or cannabis-related. Would love some recs and ideas there. On the food side, I was briefly interested in Nathan's and Wing Stop because I think they're doing some big things with franchising.

Winners tend to keep winning, losers the same. I bought NVDA at $22/share and later at $24/share a few years back for a total of around $16k. Shot up to the mid $60s/share and I \u201ctrimmed\u201d quite a bit based on this advice and now it\u2019s $250/share. All you need out of a portfolio of 10-15 stocks is to have one real big winner and it can make up for all the rest. I\u2019m a buy and hold long term investor and now I almost never sell and I certainly don\u2019t sell my winners. \n\nAll that being said, while I do invest to try to make the most money I can, I also get enjoyment from reading up on companies and stocks (it\u2019s like sports). If someone is starting out (or even experienced and wants to make money), probably the best long term strategy is to buy S&P index funds (VOO is a GREAT etf) every month or paycheck rain or shine, up or down, for the next 10-30 years. Your gains will almost certainly be higher than the vast majority of amateur and professional investors that try to beat the market/S&P though more complex approaches. The problem for me is that even with this knowledge I still buy individual stocks over VOO (though I do have a lot of VOO) because of the thrill of the sport. But, to make my earlier point, if I would\u2019ve kept my $16k of NVDA at around $22 - $24/share, it would\u2019ve been over $150k by now. Not enough to retire or anything but certainly a leg up on getting there. Same happened with Netflix which I had before the stock split. \n\nAnyway, think twice before \u201ctrimming\u201d a winner.

What fundamental misunderstanding do I have about options?\n\n2. The two pieces of advice I have given you hold true for all stocks, not just your picks and not just mine.\n\n3. My historical return does not tell you what return I\u2019m happy with. First off that\u2019s return on total contributions, so when I put $1,000 I\u2019m in December that effects my calculations the same as if I put that in the previous January, but it only has 1 month to make money.\n\nWhat I just sent you is in fact a growth portfolio, I\u2019m hoping for much more than a 13% return annually. \n\nThe advice I originally gave you was this: 10% of your portfolio in long call options is gambling. You since clarified that you are using proper option spreads, and I have made no criticism about that. \n\nMy second piece of advice was that stock price does not tell you anything about growth potential. I\u2019ll build off of that here, what you should be looking at is market cap. Check out some of my picks at the beginning of that list, LAD for example. There is a stock with great growth potential, despite the fact it is trading at close to $100 per share. This is an example of a stock with a high price, and also high growth potential. The key is market cap. A 2.5B dollar company could turn into a 25B dollar company a lot easier than a 50B company could turn into a 500B company. Take a look at ATVI, it\u2019s trading at less per share, but it does not have the potential to be a 10-bagger the same way stocks like LAD do.\n\nYou are on the right track, you just need to put your ego aside and try to think \u201chow is this person trying to help me\u201d rather than \u201cwhy is this person wrong\u201d.

The first is that when you are a value investor (or a growth investor, though to a much, much lesser extent) your proposition is that you want to buy a company that is undervalued. So that's the part that everyone understands. The part that is missing is that you want to buy a *substantial* part of that company because if you have a major holding you get profit-share directly and it isn't just paper-gains. The idea that is while you are waiting for the market to appreciate the actual value of the stock you also are making real-time money not just on perks like dividends but actual profits from the company itself.\n\nThe other portion that people are missing is that you need to be able to buy at a price that is specifically *below market*. When I say that I mean it actually has to be below whatever the market is trading at which requires a huge amount of volume for the deal. You basically have to name your own price.\n\nIf you look up most value investors they are almost all institutional for this reason. You have to have some form of major cashflow in order to sustain the waiting game. Furthermore you need huge volumes of the stuff to make it worth your while and if you're not profit sharing and don't have a large enough stake generally speaking you're actually *losing* money over time because your gains almost always paper gains so until you actually realize them they stay that way meaning that your buying power over time using current funds diminishes year over year preventing you from making larger and more profitable acquisitions. \n\nThat's why people need to read Security Analysis and also why the general investor should just Index.

The first is that when you are a value investor (or a growth investor, though to a much, much lesser extent) your proposition is that you want to buy a company that is undervalued. So that's the part that everyone understands. The part that is missing is that you want to buy a *substantial* part of that company because if you have a major holding you get profit-share directly and it isn't just paper-gains. The idea that is while you are waiting for the market to appreciate the actual value of the stock you also are making real-time money not just on perks like dividends but actual profits from the company itself.\n\nThe other portion that people are missing is that you need to be able to buy at a price that is specifically *below market*. When I say that I mean it actually has to be below whatever the market is trading at which requires a huge amount of volume for the deal. You basically have to name your own price.\n\nIf you look up most value investors they are almost all institutional for this reason. You have to have some form of major cashflow in order to sustain the waiting game. Furthermore you need huge volumes of the stuff to make it worth your while and if you're not profit sharing and don't have a large enough stake generally speaking you're actually *losing* money over time because your gains almost always paper gains so until you actually realize them they stay that way meaning that your buying power over time using current funds diminishes year over year preventing you from making larger and more profitable acquisitions. \n\nThat's why people need to read Security Analysis and also why the general investor should just Index. Growth and Value investing are majorly institutional strategies because you just need so much capital to really deploy them well.

Berkshire likely has the same arrangement with companies that do *not* produce a dividend as well.\n\nThe buying below market is required because of volume. You won't make the money back immediately which means that your funds are functionally suppressed during that time making it very difficult because the fact that it is undervalued also means that you're turning your dollar into that value. So let's say you see a stock that you believe is worth 10 but trading at 6?
