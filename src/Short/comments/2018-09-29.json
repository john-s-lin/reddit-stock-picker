They serve pizza, and are judgement free, so people don't feel bad about being over weight. They said somewhere, that their main competition is KFC, or something along those lines.  They have shot up in the past year, but they aren't doing too bad. Their revenue and profit margins have grown pretty well too. They will probably plateau here soon, but they are expanding. \nDuring the last earnings call they mentioned adding a \"wearable\" to track fitness and things like that. I have a feeling they will invest in that coming up. In my opinion wearables have a short shelf life and usually the best they do is blow up with hype and die out. So im not confident that will realistically bring in tons of income for them. They mentioned they don't plan on raising prices for the short term, which is currently at 21.99$/mo for their \"Black Card\" and something like 9.99$ for their basic package. \n\nAll in all, I've hopped in and out of PLNT stock. Gyms historically are dangerous businesses, but i think they have cornered a niche market, and have been crushing it. Pretty good pops after the last 7 or so earnings, and have beat earnings out of something like the last 7/8 earnings calls. \n\nI'd say they have some juice in the tank to keep expanding and growing. Maybe 60$ to 65$ by end of year. \n\nI'm by no means a financial advisor or anything like that. Just a dude who researched some stocks that I as a consumer use. This happened to be my gym.

This only worked because I am military so because of the Servicemember's Civil Relief Act, my interest rate was capped at 4% through my bank for a year after I deployed (6% is the where they legally have to cap it, my bank just goes a little bit further on that).  It paid off well and I ended up making about 4k and paid about 1.4k in interest by the time my card was paid off.  Now, the way you may want to emulate this if that is the path you want to go down, is find a card with low or no balance transfer fee, and is interest free for 15 months, transfer your debt to that card and then you can make it work.
