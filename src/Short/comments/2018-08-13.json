That was the whole crux of the matter and why it was so bad.  \n\nUnlike financial experts, economists have little incentive to lie.

The market was making headlines for the all time highs weekly.   The news was pretty excited.  \n\nBut you have to remember that the market peaked in late 2007.  The crash hit portfolios before people started calling it a recession.  By the time people started getting anxious and understood exactly what was going on, we were well into 2008 and you would have already lost 30%.   Very few people were making this bet in 2007, but I told my dad in the summer of 2007 that he should sell everything.  I was a dumb kid and didn't understand what that meant at the time but I could just sense an irrational exuberance in the headlines.  \n\nAnother thing you have to understand is that 2007 was failure of the financial system.  Which means economists weren't involved because the financial sector was covering up the problem.  That was the whole crux of the matter and why it was so bad.  \n\nUnlike financial experts, economists have little incentive to lie.  I tend to agree with their outlook and the issues that these economists are using to forecast aren't going away.  That of course means that this will not be like last time.  People are forewarned, and theoretically the blow should not come so hard.  But I do think we will see prolonged stagnation that will be just as damaging or even worse than 2007 and again, you won't know for sure until we're well into it.  \n\nPersonally, I think nominal losses will be minimal this time around and most of the loss will come from rampant inflation, similar to the 1970s.

A lot of your actions seem inherently contradictory to your goal of low risk, slow growth. I'm gunna break my advice down into 2 categories: picking stocks, and macro investing strategies. \n\nLets start with investing strategy: \n\n\\- Assuming that you are planning to have this money invested for 3-5-10 years (thinking long term), you need to start to train your self to buy and forget. You should rethink/rebalance your portfolio MAYBE once or twice a year but ideally, if you put in your work initially, you shouldnt have to do much tinkering. So, unless your trading, your conclusion that you shouldn't buy or hold through an ER seems pretty incorrect to me. \n\n\\- There is top down investing and bottom up investing (look it up if you don't know already). For top down strategies, ERs should be pretty irrelevant except for maybe when you are trying to find a good entry/exit point. For bottom up strategies, it could be more relevant, but even then you are going to have to hold your stock through an ER. \n\n\\- Sometimes selling your losers is the right thing to do. But, you shouldnt just sell because its losing, you should sell because you realize that you made a fundamental miscalculation or the market has somehow shifted (china trade shit showing up out of nowhere, for example). \n\n\\- If you are new to investing, I would recommend not taking a highly active hand with your portfolio. Most will agree that time in the market will yield returns...start with that and then once you become more experienced, slowly start to manage your positions a bit more. Generally tho, it sounds like you have been trading which is an entirely different ballgame. \n\nAs far as stocks go:\n\n\\- Personally (I have a very high risk appetite and im currently invested almost 100%in tech), I view Tesla as an extremely risky stock. I would nix it...especially now that there is some crazy talk of going private.\n\n\\- Twitter is a speculative growth stock to the max. Nix it also. Stocks like Netflix will also be relatively speculative and high growth but at least have a bit more to show for it. \n\n\\- IMO when it comes to tech, the real anchors are AMZN, microsoft, aapl, fb, google. Personally, I think those stocks have a lot of backbone compared to AMD, tesla, twitter. I also really like NVDA but im probably just blind and partial since I got lucky and bought at $55. \n\n\\- If I were in your shoes right now, I would take 10-15k of my portfolio and buy 1k of an s&p ETF every other week until it runs out. DCA is a powerful tool and I personally believe that a well balanced portfolio should have a healthy dose of  broad base index at its core. It might not be the next nflx but its a shit ton safer than Tesla.

A lot of your actions seem inherently contradictory to your goal of low risk, slow growth. I'm gunna break my advice down into 2 categories: picking stocks, and macro investing strategies. \n\nLets start with investing strategy: \n\n\\- Assuming that you are planning to have this money invested for 3-5-10 years (thinking long term), you need to start to train your self to buy and forget. You should rethink/rebalance your portfolio MAYBE once or twice a year but ideally, if you put in your work initially, you shouldnt have to do much tinkering. So, unless your trading, your conclusion that you shouldn't buy or hold through an ER seems pretty incorrect to me. \n\n\\- There is top down investing and bottom up investing (look it up if you don't know already). For top down strategies, ERs should be pretty irrelevant except for maybe when you are trying to find a good entry/exit point. For bottom up strategies, it could be more relevant, but even then you are going to have to hold your stock through an ER. \n\n\\- Sometimes selling your losers is the right thing to do. But, you shouldnt just sell because its losing, you should sell because you realize that you made a fundamental miscalculation or the market has somehow shifted (china trade shit showing up out of nowhere, for example). \n\n\\- If you are new to investing, I would recommend not taking a highly active hand with your portfolio. Most will agree that time in the market will yield returns...start with that and then once you become more experienced, slowly start to manage your positions a bit more. Generally tho, it sounds like you have been trading which is an entirely different ballgame. \n\nAs far as stocks go:\n\n\\- Personally (I have a very high risk appetite and im currently invested almost 100%in tech), I view Tesla as an extremely risky stock. I would nix it...especially now that there is some crazy talk of going private.\n\n\\- Twitter is a speculative growth stock to the max. Nix it also. Stocks like Netflix will also be relatively speculative and high growth but at least have a bit more to show for it. \n\n\\- IMO when it comes to tech, the real anchors are AMZN, microsoft, aapl, fb, google. Personally, I think those stocks have a lot of backbone compared to AMD, tesla, twitter. I also really like NVDA but im probably just blind and partial since I got lucky and bought at $55. \n\n\\- If I were in your shoes right now, I would take 10-15k of my portfolio and buy 1k of an s&p ETF every other week until it runs out. DCA is a powerful tool and I personally believe that a well balanced portfolio should have a healthy dose of  broad base index at its core. It might not be the next nflx but its a shit ton safer than Tesla.

It\u2019s really different from most companies/stocks you see today and is more or less a trust revolving around land in Texas that is publicly traded. Like you said, they do share buy backs every once in a while with money they have left over and they also offer a fairly small and modest dividend.\n\nThe company works by holding thousands of acres of land in Western Texas. While they don\u2019t do any digging, drilling, farming/ranching, or building on the land themselves, they still manage to make some sizable returns off the land off royalties and leases. They allow oil companies to drill, farmers/ranchers to use the land, and recently started getting into the water game as well. They\u2019ll occasionally sell off acres of land here and there as well but that only accounts for a small percentage of their business most years. \n\nThe company is pretty tied to how the oil sector is performing. I imagine in time it will be correlated with the water industry as well and while this part of their business has been growing, it is still a bit of ways away from full implementation. What I like about them is how they have so much land at their hands that it can kind of act as a back up plan if things aren\u2019t looking too well with oil businesses. They can sell some land to make up for difficult years if they absolutely have to and I think getting into the water game is a great idea for the long term, especially in a place like Texas. Oil isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon but I think it\u2019s smart to diversify before it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe team leading the company is made up of a few old timers who are all well experienced and regarded. They have a pretty solid track record and despite being a publicly traded company, they only have a few dozen employees. Expenses are pretty modest for them.\n\nMy biggest concerns with this company is how correlated it can potentially be to oil prices and the strength of the industry. If oil is cheap and/or the sector is struggling, they may have difficulty in obtaining money from oil companies using the land. To counter this somewhat, they often arrange for ten year leases with these companies and take a hands off approach with the actual oil drilling and production. \n\nMy other concern is with the land itself. I did a fair deal of research on the company but I\u2019m not exactly an expert on land and environmental issues. How much of this land is useful? Is it land with plentiful areas of oil, farmland, water resources, etc. or is there a lot of empty, useless land? That\u2019s something that concerned me and I ultimately couldn\u2019t find much of an answer that was clear enough in my research.\n\nA final concern with them is how the whole company is based and dependent upon the state of Texas, particularly the western part of the state. There really isn\u2019t any international or even out of state factors that come into play with a company like this besides oil prices and the sector\u2019s performance. If Texas hits some turbulence with its economy or say has a period of some really bad years of weather/droughts then maybe that could negatively impact them? I\u2019m not totally sure to be honest but I think it\u2019s worth considering.\n\nThe company is almost like an alien or stranger from the past. This is a company with a unique buyback system and one that will, most years, move relatively modestly. The past few years have been an obvious exception but if you look at years past you\u2019ll see some stable yet somewhat stagnant periods. In today\u2019s market with heavy reliance on tech and higher risk higher reward mindsets, TPL is sort of an outlier.\n\nI like the company and am happy to have it as a small portion of my portfolio.
