This is not stopping anytime soon. Their other ventures might hold them back but nothing is slowing this growth. Companies are in a mass scale transitioning from on premise to cloud and almost all of them already have Microsoft servers and Microsoft products like office. So my angle is primarily coming from their cloud growth. Whether its building a cloud infrastructure that allows companies to build their own platforms or cloud services like office 365. Their CEO is a cloud specialist appointed to bring Microsoft to this new era and he is doing a fantastic job in putting the companies focus in this direction. He did some dirty things too in the process. Sold windows 10 as a free product but bloated it with ads (as seen in start menus) and forcing updates even if IT departments try to stop it with scripts. But its good too, when Intel and AMD fuck up with their chip flaws, Microsoft is the first to address these with forced updates. \n\nI am not a huge fan of their xbox service, their surface products and a few others. But overall its a great time for the cloud push because typical server longevity for traditional on premise servers at offices about 5 years time. And a lot of servers are now retiring & companies are considering the switch to the cloud as it has years of support for proof of concept and its gotten cheap enough to be a better alternative financially.\n\nBut if you ask me at a fundamental level, does the PEG justify the price? No. Nor does it justify the bulk of tech  companies of today anyways. Amazon for example is unrealistic too. I believe its 6? Regardless, neither of these will slow down any time soon because of it.

The same arguments could have been said about microsoft back when IBM dominated the computer world. Going from 1% to 2% when a Goliath already dominates the platform is a big deal especially when, as you mention, their are other competitions too that are chipping away at the market too. Also when you consider the growth rate that Microsoft is growing at relative to their competition. Early 2017 Market share is very different from early 2018 market share. Compare the two to get a visual idea. They wont take down AWS and become the leader by a long shot however. 40% growth of AWS is still more clients than even 400% for Microsoft. AWS is far too ahead now for that to even be possible and they are very innovative with the new features they add as well. And you also have to break down what it is that microsoft is doing and what AWS is doing as well. They are not doing 100% the same thing. \n\nLike I said I work as an IT consultant for a major MSP and I visit 100s of companies a year and help develop projects for the companies with my team. The vast majority are transitioning to Microsoft cloud services across the board. Not just in my MSP but also all of our competition. And it is Primarily being pushed for their exchange service. Not because we have favoritism or anything ( I happen to like AWS more than Azure and think what amazon did was brilliant. I owned their  shares for many years now). We would happily apply AWS or G Suite. But Microsoft still leads in the business email services & office suite (Google's G Suite is as close to Microsoft in this regard as AWS is to Azure). And that is what they are using as their primary push today to get people on the cloud not infrastructure services like Azure. AWS is infrastructure only, it does not offer its own email service nor does it offer its own office like suite. On that infrastructure you have to use third party software and operating systems (including many of Microsoft's licensed products) in order for it to work. So on that point Microsoft is the leader in the cloud front where second place (being google's g suite) is nothing. \n\nBut you are entitled to your opinion.

Everytime I see this question asked, I see a lot of negative feedback. Of course there is quite a bit of competition, which is able and intimidating. But imho this does not have to be bad, it means Spotify needs to stay sharp and focus on innovation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, being European (Dutch), I hardly hear anyone talk about Apple or Google music. Since I\u2019m interested in this IPO, I\u2019ve been asking around a bit, and pretty much every friend, family member or co-worker uses Spotify. So my guess is, there is a difference in perspective as well, from both an American and European pov. Another thing is, my telecom provider provides Spotify free of 4g data usage. Meaning I can listen wherever I want and for how long I want. I know this might change in the near future, but many people switch to either Spotify or change telecom providers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne other thing is the Spotify eco system and potential to shake up the music landscape. I honestly think that the music sector still has to go through a certain paradigm change like the movie/tv show did. Not saying Spotify will change this on their own, but I\u2019m quite sure they\u2019ll stay around and be a serious player, globally. I\u2019m not sure about Spotify being a platform for new artists, but knowing a few, I feel Spotify offers them quite a few opportunities as well. I might be a tad too optimistic, that is why I\u2019ll probably go long on Spotify, but I figured the general response to the IPO is a bit too negative.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 0.5, "submission_title": "Anyone planning on investing in Spotify or Dropbox?", "submission_text": "Thoughts on Spotify or Dropbox?
