But if that guy is saying to simply buy a call vs buying 100 shares this is rarely a good idea. \n\nWhen buying an option you have intrinsic value (the value of the option if you were to exercise it now) and extrinsic value (basically just premium priced into the option to account for volatility and expected movement). That premium puts you at a disadvantage as soon as you buy the option. Let's say you want to buy 100 shares of XYZ trading at $10/share. You would have to put up $1,000 to buy those shares. Nice and simple. For the option though you have to pick the strike and expiration date. Let's say you pick a strike of $10 for simplicity's sake and an expiration of 2 months. That option is trading at my made up number of $50. This means XYZ has to get to $10.50/share just for you to break even at expiration. At that point if it kept going up you would make much more profit relative to just buying 100 shares, on a percentage basis. If at the end of 2 months XYZ was trading at $11, your 100 shares would be worth $1,100, a $100 or a 10% gain. Whereas your option would be worth $100, a $50 gain or 100%.\n\nThis example rarely happens though because options are priced based on expected movement. I think it's something like 90% of options expire worthless.

This means you can potentially leverage your gains - but also your losses.\n\n> not like oh I can loose 100% of the money for the contract.\n\nAs you say, you sure can! The idea here is to make sure you deal in a contract that modifies your investment strategy in a favorable way; such as considering buying a Put option if you can't afford for your stock going below a certain price, or selling a Call if you're fairly sure that the stock isn't going to be worth substantially more than the strike price (or would have been inclined to sell at the Strike price, anyhow)\n\n> That isn\u2019t what scares me, what scares me is if your doing this because you can\u2019t afford stock and you get \u201cassigned\u201d it seems like your screwed.\n\nYes and no. With most investment accounts, if you don't have the funds to purchase the stock on a call you own outright when assigned to exercise, they'll liquidate some or all of the stock at the market price to pay for the purchase. You still profit Market price - Strike price - Fees in that scenario (though sometimes this can go as negative as being forced to pay the cost of the fees plus a bit).\n\n> I know the two main types are call when you expect it to go up and put when you expect it to go down.\n\nThat's the general gist - you buy a call if you expect the stock price to shoot up during the contract to the point where it's significantly higher than the Strike Price + Option Price (if it's close to Strike Price + Option Price, you can get hit with the fees and not really benefit from the purchase - but that's part of the risk). Alternatively, you would sell a call if you believe that the stock price won't go significantly above Strike Price + Option Price during the contract. Your risk here is that if the stock price goes significantly above that point, you've lost potential gains, and if the stock price drops by more than the option price, you've lost money and may be unable to liquidate the stock to stop your loss.\n\nSimilarly, you would buy a Put if you want to reduce the risk of your stock dropping in value - if you're looking at a situation where there's a 50% chance that your stock loses $10 and a 50% chance that your stock gains $10, you can improve your expected outcome by buying a Put with a strike price equal to the current stock price with a cost (net of fees) of less than $5/option. Of course that means that the best case isn't as good - but it also means the worst case isn't as bad.\n\nYou might also sell a put if you have some interest in buying the stock, and have cash available to do so. You might sell an out-of-the-money put if you'd otherwise be inclined to buy the stock if/when it hit Strike Price - Option Cost (net of fees), but see a significant chance that it might not hit that level. If your sold out-of-the-money put is exercised (after becoming in-the-money) there's a risk you may end up overpaying for the stock - but assuming that you have the cash in your account to cover the exercise, you'd at least have the stock to show for the purchase. Essentially, if the stock price remains at Strike price - Option Cost or higher, you win. If it goes below, you lose.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 37, "submission_ratio": 0.05405405405405406, "submission_title": "How are options food for beginners?", "submission_text": "So recently came back from an event, and yes I take it with a grain of salt as it was a lot of marketing.

You risk losing the premium of the contract (the cost from buying it; no more than that). If the stock price increases enough for your option to be profitable (100 * current stock price > 100 * strike price + premium) this is called \"in the money\", and several things may happen. \n\n1. If this is still true at expiration date, you can exercise your option and buy 100 shares at the strike price\n2. If you do not have enough money at expiration to exercise, most brokerages like Robinhood will try to sell the options contract for you. Yes, the contract itself is worth money (remember the premium your paid for it), and its cost will go up and down with the stock price (+ some other more complicated factors). So if the stock price moves significantly, the contract can be worth more -- someone richer than you would want that right to exercise the option at your strike price. \n3. Anytime before expiry, you may try to sell the contract for the same reasons above. \n\nSo technically, options are an easy way for folks to trade expensive stocks -- you are not holding the stocks yourself, but holding and betting on the *options contract to buy and sell* the stock -- which are a lot cheaper than the stock itself.

Suggesting a beginner dive into options is not good advise. \n\nAlso you will have to qualify with your brokerage. Basically they have to ensure you can qualify for margin so the trades can execute. Did he mention that?  Trading options can put you in debt if the trade goes the wrong way. \n\nI\u2019ve done a little options trading. And unless you can purchase a lot of contracts you could wind up making very little. I had once case where trading fees ate up what little profit the trade made. So I just let it expire. So if you\u2019re small peanut in options trading it\u2019s not much better then being a small trader in stocks. \n\nI look at options as a form of leverage. For a small fee you are controlling a block of 100 shares.  So if the market rewards you, the gain can be larger then owning 10 shares. But fees, margin costs etc all reduce that gain. \n\nHopefully he warned you to not short as a beginner.  Shorts sometimes get squeezed and actually drive the price of stocks up.   When they have to buy to cover their position before the contract expires, it has caused prices to rise. \n\nGood luck.

You risk losing the premium of the contract (the cost from buying it; no more than that). If the stock price increases enough for your option to be profitable (100 * current stock price > 100 * strike price + premium) this is called \"in the money\", and several things may happen. \n\n1. If this is still true at expiration date, you can exercise your option and buy 100 shares at the strike price\n2. If you do not have enough money at expiration to exercise, most brokerages like Robinhood will try to sell the options contract for you. Yes, the contract itself is worth money (remember the premium your paid for it), and its cost will go up and down with the stock price (+ some other more complicated factors). So if the stock price moves significantly, the contract can be worth more -- someone richer than you would want that right to exercise the option at your strike price. \n3. Anytime before expiry, you may try to sell the contract for the same reasons above. \n\nSo technically, options are an easy way for folks to trade expensive stocks -- you are not holding the stocks yourself, but holding and betting on the *options contract to buy and sell* the stock -- which are a lot cheaper than the stock itself.

In most trading sites/programs, it will show you as owning a negative number of options when you are in a short position, and that's the only time you have an assignment risk.\n\nNote, though, that many options strategies (such as verticals) involve buying an option at one strike and selling another option at another strike.  It's usually best to think of these strategies as a single trade, even though technically there are two different options being traded within that trade.  In these situations, if the short side of the trade gets assigned early, the long side can be exercised to cover it.  In other words, if you have +3 AAPL 180 calls and -3 AAPL 185 calls, and the 185 calls get assigned early because AAPL is at 195*, you'll be forced to sell 300 shares of AAPL at 185.  You might not have 300 shares of AAPL, but you do have 3 AAPL calls at 180.  You can exercise the AAPL calls to buy 300 shares at 180 and cover the deficit.  You would ultimately make money on that trade ($1500 minus whatever you paid for the spread in the first place minus commissions/fees), and even though the assignment is inconvenient, it's something you can deal with.\n\nThat's why options trading generally requires a margin account, because you may need margin to cover early assignment temporarily until you can cover the result.  If your margin requirement is hugely exceeded because of assignment, but you have a corresponding option that can be exercised to cover it, your broker has the choice to exercise the option for you to cover the position instead of letting you sit there with -300 AAPL or -$54000.\n\nOne other note - early assignment is infrequent.  Most people don't exercise contracts until expiration (there are a few exceptions, of course), because it's generally easier to sell a long option position and get your money out of it that way instead of exercising it.  But options are automatically exercised at expiration when they are ITM, so if you are short an ITM contract at expiration, it will get assigned.\n\n\\* This might happen during the few days before expiration.  It might also happen just before an ex dividend date, because the person who owns that option won't get the dividend - only actual stockholders get dividends, and so if they want to pick up the dividend for cheap they might exercise the option.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 37, "submission_ratio": 0.08108108108108109, "submission_title": "How are options food for beginners?", "submission_text": "So recently came back from an event, and yes I take it with a grain of salt as it was a lot of marketing.

In most trading sites/programs, it will show you as owning a negative number of options when you are in a short position, and that's the only time you have an assignment risk.\n\nNote, though, that many options strategies (such as verticals) involve buying an option at one strike and selling another option at another strike.  It's usually best to think of these strategies as a single trade, even though technically there are two different options being traded within that trade.  In these situations, if the short side of the trade gets assigned early, the long side can be exercised to cover it.  In other words, if you have +3 AAPL 180 calls and -3 AAPL 185 calls, and the 185 calls get assigned early because AAPL is at 195*, you'll be forced to sell 300 shares of AAPL at 185.  You might not have 300 shares of AAPL, but you do have 3 AAPL calls at 180.  You can exercise the AAPL calls to buy 300 shares at 180 and cover the deficit.  You would ultimately make money on that trade ($1500 minus whatever you paid for the spread in the first place minus commissions/fees), and even though the assignment is inconvenient, it's something you can deal with.\n\nThat's why options trading generally requires a margin account, because you may need margin to cover early assignment temporarily until you can cover the result.  If your margin requirement is hugely exceeded because of assignment, but you have a corresponding option that can be exercised to cover it, your broker has the choice to exercise the option for you to cover the position instead of letting you sit there with -300 AAPL or -$54000.\n\nOne other note - early assignment is infrequent.  Most people don't exercise contracts until expiration (there are a few exceptions, of course), because it's generally easier to sell a long option position and get your money out of it that way instead of exercising it.  But options are automatically exercised at expiration when they are ITM, so if you are short an ITM contract at expiration, it will get assigned.\n\n\\* This might happen during the few days before expiration.  It might also happen just before an ex dividend date, because the person who owns that option won't get the dividend - only actual stockholders get dividends, and so if they want to pick up the dividend for cheap they might exercise the option.", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 0.3333333333333333}, {"time": 1528485772.0, "submission_id": "8piiu7", "comment_id": "e0cezoy", "body": "Ahhh I see that\u2019s where I was getting lost.

Everything is about growth potential.  Guidance will trump everything in an earnings report. (i.e. ttwo's last earnings report being a perfect example)\n\nAmazon has endless amount of growth potential. Bezos is a genius at a meta business level now. He can buy anything and turn in to a gold mine (Even from those who were already leaders of a product/service, i.e. Apple's Siri getting over taken by Alexa. Alexa makes Siri look like a joke now). Hence why the high P/E does not matter. As long as Bezos take the profits and reinvests and keeps growing, there is no stopping him.\n\nNow we come to MU. MU is an excellent company with cutting edge memory technology. Their financials are in order, their value is great. Everything is perfect. What deters it however (I believe) is this fear of their business all of the sudden not working. The fear of their business model being cyclical.\n\nThis was true for a very long time so it does hold water. However early 2000s was only dipping its toes in tech... computers were looked at as a nerdy hobby or a business tool. Most people only interacted with TV/Radio still. But these FUD thumpers dont realize how different the 2018 landscape is. Everything is becoming computerized and every computer needs memory to operate. Whether its cars, phones, interfaces of all kinds, you name it.  I work in IT so I will share some preceptive you might not hear often.\n\n\"Data\" is the most valued possession in our society now. So much so that cyber security is a bigger threat to society than physical terrorists like we have been accustomed to. Working in IT security is serious money for this very reason. This is the new frontier of the cold war. I dont remember the exact numbers but its something like we produce more data (written) in 1 year than the last century combined (or something ridiculous like that). Data is stored somewhere. Nowadays its all going to the cloud with large datacentres that MU is everywhere in. Websites are so common now (the dotcom era got nothing on this era), each of these are hosting data somewhere. AI collects data and stores it somewhere, every action you take on sites gets acquired by companies like google, amazon, etc store it for advertisements/suggestions. Your banks are holding data now rather than just paperwork. Video games, movies and music used to be physical things that now are all digital data files.. I mean I can go on and on with data and how different that landscape is. Point being this data is held on infrastructures that is possible with products that MU offers and its only growing as far as we can see.\n\nSo we wont see this cyclical change that everybody fears. Old tech always gets replaced by new tech, i mentioned cloud earlier. When you pay for cloud services, you are giving major corporations the privilege to hold your data. They wont mess around and let your data sit on legacy servers with old memory (like most businesses since the dotcom era do). No they will constantly upgrade and buy NEW memory to service your data. This alone marks the end of cyclical nature of it all on some degree (as long as MU is making faster/better chips)\n\nSo this fear will eventually fade as Micron continues to prove this taking point wrong. MU by the end of 2019 will be at $150\\-200. This is the year they prove this.

They shoot up, then the world gets a glut of chips and demand crashes. I have no knowledge about the current or expected market, but this has happened multiple times historically and people don't like getting burned. They are hesitant to bid it too high in case a crash is coming soon. If this time is even a little different, MU is a bargain.\n\nAlso, two quick things in general:\n\nFirst of all, I'm seeing MU's TTM at about seven. I'm not sure where you got your figures. I'm using Yahoo Finance.\n\nSecond, I'd recommend not using trailing earnings. Forward earnings are more important and more relevant, since it is where the company is going. It is also where you have space to be smarter than other people. If for some reason, guidance is garbage, and you can figure out why, you'll have a good opportunity to best the market. That being said, it is probably usually the case that if you think everyone else is crazy, you're missing something.\n\nSo using forward PE for these two companies, MU is a bit under six and AMZN is 85; much more reasonable than 300+.\n\nYou can even see between these trailing and forward earnings how crazy the expected growth for AMZN is compared to MU.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m now Long MU via calls.

That wasn\u2019t something they were too concerned about years ago during the pricing hiking scandal days. However, while the drugs appear promising from a medical standpoint it\u2019s yet to really be seen if they\u2019re going to bring in the money to offset the LOE on other drugs and help chip away at the debt. We\u2019ll just have to see how they perform.\n\nThey were also just called out a few months ago by California for a 63% price hike on a generic glaucoma drug. Back in January, CEO Joe Papa addressed 9% price hikes among several key drugs and assured they were reasonable and how he\u2019s still keeping Valeant\u2018s past history of price gauging in mind. The move may come off as a desperation move though. If new drugs are producing the sales they hoped for and they have to rely on price hikes to make up the difference then it can be concerning as an investor as you still have roughly $25B in debt to pay off (though short term debt looks manageable. They reduced the debt due in 2020 from $4.7B to $2.7B in Feb2018 and then knocked off another $1B in less than 3 months).\n\nOverall, I think leadership is strong and that\u2019s important for a company trying to turn it around. The quick down payment of debt is encouraging but you still have a mountain of it left to overcome. It\u2019s also encouraging to see a variety of new drugs hit the market/be approved as well as resolving over 20 legal issues and coming out relatively clean. A return to organic revenue growth is also a positive, of course, and both the B+L and Salix segments are showing strength (combined for 10% organic growth over Q1 2017) as they should since they account for 76% of Q1 2018 revenue. Increasing guidance for the year is always a good thing too. They also seem to be winning their case against Teva/Mylan over their infringement on a patent Valeant has for Relistor, prescriptions of which have risen from 846 in \u201811 to 5,459 in March 2018.\n\nGoing forward you have to watch for the performance of the drugs they\u2019ve launched over the last 6-8 months. Eye care and dermatology are key drivers of revenue so you hope that that continues to grow. At this point, I think most agree that the Valeant has done a tremendous job during this turnaround so far. What remains to be seen is can they continue to grow sales and new product and how will they continue to manage the debt load.\n\nDisclosure: I am long VRX since Novemeber \u201817.
