Do you want cash flow or want to grow paper gains. On top of that cash flow means taxation vs growth means deferred taxes (pay when you sell).\n\nBuffett said something along the lines of: a company that pays out dividend instead of retaining and reinvesting cash is a company that has run out of room/ideas to grow. Hence, BRK does not pay out a dividend, because he thinks they will continue to grow.\n\nOn the flip side Buffett said something about liking dividend paying companies.\n\nWhenever a dividend is paid out, the company is giving out a portion of its assets. When you hit the ex-dividend date the stock tends to dip. This is because the company is actually worth a little less as the cash of a paid out dividend is no longer part of the company.\n\nWhen you look at BRK the stock price is up because they are retaining the earnings and reinvesting it back into the business/making acquisitions to increase earnings instead of paying out cash to shareholders. All things being equal, if a dividend paying company did the same and retained cash, it theoretically would have a higher share price.\n\nSimple example, not getting into cash flow, debt, etc. Pretend you have a company with 1,000 shares each worth $1. This means your company is valued at $1,000. If you issued a dividend of $0.10 / share (x1000 shares = $100 dividend) then each share would be revalued downwards to $0.90 and hence (x1000 shares), your company is now worth $900 because you took out $100 of the company valued $1,000 in the form of dividends.\n\nAs for why people would buy a company that didn't pay out dividends there's the tax reason and retained earnings/growth aspect. How could you extract value/cash flow from a company that doesn't pay dividends?

Let me try again.\n\nNet cash is cash minus debt (not all liabilities). Yes correct, it generally can be used to translate between market cap and EV.  However in this case it\u2019s not applicable for many reasons.  Firstly, you\u2019re looking at a consolidated balance sheet which includes cash held at regulated insurance subsidiaries which is not necessarily available to pay off HoldCo debt so it makes the cash figure arbitrary.  Secondly, financial institutions are unique in that they hold other marketable securities to support claims (or for banks, deposits), so in effect the amount held in cash is irrelevant when considering other fungible forms of liquidity available.\n\nAnd when you keep expanding that idea further, you\u2019re right back at either total assets or tangible assets.
