You can always buy back in later when the stock is back in an uptrend.\n\nOr wait to buy when price bounces off weekly SMA 20 or 30, or even daily SMA 50, yes people wait for price to come down before they buy causing rallies and new uptrends.\n\nYou don't have to hold through the fall, just sell & buy later.

Focus to the points, not the syntax or words that I used that have nothing to do with the argument.\n\n>It does matter to them. People won't want to pay for a service they are barely using. This will affect their retention rates.\n\nAre you telling me people will not pay for Internet because they only check their emails once a day or play solitaire on their computers? The older generation of Americans disagree. You don't even need to go to China to find examples like this. Here in the US, blue collar workers will have data on their phone and/or Internet in their home regardless of how much hours they're stuck at their job. People pay for subscriptions that they don't optimize all the time. You probably have some subscription that you don't fully use. I know I do, I have this stupid magazine subscription that I barely flip through every month, about to cancel it as we speak. Of course the X amount of time matters to the company, but not to the subscribers. The X amount of time is more for budgeting on their side (iQiyi), like how Netflix canceled Marco Polo because they weren't pulling in enough viewers to pay for such a high budget show. No duh it matters, but to the opposite side. You're comparing apples to oranges.\n\n>What constitutes as \"middle and upper class\" in China would be considered poor to lower middle class in the US. \n\nSeriously? I know you have never been to China. I know that you're blinded by the American media (probably your country's too) and/or Reddit's anti-China circlejerk. But can you at least Google or YouTube what modern China is like today? The middle and upper classes are definitely not considered poor to the lower middle class. In case you don't know, middle and upper classes in China drive Lexus's, BMW's, Maserati's, and Ferrari's. Do people in lower middle class in the US do that? No, you also don't know that because you're not an American. \n\nLook up cashless China on YouTube. You think the US/your country is fancy because you guys carry credit cards? In China, nobody even uses credit cards anymore. Everything is cashless, a smartphone is all you need. Going from taking a cab, renting a bike, going to grocery shopping, taking the subway, buying train tickets, paying for goods at a store, eating at a restaurant, etc... this list goes on and on. When I was in China, restaurants were offering discount for me to use WeChat Pay (the cashless app) to pay because they don't want to deal with counterfeit money and/or credit card fees. I'm not even talking about top-level cities like Beijing or Shanghai. I'm talking about second and third level cities like Foshan, Zhongshan, Hefei, Chanzhou, etc. aka cities you probably have never heard of.\n\nAnd also, people in China have a much lower cost of standard of living. While they do make less on average in comparison to the American people, food, rent, bills are wayyyy cheaper.\n\n>Also, in addition to working longer hours, Chinese also have longer commutes.\n\nProof? Are you really going to pull random stuff out of your rear again? I live in NYC, my commute is on average is 3 hours back and forth. I have visited China and have Chinese friends/investors/business owners who own factories and business. Most workers live nearby, some take public transportation and some even bike to work. I don't know the average time that the workers travel to work as I have never asked every single person and did the math, but definitely not more than 1 hour on average. And I'm just talking about blue collar factory workers here. Some of the white collar workers who work in the office drive to work. So again, you don't live in the US nor China, yet you claim like you do. Okay, we can totally see how reliable you really are.\n\n>Have you noticed when most of those films were banned though? In the last 3-4 years. In other words, when Xi Jinping became the General Secretary of Communist party. He's much more socially and politically conservative than his predecessors, and he recently abolished the 2-terms limit for his position, meaning he can stay there indefinitely.\n\nAnd again, only really big hits get land in big theaters in China. Big established films like Stars Wars or Jurassic Parks do, not like I don't know, Baby Driver (just a random American movie I thought of). You must be pretty close-minded to think Chinese only want American movies and TV shows. East Asian media and show biz still dominate over there. It's the #1 thing that they will tune in, not other western films. Again, that's not to say big movie like the MCU don't get tons of hype there, my point: only REALLY big western hits.\n\n>That doesn't change the fact that iQiyi won't be able to offer an as diverse selection of entertainment. \n\n[You can at least do a little research, bud.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQiyi#History)\n>**History**\n----\n>Qiyi was founded on April 22, 2010 by Baidu, which is China\u2019s largest online search engine, and Providence Equity Partners,[7] and changed its name to iQiyi in November 2011.[1] On November 2, 2011, it purchased the online license for Transformers: Dark of the Moon in mainland China from Paramount. On November 2, 2012, Baidu bought Providence\u2019s stake and took 100% ownership of the site.[8] On May 7, 2013, Baidu purchased the online video business of PPStream Inc. for $370 million, which became a subsidiary of iQiyi. On July 17, 2014, the site launched its film production division, iQiyi Motion Pictures, to expand existing cooperative projects with overseas peers, including purchasing releases and co-producing movies. On September 4, iQiyi cooperated with Venice Film Festival, streaming of the festival\u2019s movies online. On August 2014, iQiyi generated over 6.95 billion hours of viewing on its website.[9] In October, iQiyi participated in the Busan Film Festival, signing exclusive rights to nearly 100 South Korean titles.[10] On November 19, 2014, Xiaomi and Shunwei Capital invested $300 Million in iQiyi for about 10 percent to 15 percent of the site, while Baidu invested an additional $100 million and held about 80 percent.[11]\n\n>On December 8, 2014, iQiyi's chief content officer Ma Dong said the portal planned to more than double original production in 2015, with at least 30 titles and 500 episodes on the slate compared to 13 in 2014.[12] In 2015, iQiyi purchased the online copyrights of eight top entertainment shows in mainland China, and several entertainment shows in Taiwan and South Korea, including the Running Man.[13] In March 2016, it announced it would launch in Taiwan.[14] In June 2016 it reported it had 20 million subscribers.[15]\n\n>On April 25, 2017, Netflix announced that it had reached a licensing deal with iQiyi, under which some Netflix original productions will be available on iQiyi day-and-date with their premiere elsewhere.[16]\n\n----\n\n>Wether or not American movies/shows are more popular than Chinese ones are irrelevant, because what matters is how much of a wide selection they offer.\n\nAs you can already see, they do offer a wide selection, and it's only the beginning. Look at the timelines, they're still expanding. And why wouldn't it be irrelevant? You literally just contradicted yourself. You need specific types of products to attract specific type of audience. This is how businesses work at the core level, supply and demand. If they offer shows that aren't big hits nor hypes, why would people even bother subscribing or look into it? You telling me that people care more quantities over qualities? So essentially, you're saying that if Netflix suddenly offered 1 billion of C-rated TV shows and movies and removed all their original contents and A-rated stuff, they will have a huge boost in subscriptions?\n\n>And again, Netflix is a global company, iQiyi never will be.\n\nChina alone has a population of 1.3 billion. But if you won't believe that the middle and upper classes are growing then there's nothing more to say. Regardless of that fact, even the lower class would use iQiyi. When I was in China at the factories and facilities, during lunch break, a lot of the blue collar workers would wipe our their smartphones and watch Chinese dramas and/or movies. Entertainment is still a huge part of their lives. iQiyi isn't going to be limited just in China. The givens are Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, I would even throw Singapore in there. They already purchased copyrights and shows from Taiwan and South Korea (Running Man, it's a huge hit in Asia, even in some parts of the US). Also, in case you didn't know ,Chinese dramas and films aren't just limited to Chinese audience only. Thailand and Vietnam are a huge marketing audience too, look it up. You also have overseas Chinese in those countries and in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and even Australia. If you don't think iQiyi will expand out of China then again, there's nothing more to say.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 16, "submission_ratio": 0.125, "submission_title": "IQ and HUYA long term beliefs?", "submission_text": "In my opinion IQ and HUYA are good long term bets, I just want to hear a bit from the people who agree and from those who disagree to get some ideas flowing around.

The middle and upper classes are growing consistently. So this is a perfect long game for a stock like $IQ. Also, while Americans do have shorter working hours, Americans also have one of the least amount of holidays in the world. In comparison to China, they get way more. But anyhow, don't want to go on and on. Your point of \"Chinese don't watch TV/don't have time\" is just dumb.\n\nWhat constitutes as \"middle and upper class\" in China would be considered poor to lower middle class in the US. Besides, China's population is declining due to low birth rates and there's no sign of increase in sight. A great share of social mobility that Chinese have witnessed in the last 20 or so years is due to [demographic dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demographic-dividend.asp) and now it's coming to an end and it will even be reversed a few decades from now.\n\nAlso, in addition to working longer hours, Chinese also have longer commutes.\n\n2.

The Seller must provide the stocks at that price, if the seller does not have the stocks, they will have to purchase them at the current price before selling them to the buyer. If the stock does not reach the strike price before the contract expires, the buyer is out the premiums.\n\nA put contract allows the buyer to sell stock to the seller at the strike price. If the current price is below the strike, the buyer can buy them at the lower price and immediately sell them to the contract owner at the strike.\n\nExample 1: I received 200 shares of stock from my companies ESPP program. I can sell a \"covered call\" for July 26 at a strike price $5 higher than it's current. I get $2 / share or $400 right away. If the stock stays where it is, I keep the $400 and the stock.\nIf the price rises by $10, then the buyer will exercise the contract and I have to sell at the strike price (plus I still keep the $400). I miss the extra $5 / share gain, but I still sold the stock at a profit, just not as big as a profit as I could have.  The buyer gets my stock at a $5 discount, and adding in the $2/share they paid me, they earn $3/share.\n\nA Put is the opposite. Let's say I were to buy a put for a strike price of $40, and pay a $2 premium. The price drops to $30. I then buy 100 shares at $30, and sell them to the contract owner for $40, making $8 / share profit. If the price does not drop, I am out the $200 premium.\n\nThat's the basics.

It dropped down significantly immediately to something like 1.40 or something and I began to sweat (I\u2019m not used to day trading yet). It kept trading around 1.60-1.70 for a while and I finally decided to just try and get my money back, which I did, and proceeded to watch the stock go up to above $3 at its high....

Leaving the question up for informative reasons and if anyone else was wondering. So our WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. To calculate this we get\n\nWACC=E/(E + D)\\*Cost of Equity+D/(E + D)\\*Cost of Debt\\*(1 - Tax Rate)\n\n***The breakdown of this equation is***\n\nE = Market Cap (MM)\n\nD = Book value of Debt\n\nTax Rate = -34.84\n\nWeight of equity = E / (E + D) = *15.630 / (15.630 + 0) = 1*\n\nWeight of debt = D / (E + D) = 0 / (15.630} + 0) = 0\n\nCost of Equity = *2.93000000\\% + 5.19 \\* 6\\% = 34.07\\%*\n\nCost of Debt = *0.248 / 0 = 0\\%*\n\nTax Rate is *-34.84\\%.*\n\n***So inputting all of these into the original question (example 1.) we get***\n\nWACC=E / (E + D)\\*Cost of Equity+D / (E + D)\\*Cost of Debt\\*(1 - Tax Rate)\n\n= 1                  \\*  34.07&#37;              + 0       \\*  0 \\* (1 - -34.84&#37;)      = 34.07\n\nTherefore are WACC is 34.07&#37;\n\nSo really i was just forgetting the Cost of the equity section of the equation, along with the Average tax rates.
