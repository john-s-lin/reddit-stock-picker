If I am not mistaken, we refer to this as $100 worth of stock.\n\nThese Sellers each sell their shares to 10 Buyers. \n\nSeller 1 sells to Buyer 1 for $10. This causes the price of the stock to go down $1 to $9 (to keep it simple).\n\nIf I am not mistaken, the valuation of this stock would now be considered to be $90 (10 shares x $9).\n\nLet's say every seller and buyer makes a subsequent trade, starting with seller/buyer 1:\n\n* 1\t: $10.00 \n* 2\t: $9.00 \n* 3\t: $8.00 \n* 4\t: $7.00 \n* 5\t: $6.00 \n* 6\t: $5.00 \n* 7\t: $4.00 \n* 8\t: $3.00 \n* 9\t: $2.00 \n* 10\t: $1.00 \n\n\nSo, at the end, all Sellers sold and all Buyers bought. The end valuation is $10 worth of stock across 10 shares. So, I think the reporting will be that \"$90 of wealth was wiped out in selling frenzy!\". \n\nCollectively, sellers made $55 by selling their shares. If compared to the initial $100 valuation, that is a 'loss' of $45.\n\nBuyers on the other hand spent $55 and saw a total depreciation of $45 ($55-$10 final valuation). \n\nThat adds up, $45+$45 = $90.\n\nThis feels wrong to me (which is maybe why I am an idiot). $10 per share does not so much mean to value of all the shares as much as it does the value of the first share sold at $10, right? I realize the rate of decline in value has a lot to do with the velocity of the trades. Over time, if traded slowly enough, the sellers might realize a total value near the $100 estimate over the total volume. It almost seems like you could generalize valuations in terms of sell rate, like if the volume of 10 shares were sold over 10 days, for $10 each, it would be $100(one share/day), but over one day (if we use the example I gave) it would be $55(ten shares/day).\n\nMaybe this is well understood, and is why phrases like 'is trading at' are used. It's just that anytime there is a decline in the market or a natural disaster, the reports are, \"one hundred kajillion dollars wiped out!\" Which really doesn't seem accurate to me. If every house on a coastline was put up for sale, the subsequent depreciation of that market would look like a natural disaster. Sorry for mixing metaphors.\n\nAlso it ignores that Buyer 10 obtained his position with $1, which is a big deal. Buyers' gains or losses are, as of yet, unrealized.
