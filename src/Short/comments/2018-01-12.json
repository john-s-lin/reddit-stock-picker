Not promising 100% perfection nor am I saying that this should null and void any homework/research or any potential homework/research you should be doing before completing a new investment purchase**\n\n\nIn the wake of the Ulta annual report coming up relatively soon, I decided to take a look back on last years annual report to make an investing decision for the 2018-2019 investing season.  \n\n\n**All numbers are in thousands**\n\n\n**Income Statement**\n\nGross profit increased 1,384,333 to 1,747,229\n\nOperating income increased 506,297 to 654,824 \n\n\n*Review*\n\nFor the amount of gross profit increase the operating income increase is actually higher margins then the year before(37% up from 36.5%).\n\nOn average net income increase 70,000 per year.\n\n\n**Balance sheet**\n\nTotal current assets = 1,536,237 with 385,000 equaling cash or cash equivalents(1/5th of all current assets).\n\nTotal liabilities = 1,001,660(accounts payable increased by 130,000)\n\n\n*Review*\n\nDon't look interested into divesting more assets to become a more cash ready business.\n\nYear over year there is significant divesting from short term investments. \n\n\n**Chart**\n\n-25% since June\n\n-11% year to date\n\n\n**Pros/Cons**\n\n*Pros*\n\nGood CEO\n\nCheaper place for cosmetics compared to some high end cosmetic independents\n\nMakeup is still receiving huge business from retail and during a recession when the cosmetic marketing budgets are cut from influencer marketing there will be an even bigger drive for retail sales\n\nLong term with a future in online sales increases I predict the stock hitting $300 while we see other independent cosmetics moving into retailers\n\n\n*Cons*\n\nThey still are retail, I believe there is going to be a need for Ulta to increase online revenues for all the pros to be true. \n\n\n**Do I believe in the company:** I see both short term and long term success for the company.

The reason there are 10 of them is that it's very likely that 2-4 of them will fail and go another way. The rest will perform good enough to cover for those losses actually. But picking any two with low risk tolerance... Then the safe play is the way to go.\n\nEven with the safe play everything is possible. Shit, 6 months ago I would have put EFX as one of the safest stock to buy in a contest like this. And then it dropped 25% overnight because of the hacking incident. Same thing can happen with V.

If you had a choice of buying, say, 10 stocks, then we could actually look into possibly having you winning this thing. Like, I have picks for myself, that I recently bought that I'm expecting to go up 10-30% in the next month, but they are somewhat risky. The reason there are 10 of them is that it's very likely that 2-4 of them will fail and go another way. The rest will perform good enough to cover for those losses actually. But picking any two with low risk tolerance... Then the safe play is the way to go.\n\nEven with the safe play everything is possible. Shit, 6 months ago I would have put EFX as one of the safest stock to buy in a contest like this. And then it dropped 25% overnight because of the hacking incident. Same thing can happen with V.
