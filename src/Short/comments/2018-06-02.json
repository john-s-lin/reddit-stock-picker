I pick a certain sector and I start looking through it. What I'm looking for mostly is small to mid cap growth stocks with high potential and room for improvement. Outside of Market Cap, I'm looking for good cash flow and strong EPS growth over at least 3 year period.\n\nOnce I have a company picked out on Morningstar, I then go to the IR page of the company and I read every financial article they have publicly available. I read their earnings reports dating back at least 2 years and I print out their balance sheets and analyze their growth. After that I generally will create a financial model in Excel that will mimic their growth pattern over the next 3 years. Once I have all that information I come to a decision on whether or not it makes sense to invest and how much to invest.\n\nI think everything I do can be done by any retail investor. Yes, the financial model may be extreme, but I like to know what I might be getting into so it doesn't hurt. If you know how to create a financial model and have the time I recommend doing so. If not, it's not a bad thing to learn if you're serious about your investing. I wouldn't say it's necessary though.

I listen to a few podcasts, read many of the common finance sites, and come on some of the investing subreddits. It\u2019s not advice I\u2019m really looking for but instead names of companies or news surrounding sectors I may not know of or otherwise overlooked. If I find something interesting or attractive I\u2019ll begin my research.\n\nI start by learning about both the company, sector, and product/service they\u2019re offering. I\u2019ll read the history behind it, who\u2019s leading the company, how popular it is, what trends are occurring, and the future outlook of the company and sector. I\u2019ll spend a half hour navigating their website. Look for any news articles or bad press concerning them. I\u2019ve even called companies before just to see how they answer the phone and if there customer service system is friendly, updated, and efficient just to get an idea of how things are operating and how they treat the people calling in.\n\nFor numbers I\u2019ll right off the bat simply google the company and pull up Yahoo or Morning Star go get a quick synopsis of the company. The numbers can sometimes be a little outdated or inaccurate but they\u2019ll give a decent idea of the company and its books. I\u2019ll see what some analysts are saying, how they performed against expectations, and how they fare against competitors.\n\nIf it still looks worthwhile, I\u2019ll move onto reading their actual reports and earning releases. These things can be long and quite boring to read but hold really important figures, views, and statements. This is where you can potentially find some parts that could provide beneficial or advantageous to you.\n\nKnowing the sector and who the company\u2019s competitors are is really important as well. Sometimes you may have research an additional 2-3 companies to get a good feel of how things are. I also try to stay within my range in terms of what I know and understand. Sometimes things like tech or pharmaceutical companies can get really complex that it\u2019s hard to really know how things are going if you don\u2019t truly understand the company or product.\n\nWith all that said, I only do this maybe 1-2 times per month. It\u2019s a lot of work to do and takes a fair deal of time to really learn about and understand a company. Not only that but there are professionals who have already done all that along with computer programs that also take those numbers into consideration and create formulas used by the big investment firms and brokerages. People and programs with more knowledge, skills, and resources than I could ever dream of having. \n\nMost of my portfolio is in index funds and then a little more than a handful in well established companies that have had every inch of their company looked over, audited, and speculated upon. The whole research system I use has only resulted in me making 4, what I would call, unconventional picks that aren\u2019t huge or super well know companies. So far I\u2019m batting 2 for 4 with one of those losers being an absolutely idiotic pick when I was new to investing. The other one hasn\u2019t moved too much but I\u2019ve also only held it for a few weeks so it\u2019s way too early to tell and like most of my holdings is there for the long term.\n\nBest advice I can give is to make sure you understand the company both from a financial standpoint and a product/service standpoint.

Just looking for insight on what to look for, how to find it etc.\nKey points...", "parent_text": "I usually start out a few ways. I listen to a few podcasts, read many of the common finance sites, and come on some of the investing subreddits. It\u2019s not advice I\u2019m really looking for but instead names of companies or news surrounding sectors I may not know of or otherwise overlooked. If I find something interesting or attractive I\u2019ll begin my research.\n\nI start by learning about both the company, sector, and product/service they\u2019re offering. I\u2019ll read the history behind it, who\u2019s leading the company, how popular it is, what trends are occurring, and the future outlook of the company and sector. I\u2019ll spend a half hour navigating their website. Look for any news articles or bad press concerning them. I\u2019ve even called companies before just to see how they answer the phone and if there customer service system is friendly, updated, and efficient just to get an idea of how things are operating and how they treat the people calling in.\n\nFor numbers I\u2019ll right off the bat simply google the company and pull up Yahoo or Morning Star go get a quick synopsis of the company. The numbers can sometimes be a little outdated or inaccurate but they\u2019ll give a decent idea of the company and its books. I\u2019ll see what some analysts are saying, how they performed against expectations, and how they fare against competitors.\n\nIf it still looks worthwhile, I\u2019ll move onto reading their actual reports and earning releases. These things can be long and quite boring to read but hold really important figures, views, and statements. This is where you can potentially find some parts that could provide beneficial or advantageous to you.\n\nKnowing the sector and who the company\u2019s competitors are is really important as well. Sometimes you may have research an additional 2-3 companies to get a good feel of how things are. I also try to stay within my range in terms of what I know and understand. Sometimes things like tech or pharmaceutical companies can get really complex that it\u2019s hard to really know how things are going if you don\u2019t truly understand the company or product.\n\nWith all that said, I only do this maybe 1-2 times per month. It\u2019s a lot of work to do and takes a fair deal of time to really learn about and understand a company. Not only that but there are professionals who have already done all that along with computer programs that also take those numbers into consideration and create formulas used by the big investment firms and brokerages. People and programs with more knowledge, skills, and resources than I could ever dream of having. \n\nMost of my portfolio is in index funds and then a little more than a handful in well established companies that have had every inch of their company looked over, audited, and speculated upon. The whole research system I use has only resulted in me making 4, what I would call, unconventional picks that aren\u2019t huge or super well know companies. So far I\u2019m batting 2 for 4 with one of those losers being an absolutely idiotic pick when I was new to investing. The other one hasn\u2019t moved too much but I\u2019ve also only held it for a few weeks so it\u2019s way too early to tell and like most of my holdings is there for the long term.\n\nBest advice I can give is to make sure you understand the company both from a financial standpoint and a product/service standpoint.

It\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen a few weeks from now, let alone a year. You could be buying in at all time highs only to have things crash a few weeks later. The opposite could happen as well with buying low right before a nice market run. By investing a large chunk, you\u2019re indicating that you\u2019re confident in the holding or that you\u2019re willing to hold for the long term regardless of how it performs in the short to medium future.\n\nDollar cost averaging or investing in chunks allows you spread out your risk to volatility a bit. You\u2019ll get in during good times, bad times, stagnant times, etc. but you at least don\u2019t risk putting your money into things all at once and risk having something bad occur just days, weeks, or even months later. Investing in chunks also prevents you from fully committing a huge sum of money if something were to change. For example, you could put 10k down on something like a Marijuana company and be really optimistic about it only to have news come out that new regulations are being passed or that legalization ended up being voted down or delayed. If you already put that 10k in then you have to decide if you\u2019re going to sell or try to wait it out, facing uncertainty and missing out in potential gains in other companies, funds, or sectors if you were to have put your money elsewhere. If you did it in chunks and were say 2k into investing some of your money, you could decide to cut your losses and sell there or wait it out while putting the other 8k into something else.

The wage increase isn\u2019t super crazy and pretty reasonable while fitting with their company beliefs of treating their employees better than competitors. If anything, I think it may be some good PR and help with the goodwill of the public.\n\nThe wage difference from competition may also allow Costco to attract better and more loyal employees who are more likely to stick around as well. It\u2019s not cheap and is time consuming having to look for, hire, and train new employees. I know it\u2019s a department store we\u2019re talking about here but having employees who are happy, friendly, and good workers can do a lot as far keeping customers happy and content with their shopping experience. Hopefully I\u2019m not offending anyone here but think about how miserable, strange, or bad the employees you can sometimes find at Walmart, Kmart, or McDonalds. While I\u2019m not a frequent shopper or member there, whenever I\u2019ve been in a Costco the employees were always friendly, helpful, and normal and the place always seemed clean and well ran. It\u2019s little things like that that can improve a company\u2019s image and both attract and maintain customers.\n\nAlso, as someone in financial project management, wages aren\u2019t the only or always the most expensive part of employing people. It\u2019s the taxes, health insurance, workers comp, unemployment insurance/benefits, training, and gear that gets expensive. Wages are just a piece of the puzzle. \n\nI think Costco probably has 2-3 plans in place after this increase. The first and perhaps most wanted is that the wage increase will keep everyone happy, improve morale and work ethic, and attract strong employees. This will in return provide better shopping experiences and attract new customers. Another plan could be to slightly raise prices on memberships or products but Costco\u2019s books and business plan is pretty sound so I think if they\u2019re implanting this plan they already have a solid idea of how it will play out and know they have some room to play with without raising prices. The last option would be for them to eat the costs after taking a gamble that the goodwill would play out.\n\nIf the business plan and books remain sound and the company continues to grow its revenue then they should be in solid shape even with the wage increase. Costco is pretty well ran so I\u2019m not too concerned about them not planning this accordingly and it may even put pressure on their competitors as well who perhaps may not fare as well with wage increases and won\u2019t be looked at as doing it for the good of their employees but instead because they\u2019re trying to simply keep up with their competitors.
