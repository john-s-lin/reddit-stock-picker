PDUFA date in about 1 month", "submission_text": "Long time lurker, long time biotech investor. Thought I might as well share the research behind my investments. Here is the first one, if people like it I can do a write up on my other investments:\n\nAchaogen\u2019s stock has been unfairly punished following the recommendations offered by the FDA advisory committee. If anything, investors should be assured about the almost guaranteed FDA approval of Plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).\n\n10% \u2013That\u2019s the estimated percent of women with a urinary tract infection in any given year. More conservatively, the number of cases per year is estimated at 150 million, putting it ahead of world-wide cancer cases by a factor of 10 (~14 million), and on par with the flu. Often these are simple to treat, but in the case where the infection involves the upper urinary tract, is recurrent, occurs in men, or in a patient with diabetes or who is otherwise immuno-compromised, the infection becomes a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). This is the pool of patients that Achaogen is seeking to treat with its soon-to-be-approved candidate, Plazomicin.\n\nPathology aside, the cUTI market is too widespread for an accurate assessment of the number of patients. The number of generics already in the market, such as meropenem, also makes an estimate for peak sales difficult. Perhaps the best comparable is the acquisition of The Medicine Company\u2019s cUTI portfolio by Melinta Therapeutics for $270 million in upfront payments and up to 25% in royalties on world-wide sales. An analyst has predicted peak sales for Vabomere, a cUTI treatment from The MedCo\u2019s basket, at $350 million in 2027. This brings forth two important considerations: Vabomere is a combination of meropenem and another drug that prevent bacteria from degrading meropenem. The second consideration is that Plazomicin was tested against meropenem and demonstrated clear superiority. Thus it is likely that this therapy will take a backseat to Plazomicin.\n\nTwo phase 3 trials were performed to evaluate the efficacy of Achaogen\u2019s Plazomicin compared to the current gold-standard treatment. The Phase 3 EPIC trial conformed to the FDA\u2019s guidelines on developing drugs for cUTI, and demonstrated statistical superiority to meropenem. The minimum requirement for a drug approval in this space is proof of non-inferiority. Hence the determination of superiority guarantees FDA approval of Plazomicin, despite a slight uptick in the number of treatment related adverse events.\n\nThe second Achaogen trial, CARE, was conducted to evaluate plazomicin for bloodstream infections using a non-conventional trial format. This trial also demonstrated improved survival, but the low sample size led to an 11-4 recommendation against plazomicin for BSI. Fortunately for value investors, the loss of the BSI indication is not worth the 28% drop seen in the stock following the AdCom results.\n\nFurthermore, a rejection of Plazomicin for BSI treatment is not assured, the AdCom provides only voluntary guidance. The bloodstream approval would be evaluated under a novel FDA program, and the beneficial safety profile of Plazomicin gives the FDA an incentive to approve Plazomicin, if not for any other reason than the fact that few options exist for treating patients with carbapenem-resistant bloodstream infections. Of course, one potential outcome is that the FDA asks for additional data post-approval, draining Achaogen of important financial resources.\n\nFinally, what do the financials at Achaogen look like? The market cap of $500 million doesn\u2019t make AKAO a screaming buy. With only a single approval for Plazomicin, it will have to perform extremely well post-launch, likely requiring a resource-intensive marketing campaign. While there are other candidates in the Acahogen pipeline, these are exceptionally far from approval. Negatives aside, with an almost guaranteed approval of Plazomicin by June 25, investors can expect an almost certain bump in the stock price. Perhaps even a doubling in the next 6 months. With cash equivalents of $144 million and an available credit facility, dilution shouldn\u2019t happen for the remainder of 2018.\n\nShort-term, AKAO looks like a great investment, if for nothing then to capitalize on the hype from an FDA approval for cUTI, and perhaps a bonus approval for BSI. Long-term, the potential looks much less certain, but with considerable upside possible.\n\nAs always, investors should perform their own research and risk assessment before purchasing stocks, and I don't assume any responsibility for losses incurred.\n\nDisclosure: I am long AKAO since 5/4/18\nAlso, the autobot didn't like my links to sources.

Here is the first one, if people like it I can do a write up on my other investments:\n\nAchaogen\u2019s stock has been unfairly punished following the recommendations offered by the FDA advisory committee.

More conservatively, the number of cases per year is estimated at 150 million, putting it ahead of world-wide cancer cases by a factor of 10 (~14 million), and on par with the flu. Often these are simple to treat, but in the case where the infection involves the upper urinary tract, is recurrent, occurs in men, or in a patient with diabetes or who is otherwise immuno-compromised, the infection becomes a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). This is the pool of patients that Achaogen is seeking to treat with its soon-to-be-approved candidate, Plazomicin.\n\nPathology aside, the cUTI market is too widespread for an accurate assessment of the number of patients. The number of generics already in the market, such as meropenem, also makes an estimate for peak sales difficult. Perhaps the best comparable is the acquisition of The Medicine Company\u2019s cUTI portfolio by Melinta Therapeutics for $270 million in upfront payments and up to 25% in royalties on world-wide sales. An analyst has predicted peak sales for Vabomere, a cUTI treatment from The MedCo\u2019s basket, at $350 million in 2027. This brings forth two important considerations: Vabomere is a combination of meropenem and another drug that prevent bacteria from degrading meropenem. The second consideration is that Plazomicin was tested against meropenem and demonstrated clear superiority. Thus it is likely that this therapy will take a backseat to Plazomicin.\n\nTwo phase 3 trials were performed to evaluate the efficacy of Achaogen\u2019s Plazomicin compared to the current gold-standard treatment. The Phase 3 EPIC trial conformed to the FDA\u2019s guidelines on developing drugs for cUTI, and demonstrated statistical superiority to meropenem. The minimum requirement for a drug approval in this space is proof of non-inferiority. Hence the determination of superiority guarantees FDA approval of Plazomicin, despite a slight uptick in the number of treatment related adverse events.\n\nThe second Achaogen trial, CARE, was conducted to evaluate plazomicin for bloodstream infections using a non-conventional trial format.

Here is the first one, if people like it I can do a write up on my other investments:\n\nAchaogen\u2019s stock has been unfairly punished following the recommendations offered by the FDA advisory committee. If anything, investors should be assured about the almost guaranteed FDA approval of Plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).\n\n10% \u2013That\u2019s the estimated percent of women with a urinary tract infection in any given year. More conservatively, the number of cases per year is estimated at 150 million, putting it ahead of world-wide cancer cases by a factor of 10 (~14 million), and on par with the flu. Often these are simple to treat, but in the case where the infection involves the upper urinary tract, is recurrent, occurs in men, or in a patient with diabetes or who is otherwise immuno-compromised, the infection becomes a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). This is the pool of patients that Achaogen is seeking to treat with its soon-to-be-approved candidate, Plazomicin.\n\nPathology aside, the cUTI market is too widespread for an accurate assessment of the number of patients. The number of generics already in the market, such as meropenem, also makes an estimate for peak sales difficult. Perhaps the best comparable is the acquisition of The Medicine Company\u2019s cUTI portfolio by Melinta Therapeutics for $270 million in upfront payments and up to 25% in royalties on world-wide sales. An analyst has predicted peak sales for Vabomere, a cUTI treatment from The MedCo\u2019s basket, at $350 million in 2027. This brings forth two important considerations: Vabomere is a combination of meropenem and another drug that prevent bacteria from degrading meropenem. The second consideration is that Plazomicin was tested against meropenem and demonstrated clear superiority. Thus it is likely that this therapy will take a backseat to Plazomicin.\n\nTwo phase 3 trials were performed to evaluate the efficacy of Achaogen\u2019s Plazomicin compared to the current gold-standard treatment. The Phase 3 EPIC trial conformed to the FDA\u2019s guidelines on developing drugs for cUTI, and demonstrated statistical superiority to meropenem. The minimum requirement for a drug approval in this space is proof of non-inferiority. Hence the determination of superiority guarantees FDA approval of Plazomicin, despite a slight uptick in the number of treatment related adverse events.\n\nThe second Achaogen trial, CARE, was conducted to evaluate plazomicin for bloodstream infections using a non-conventional trial format. This trial also demonstrated improved survival, but the low sample size led to an 11-4 recommendation against plazomicin for BSI. Fortunately for value investors, the loss of the BSI indication is not worth the 28% drop seen in the stock following the AdCom results.\n\nFurthermore, a rejection of Plazomicin for BSI treatment is not assured, the AdCom provides only voluntary guidance. The bloodstream approval would be evaluated under a novel FDA program, and the beneficial safety profile of Plazomicin gives the FDA an incentive to approve Plazomicin, if not for any other reason than the fact that few options exist for treating patients with carbapenem-resistant bloodstream infections. Of course, one potential outcome is that the FDA asks for additional data post-approval, draining Achaogen of important financial resources.\n\nFinally, what do the financials at Achaogen look like? The market cap of $500 million doesn\u2019t make AKAO a screaming buy. With only a single approval for Plazomicin, it will have to perform extremely well post-launch, likely requiring a resource-intensive marketing campaign. While there are other candidates in the Acahogen pipeline, these are exceptionally far from approval. Negatives aside, with an almost guaranteed approval of Plazomicin by June 25, investors can expect an almost certain bump in the stock price. Perhaps even a doubling in the next 6 months. With cash equivalents of $144 million and an available credit facility, dilution shouldn\u2019t happen for the remainder of 2018.\n\nShort-term, AKAO looks like a great investment, if for nothing then to capitalize on the hype from an FDA approval for cUTI, and perhaps a bonus approval for BSI. Long-term, the potential looks much less certain, but with considerable upside possible.\n\nAs always, investors should perform their own research and risk assessment before purchasing stocks, and I don't assume any responsibility for losses incurred.\n\nDisclosure: I am long AKAO since 5/4/18\nAlso, the autobot didn't like my links to sources.

There was also a lot of discussion in terms of 3G and Kraft in regards to cost cutting when they should have been spending on innovation.\n\nI mean, in terms of 3G, this was a very telling interview: \u201cI\u2019m a terrified dinosaur,\u201d he said of the craft brand-driven changes in tastes and in Amazon-driven consumer spending habits that are reshaping the world\u2019s largest consumer companies, including 3G holdings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living in this cozy world of old brands and big volumes,\" said Lemann. \u201cWe bought brands that we thought could last forever,\u201d and borrowed cheap money to do so, he added: \u201cYou could just focus on being very efficient... All of a sudden we are being disrupted.\u201d (Jorge Paulo Lemann Says Era Of Disruption In Consumer Brands Caught 3G Capital By Surprise, https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2018/04/30/jorge-paulo-lemann-says-era-of-disruption-in-consumer-brands-caught-3g-capital-by-surprise/#2658cc481f9b)\n\nHard to say what to do (especially w/o knowing allocation, risk tolerance, etc), I just think that the center aisles of the grocery store are overhated but will probably retain some degree of difficulty for a while; if it isn't changing tastes it's these companies facing rising costs. \n\nI tend to think that I'd be more interested when something is this hated in the short-term, but as someone who is more long-term focused, I just have a lot of questions about what these companies are planning for the years ahead to try and compete against new headwinds - and maybe I'll feel more comfortable if these companies start offering better answers to the questions. Buffett talked about the Kraft issues and so did the CEO during the Berkshire meeting the other day so that was good, but for billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann to say in regards to the situation that, \"I'm a frightened dinosaur\" isn't particularly encouraging. \n\nGIS made the Blue Buffalo purchase which a lot of people criticized as too expensive, but I don't think it was bad. Next time you go to the grocery store, look at the pet aisle. Chances are it looks a lot different than a few decades ago when the choices were like ... Friskies. Petsmart and Petco aren't doing well and more of these premium pet food brands are winding up in the grocery store as grocers want some of the growth from the pet food business. And really, if you're General Mills and your product is already heading to the grocery store as is, Blue Buffalo is just putting more product on the same trucks. \n\nWhat is working at the grocery store is booze and make-up. Much of the rest is a mixed bag. It's not just Big Food, either - PG is having issues.\n\nSo I can't say what to do, but I do think that staples is still overhated and any sort of bright spot in this sector could lift it.

It\u2019s a risky pick to say the least but a company I\u2019m confident in nonetheless and happy to have it in my portfolio.\n\nA great time to jump in would have been a few months ago when they experienced a huge dip but I still think now isn\u2019t too bad of a time to get in, especially if any dips occur. It\u2019s a long story but basically their main product and only source of revenue, a drug called Omidria, was no longer going to be covered by Medicare. Long story short, the government ended up extending coverage for a few years and warned them coverage would stop in the near future for Omidria. The fear was the sudden stop of coverage would eliminate Omero\u2019s only source of revenue and the company either wouldn\u2019t be able to keep running or that they would have to take on unfavorable debt or form of a partnership.\n\nSo why do I like this company? Well, they have this other drug that\u2019s currently in phase 3 trials called OMS721 which treats an extremely rare but brutally devastating and deadly disease called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy where no other means of treatment really exist. These are the type of diseases you hear about where treatment often costs hundreds of thousands of dollars for. OMS721 has also shown promise in treating a few other diseases as well. Throughout clinical trials the drug has shown major promise and many in the industry are very optimistic with it. The drug was also granted orphan and fast track status meaning that the FDA is willing to work with the company and shares the same optimism as well.\n\nOmeros also has a few other interesting drugs in its pipeline but truthfully it\u2019s too truly to tell with these other drugs and like any pipeline drugs they have their work cut out for them. However, OMS721 is seen as a potentially incredible drug that could really help a populace that\u2019s greatly underserved and desperate. If it gains FDA approval, it could be a big money maker for Omeros and help these poor people and save some lives while making shareholders some money.\n\nThe big concern with Omeros would be that they would run out of money and funding with the loss of revenue from Medicare stopping coverage for their Omidria drug which was/is currently their only source of revenue. With this concern now delayed and put off a few years, the hope is a Omeros will have enough time to get approval for OMS721 and get the drug in the market. As you can see, it\u2019s a race against time and this is a bit of wild play here but such is often the nature of pharmaceutical and biotech minded stocks.\n\nFor a more conventional pick, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) seems intriguing right now. Like a lot of healthcare stocks, they have taken a bit of beating these past few months. However, they are an absolutely huge and well established company that should be here for a long time and the demand for healthcare related products/services isn\u2019t going anywhere. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stock that will make you a ton of money or have big gains but it\u2019s a great addition and backbone for any portfolio. It\u2019s one of those stocks that generally goes up slowly but surely over time without too many major up or down swings.

However I think right now it\u2019s far too early and there are little to no options out there in terms of investing/stocks. I have very little experience with currency so I can\u2019t really speak on that end.\n\nThe biggest question is how sincere North Korea actually is in its efforts to reaching peaceful conditions and opening itself up to the outside world. We\u2019ve seen similar moves by them in the past where they fell back on promises or backed out of deals. Will this be another repeat? Will the current US administration be able to successfully negotiate a deal with North Korea, South Korea, and China that works for all parties? What will other countries have to say as well? These are all aspects holding things up and making it too early to tell.\n\nTo put it bluntly, North Korea has a lot of problems right now. They have numerous sanctions held against them, a tightly controlled market, unreliable currency that isn\u2019t really accepted by the outside world, limited resources or resources that aren\u2019t yet easily tapped, are a poor nation, a workforce limited in skills, education, and training, and have some very different conditions/ways of doing things than most of the world. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time, work, and effort to get them up to date and moving with the global economy and market. Some of these things may improve, maybe even fairly fast or greatly, if a deal opens up but there are a lot of issues that need fixing.\n\nAnother concern I would have is putting my money into any companies or sectors over there. Their government has extremely tight control over things and there is a fair deal of corruption in the area as well. We\u2019ve seen how financial figures can be unreliable in places like China and Russia and how companies can suddenly disappear or change leadership in a matter of days in such places. Will this be the case with North Korea? That\u2019s not a place I\u2019d want to be keeping my money in, at least right now anyways.\n\nWithout getting too political, I actually do think some significant and real progress has been made over the past year. I think Kim is genuinely more open than his father and grandfather were and that their country has hit a tipping point where the need for aid and getting more involved in the global market has risen. With some careful and wise maneuvering, I think we could one day see North Korea open itself more and have similar market/economic conditions/principles to a country like China. I just think it\u2019s going to take time and great patience likely along with some hiccups throughout the process.\n\nThey have some natural resources like minerals and metals that could be worth something but the rewards for the risk and cost have to be good enough for outside investors to want to get in the picture. Outside of that, I can\u2019t really think of anything else they have to offer at the moment. There isn\u2019t any technology, services, or unique products or companies over there that look intriguing. If everything works out and opens up, I can\u2019t think of any company I\u2019d want to invest in with them. If anything, the nation will act as more of a reserve of untapped consumers for outside companies to take advantage of. The people of North Korea are poor so it\u2019s also not exactly a profitable area that\u2019s attracting outside companies either. In the end, if anyone is going to profit it\u2019s likely to be a major company from outside North Korea rather than one from within the nation.\n\nIf money and aid is poured into the country then maybe a company specializing in construction and infrastructure building could benefit. There roads, bridges, airports, and buildings all need upgrades or to even be built in the first place. Perhaps, if a outside company is awarded government contracts to build within the nation that could be profitable but that\u2019s still a wild guess.\n\nTo sum it all up, it\u2019s just too early to get involved in anything. There isn\u2019t really anything involving North Korea out there right now that\u2019s available on the market. There are still some serious questions and pieces that need to be answered and worked out. Finally, there is some major instability in terms of political, financial, and economical aspects that could go in any direction. I think we\u2019re moving in a decent direction with the issue but that it will be quite some time before there are legitimate options for the average investor to get into.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "How to invest in currency or anything in North Korea??", "submission_text": "I would pretty much think here soon investing in this country would make millions.

However I think right now it\u2019s far too early and there are little to no options out there in terms of investing/stocks. I have very little experience with currency so I can\u2019t really speak on that end.\n\nThe biggest question is how sincere North Korea actually is in its efforts to reaching peaceful conditions and opening itself up to the outside world. We\u2019ve seen similar moves by them in the past where they fell back on promises or backed out of deals. Will this be another repeat? Will the current US administration be able to successfully negotiate a deal with North Korea, South Korea, and China that works for all parties? What will other countries have to say as well? These are all aspects holding things up and making it too early to tell.\n\nTo put it bluntly, North Korea has a lot of problems right now. They have numerous sanctions held against them, a tightly controlled market, unreliable currency that isn\u2019t really accepted by the outside world, limited resources or resources that aren\u2019t yet easily tapped, are a poor nation, a workforce limited in skills, education, and training, and have some very different conditions/ways of doing things than most of the world. It\u2019s going to take a lot of time, work, and effort to get them up to date and moving with the global economy and market.

Their government has extremely tight control over things and there is a fair deal of corruption in the area as well. We\u2019ve seen how financial figures can be unreliable in places like China and Russia and how companies can suddenly disappear or change leadership in a matter of days in such places. Will this be the case with North Korea? That\u2019s not a place I\u2019d want to be keeping my money in, at least right now anyways.\n\nWithout getting too political, I actually do think some significant and real progress has been made over the past year. I think Kim is genuinely more open than his father and grandfather were and that their country has hit a tipping point where the need for aid and getting more involved in the global market has risen. With some careful and wise maneuvering, I think we could one day see North Korea open itself more and have similar market/economic conditions/principles to a country like China. I just think it\u2019s going to take time and great patience likely along with some hiccups throughout the process.\n\nThey have some natural resources like minerals and metals that could be worth something but the rewards for the risk and cost have to be good enough for outside investors to want to get in the picture. Outside of that, I can\u2019t really think of anything else they have to offer at the moment. There isn\u2019t any technology, services, or unique products or companies over there that look intriguing. If everything works out and opens up, I can\u2019t think of any company I\u2019d want to invest in with them. If anything, the nation will act as more of a reserve of untapped consumers for outside companies to take advantage of. The people of North Korea are poor so it\u2019s also not exactly a profitable area that\u2019s attracting outside companies either. In the end, if anyone is going to profit it\u2019s likely to be a major company from outside North Korea rather than one from within the nation.\n\nIf money and aid is poured into the country then maybe a company specializing in construction and infrastructure building could benefit.
