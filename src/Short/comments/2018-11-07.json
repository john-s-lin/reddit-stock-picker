There will never be a very popular esports following for many phone based mobile games no matter what people say because quite honestly, people who play games recreationally aren\u2019t looking for the same thing people who play mobile games are. Said another way, mobile games do well when they are used for passing time (I.e. 3-5 min to wait for a bus or to take a shit and pass the time); while console/PC games have higher investment because this is where the players are that will be playing the games recreationally or even professionally in some cases, because that increased investment translates to a higher quality game and increased value to consumers in the long run. \n\nWhen was the last time you downloaded any Ketchapp or Voodoo games?

It takes *awhile* to get this business down pat, you should learn supply and demand as that is the *only thing* that moves PA in the live markets. Learn that here: [http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp](http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp) \n\nOnce you've learned supply and demand you need to train your eyes to see it on a chart and see where the imbalance is in price that is normally where the smart money is working and also where the sheeple of the herd are making all their mistakes learn to see both and *you can make money from both*. See the smart money then do *what* they do *where they are doing it from* it honestly doesn't get any easier than that. They can't hide what they are doing on the price chart and it is your job to see them making the path of least resistance and then following them down that path if you wish to make money along with them, go *against* them and you can virtually be assured of losing some or even all of your hard earned money you used as your start up capital.\n\nNext you would need to study money management and become an ***expert*** at it because it is the only thing that will save you from getting **FUBAR** in the live markets. Then you would need to get your trading psyche in order and lose your ego. You may be smart for sure however you are trading in the live market against people and machines who *way* smarter than most of the retail traders who are trading in there, and *they can see you coming a mile away*.\n\nYou'll need to compose a rule based trading plan for the type trading you wish to do what ever that is, swing trading or what ever and you should compose your trading plan *specifically* for the instruments you'll be working in so if you're doing stocks your plan is for that etc. Remember, it has to be *your* plan not what someone else is doing because what works for one trading will most likely *not* work for someone else.\n\nAs a retail trader you need to have an edge over your competition in the live market which is everyone else but *you,* because they are all trying to take your money from you *are you just going to let them do that*?\n\nI hope this helps\n\nGood luck with your trading and investing and remember: Trade smart\u2026***OR JUST DON\u2019T TRADE!***\n\nStock Trading Blogger", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1541621141.0, "submission_id": "9uz7ji", "comment_id": "e98w0q1", "body": "Tough guy here", "score": -2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 9, "submission_ratio": -0.2222222222222222, "submission_title": "Learning", "submission_text": "I want to start getting invested in to stocks and seeing the logistics of it.

Take the remaining 1801.62 and buy some stock in blue chip companies that pay a consistent quarterly dividend and let the dividends reinvest. I have 18 shares in Amazon right now, I bought the first 12 at like $990 a share in 2017 and bought another 6 when it had dropped down below 2000 a few months ago so I made a profit on my first 12, but lost on the other 6 (I wish I had waited, but what can you do?) I plan on holding those 18 shares for now. I know Berkshire Hathaway is a different kind of industry, but the class A stock was at $19 in the 60\u2019s and is now worth $330,000 a share. I\u2019m not sure Amazon could go that far or not, but I\u2019d like to be in on that if it ever did. Historically Amazon is a slow mover with a lot of volatility in between, but that also comes with consistent growth in the end, but it takes a lot of time, patience and detachment over worrying about the day to day, and even month to month or year because it\u2019s not just going to magically pop up and make you a millionaire and if you go in with that expectation you\u2019ll end up pulling out to soon when your expectations aren\u2019t met. So in short if you buy it hold it and pretend like it\u2019s not even there. Unless you\u2019re trying to day trade or make bets that\u2019s a different story it\u2019s not the same as investing. There\u2019s investing which is a long term commitment and then there\u2019s trading which is a short term game.
