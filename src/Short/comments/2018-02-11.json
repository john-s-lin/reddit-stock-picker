Right now, the markets are dipping to where people can shift stocks into bonds.  This could be enough to destabilize the market if quite a few banks have way too much invested in stocks and if they borrowed too much or have not enough liquidity to bear the brunt of this.  A lot of what makes the markets crash is the requirement to hold on to assets for too long in order to make the right return.  In 2008, the spike in oil is what was the sharp pop in the markets.  Right now, it is bonds to stocks because no one wants the government bonds because the returns are too great in the stock market and other areas.  So in order for the government to be able to sell the bonds, they have to drive the price down which means a higher return.  This then gets money managers the opportunity to sell their stock and shift that money over into US bonds.  If too many companies are dependent on stock returns and they have over leveraged in order to max out their gains and satisfy their clients then we should be okay.  I don't see a crash but I think we will see a flat return this year.  The tax reform is going to spike in construction and supplies.  The reason that Cali and NY were taxed higher income taxes is because this will incentivize them to move into a cheaper area spiking construction where they go.  We have about 2-3 more years at least until a crash.  Right now though is the perfect time for a \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" type of money making marketing bs that helps motivate people to profit tremendously until the next downturn.  Granted, I don't know how over leveraged the banks are and that usually causes the crash because they have way more pressure to profit during those times of great gains.  Especially when you have a 50% annual return.  We might but this dip is mostly due to China relations after the CIA found the mole.

If you are referring to Echelon Wealth which released an article yesterday pointing a price of $13, then you should take it with a grain of salt.

If you had believed them, you might have sold it at $14 and lost out a lot of gains, 100% even at the current levels as it has doubled $14. \n\nAdditionally, this article of theirs contradicts their old article because their old article says that they expect it to be $14 around this time of year, but now they are saying it should be $13 today or in the future. They are basically saying that Canopy Growth is shrinking or not growing. The marijuana industry is at its baby stage, and Canopy Growth is a growing company within it, if anything the valuation should go higher as we get further into development of this industry, unless if they can point out some flaws with the company, like a business practice / model that they are employing that is just completely wrong. Instead they used valuation based on multiples. Leading companies have higher multiples, look at any industry, and also you cannot compare the multiple of a company against other companies that might go to zero, because the risk of the smaller players that they go to zero is real. In any new industry not all companies will survive the beginning stages.\n\nI am not saying that the article is not correct, but should read it with a grain of salt. \n\nInvesting in this industry is risky and volatile, its normal for companies to pull back as much as canopy growth did especially in the current stock market environment.

While obviously this is going to change once Canada legalizes, No one really knows by how much. I see them putting a lot of money down in a lot of areas, and while I can see this returning positively it's really hard to say how much of the pool is going to end up being successful for them until well after July 1. \n\nI see this company as the largest risk with potentially the largest reward, but there are other more stable picks that may end up doing just as well or better, like Aurora or Aphria (their business models are much more focused and much more in scope with their actual budget imo). That being said I've been saying since the stock was $6 that Canopy is going to be one of the biggest in the game purely on the awareness they are creating for their brand; They have their hands in everything cannabis-related (even have a sponsorship deal with a music venue) and I do see that being a huge positive for them, again just no one really know by how much.

If you are referring to Echelon Wealth which released an article yesterday pointing a price of $13, then you should take it with a grain of salt. You should not really trust any analyst articles by itself but should use it in conjunction with other information. \n\nIf you look at Echelon Wealth, they predicted that the price should be $14 last year for this period, boy were they wrong because it went up as much as $42. If you had believed them, you might have sold it at $14 and lost out a lot of gains, 100% even at the current levels as it has doubled $14. \n\nAdditionally, this article of theirs contradicts their old article because their old article says that they expect it to be $14 around this time of year, but now they are saying it should be $13 today or in the future. They are basically saying that Canopy Growth is shrinking or not growing. The marijuana industry is at its baby stage, and Canopy Growth is a growing company within it, if anything the valuation should go higher as we get further into development of this industry, unless if they can point out some flaws with the company, like a business practice / model that they are employing that is just completely wrong. Instead they used valuation based on multiples. Leading companies have higher multiples, look at any industry, and also you cannot compare the multiple of a company against other companies that might go to zero, because the risk of the smaller players that they go to zero is real. In any new industry not all companies will survive the beginning stages.\n\nI am not saying that the article is not correct, but should read it with a grain of salt. \n\nInvesting in this industry is risky and volatile, its normal for companies to pull back as much as canopy growth did especially in the current stock market environment.

I agree that sometimes people look too much at certain aspects of a company or sector and not enough on the other aspects that are just as or even more critical.\n\nAs for what I like about the company and stock? Well, I\u2019m definitely long on this pick and there are a few things the company has in its plans that sound promising. They currently have a drug entering phase 3 trials that is used to treat a rare disease called Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and as far as I know they are one of the only, if not the only, company out there working on such a treatment with any degree of notable progress. The disease is truly awful and there isn\u2019t really anything out there right now to help people suffering from it. Despite being pretty rare and hopefully without coming off as uncaring or greedy here, Omeros will be the sole go to for treating this horrific disease. We\u2019ve seen how expensive treatments for rare diseases like these have been in the past so it has potential to be a big money maker even without a large customer base.\n\nTheir big money maker right now is OMIDRIA which is used for treating/correcting cataracts. This product has basically been the sole earner for the company and is continuing to grow, with recent approval and use in numerous countries within Europe. Further, they have their hands in some Stem cell research which I think will one day finally break through and see use in the world of medicine once it can get past the trials and as politics (hopefully) evolve for the better. They also have something in the works for treating opiate and nicotine addiction which could be promising but I\u2019m admittedly hesitant on that one. The latter two items need to be dissected and discussed further before placing too much on them and while I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be leaders in such sectors (Stem cell or addiction treatment), I think they can play an important role in them.\n\nIt may sound silly but the company website, press releases, and staff (I actually called their office before buying just to get a feel) all come off as professional and well ran. Some of these pharm companies can come off as shady or people pushing empty promises. I just don\u2019t get that feel with Omeros. The CEO, Gregory Demopulos comes off as well spoken, presentable, and has no negative history behind him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s Bill Gates or Steve Jobs but from what I\u2019ve seen, I think he\u2019s a more than capable leader.\n\nTheir recent financial releases look alright as well. Nothing special but overall in decent shape. They\u2019re not making money yet but they have reduced losses which is big for any company dealing in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and research related matters. Revenue was up with their OMIDRIA product carrying them. They have some debt but also have some cash on hand as well. Again, not perfect numbers but overall decent for a pharmaceutical company still trying to break into the upper levels of the field.\n\nLike any pharmaceutical company, clinical trials and phases are the big deciding point. They have two items right now in phase 3, a phase that can either move fairly quickly (in terms of approval) or drag big time. The approval or denial of these drugs can make or break a company like Omeros so it will be interesting. I personally wouldn\u2019t have a large part of my portfolio in them but I do like them as one of my more riskier picks. I rely more on index funds so I typically only pick about 20% of my holdings myself in individual company stock with roughly 5% of that number being in fairly risky players like Omeros. Right now, the company is more of a buy and forgot pick. I\u2019ll keep my ears and eyes open for any news related to its clinical progress but I\u2019m not going to stress over it short term as I\u2019m in for the long haul with this company.

Their cash flow is ok, healthy even (they're facing a $400 mil goodwill impairment charge due to a loss of value in their cellular biz. It won't hurt cash flow or dividend but it will appear as a liability on their next earnings report.)\n\nGME is incredibly discounted and incredibly risky. It appears that they can afford their current very high dividend over the next year,  that yield is pushing 11% yield now. They just might suspend the dividend though in order to implement a buy back or acquisition plan they might have. Aggressive stock buy backs at such a low price multiple (4.7) could really help. It is worth noting the absolute *power* of a low priced stock that still has a healthy cash flow. The problem is that so many investors are only in it for the dividend that it would crush the stock if they announce a suspension of dividends without a stellar plan. \n\nThey actually grew their revenue over the holidays by around 10%, but profit was probably flat as their high-margin used game business is shrinking the fastest (and it doesn't appear to be just a low point in a console cycle). The cellular business they had acquired around two years ago fell by 18% when they were expecting growth. Their other acquisition (ThinkGeek which peddles collectibles) is performing well as revenue went up some 20% with very solid margins. Unfortunately it just doesn't move the needle as much as GME needs. They pull in a few percent of their revenue through digital and will never be able to truly pivot to digital since they're just a middle man. It is worth noting that their holiday sales fell around 16% in 2016, so even with the tailwinds they had this quarter (very high consumer spending, release of the Switch) and positive YoY comps they aren't where they were in 2015. There is a chance that the Switch will help slow the decline of used games due to smaller hard drive of the Switch, but most people aren't really holding their breath.\n\nI think the company will survive through 2025 but they will likely never rise above $10 a share after 2020 when digital maxes out at 80% of sales. They will continue to seek acquisition opportunities but buying more retail companies for their retail store probably won't save the day. Dividend will fall as profit margins shrink. Eventually someone like Amazon may acquire them at a small premium when GME's price falls below 5 bucks in mid 2020s. GME's magazine *Game Informer* is surprisingly the 2nd most subscribed to mag in the entire country and I think many companies would love to have it.\n\nAll in all it is a high risk, high reward option that has been on a price decline for a while now. If management pulls off a true surprise with a perfect acquisition or a successful and fundamental pivot away from solely hardware. Unfortunately the CEO who I liked had to leave his position due to health and they just promoted a CEO from within. A 4.7 P/E is extremely low and could be worth a small purchase depending on your invester profile.\n\nI'm not currently invested in GME. I was for a time and I did/do follow the company as you can tell. Remember though, despite it's history of high yield dividend the company is at a sort of cross roads with most roads leading towards shrinking revenue and margins. I am very interested in the company and I think it will be an incredibly interesting case study in the future.

In trading, there's a realization that there is no way to know everything.  There are diminishing returns in trading with the more you know because every move the stock makes you end up running it through all the knowledge you read up on.  However, a lot of it goes contradictory and secondly a lot of it only factors in market participants' behavior over 100 years.  We've been around for millennia.  Also how do you understand irrational behavior?\n\nWhat I would suggest is continue pursuing the physics major and applying it to systematic trading.  One career is to go work at a quant shop.
