It\u2019s battle with Alibaba reminds of Amazon vs eBay if eBay had managed to match Amazon\u2019s past decade success and with both companies operating within a larger country. Basically two companies within the same sector that operate totally differently and with different game plans.\n\nI\u2019ve heard it described on here as being China\u2019s Amazon in that they offer not only consumer to consumer sales but that they also sell directly to consumers as well, similar in a way to how Amazon operates. The company has also attempted to reduce/eliminate counterfeit goods which often plague Alibaba. With a growing middle class and a society who\u2019s people often highly value images, I think this will pay off. The middle class of China alone near rivals the population of the United States which is unbelievable and it\u2019s middle class is expected to only grow.\n\nI also like how they\u2019re taking a similar approach as Amazon with reinvesting a great deal of their money back into themselves. To me this shows more concern and focus on long term growth and success rather than short sightedness and trying to keep shareholders happy today but possibly worse off tomorrow. They are opening up new factories, expanding and exploring incredible delivery systems, improving and tightening consumer/vendor/company relations through unique platforms, implementing a more personalized form of customer support that stresses fast yet efficient customer service, exploring the newest and most efficient forms of technology, and out-pricing competition. They have also been buying smaller companies as well (success on this end has mixed however). They just remind me a lot of Amazon in terms of sharing an ambitious nature and mindset.\n\nThis is going to be a company with a lot of ups and downs, moments of excitement and days of frustration. However, I think over time they will continue moving in the right direction and come out solid in the end. I\u2019m very bullish on China and its growing middle class at the moment. I think they see themselves as fully equal and capable of being a top world leader both politically and economically and will be taking some extreme measures to get there. Without sounding overdramatic, I think China is aiming to take on the US full steam and the 2020s will be their decade. They don\u2019t want to be one of the big guys at the table, they want to be the biggest guy at the table.\n\nAs far as leadership, this is where I\u2019m a little uncomfortable. The founder, Li\u00fa Qi\u00e1ngd\u014dng, is a bit of an unknown to me. Simply put, I don\u2019t know much about the guy and whether he is the right man to be captain of this ship. He doesn\u2019t come off as your traditional company leader and appears more of a wildcard. Yet, sometimes those types of people are the most successful with young, up and coming companies. I\u2019m mixed on him personally, however the companies Walmart and Tencent appear to be confident in the company as evident by their ownership stakes and partnerships with JD. My hope is that the relationship between all parties will prove mutually beneficial.\n\nThe concern with competition is very real. Yet, China has the world\u2019s largest population and a growing economy so there should be enough room for a few giants. As for Amazon? I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be as successful in China as they have been in the US. Between the cultural differences, outsider disadvantage, lack of government support, and differences in mindsets I think it\u2019s not going to be an easy task for Amazon. Very few companies have a true world wide audience and impact and I think this is even more true for something like online retail. Can Amazon have success in China? Absolutely, but I don\u2019t see it being anywhere near what it is here in the US over in China. Alibaba, meanwhile, I think has its sights on expanding into other, more profitable sectors such as cloud/data storage, entertainment, finance, and AI tech which may allow JD some breathing room.\n\nLooking at financials, I see some things I really like. Their market cap is roughly 50 billion, indicating quite a bit of room for growth remaining. Their revenue grew roughly 33% from 2016 to 2017 and profitability is no longer a dream. Debt is fairly reasonable for a young and fast growing company on razor thin margins. I think the recent dips provide a nice buying opportunity for anyone who is interested in jumping in as long as they can stomach some volatility and don\u2019t mind sticking with a company for the long haul.\n\nThe concerns haven\u2019t changed with JD and investors of the company. Can they successfully achieve and maintain profitability without sacrificing what has allowed them to grow? Are they and investors relatively safe from the wrath of the Chinese government if the two don\u2019t see eye to eye? Will they be accepted by countries outside of China or Asia? And perhaps most importantly, can they thrive in an atmosphere full of intense competition? If you ask me, I\u2019m pretty confident in them meeting or achieving most, if not all of these goals in time. You might get some fast, solid returns with this company in short time. Or you may be back at where you started a year or two from now. However I\u2019m confident that longer term, big picture (5-10 years) this is going to be a company in good shape.", "score": 6, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 6, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "JD 52 wk low", "submission_text": "What is your thougth.

I think it will recover over the next few weeks or few months. They actually had decent figures and some nice surprises, despite a few blemishes and the somewhat lack of confidence in the company and sector. However there we a few alarming notes with their earnings report.\n\nIt looks like guidance is lacking confidence and they have certainly have some dead weight and underperforming facets of the company. While revenue grew for the company overall, their brand licensing and MK Wholesale sector fell quite a bit this quarter with MK licensing revenue falling double digits (11%). While they aren\u2019t always the best indicators, it appears analysts aren\u2019t confident either. The stock market and investing as whole has as much to do about future performance and potential as it does with current performance and investors just aren\u2019t very confident in KORS going forward.\n\nDespite yesterday\u2019s reaction, the stock had done well in 2017 and has almost doubled from where it was just a year ago. I ask myself how much more growth is there for them and what are they doing to continue the growth and performance? If you\u2019ve held for awhile I\u2019d take my returns within the next 2-3 months once things hopefully recover a bit from yesterday. If you just got in within the last few days or weeks then I\u2019d do same as well. I can\u2019t really think of a reason to remain with this company unless you\u2019re really confident in it.\n\nI don\u2019t know what price you jumped in at or how long you\u2019ve been holding them but this isn\u2019t a company I\u2019d personally want for the long run however. I think companies like them are going to struggle more as time goes on and trends shift unfavorably to them. We\u2019re likely in the later stages of a bull market and companies like KORS don\u2019t exactly perform well during bear markets and fashion/luxury retail can be brutal during down markets. When that bear market will be is anyone\u2019s guess but if you\u2019re like me and think it\u2019s not too far away then I\u2019d consider getting out of my position.
