For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics.

Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.\n\nShiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\\~ Years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)\n\nThe grey bars mark U.S Recessions. Note 1929, 2001, and 2008.\n\nMEAN: 16.9 (We are currently 53% above the mean, indicating an overvalued market.)\n\nMIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)\n\nMAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)\n\nRANGE: 39.41\n\n**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**\n\nThe Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of measuring value. Instead of comparing a company\u2019s price to earnings, it compares a company\u2019s stock price to its revenues.\n\n|Price/Revenue Per Share|Valuation|\n|:-|:-|\n|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|\n|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|\n|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|\n|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|\n\nThe current for the S&P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.\n\nS&P500 Price to Sales 1955-2006\n\n[https://imgur.com/QbfwTTI](https://imgur.com/QbfwTTI)\n\nS&P 500 by Deciles 1986-Present\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j](https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j)\n\nThe graph above shows the S&P grouped into deciles (each of ten equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.\n\nThe normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.\n\n[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)\n\nThe flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the\n\nlonger maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)\n\nThe Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)\n\nWe are currently in a flat yield curve.\n\n**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

It is compared to previous bull markets. Take it with a grain of salt.*\n\n**For the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU).**\n\nHowever, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its conclusion.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*\n\n**Buffet Indicator Graphs**\n\n(images aren't allowed in r/stonks)? alright I guess ill imgur it but boo.\n\n[https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe](https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe)\n\nThe past 50 years of the Buffet Indicator.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na.

One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*\n\n**Buffet Indicator Graphs**\n\n(images aren't allowed in r/stonks)? alright I guess ill imgur it but boo.\n\n[https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe](https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe)\n\nThe past 50 years of the Buffet Indicator.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na.

The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*\n\n**Buffet Indicator Graphs**\n\n(images aren't allowed in r/stonks)? alright I guess ill imgur it but boo.\n\n[https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe](https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe)\n\nThe past 50 years of the Buffet Indicator.

It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.\n\nShiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\\~ Years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)\n\nThe grey bars mark U.S Recessions.

Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates.

Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)\n\nWe are currently in a flat yield curve.\n\n**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy.

This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*\n\n**Buffet Indicator Graphs**\n\n(images aren't allowed in r/stonks)? alright I guess ill imgur it but boo.\n\n[https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe](https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe)\n\nThe past 50 years of the Buffet Indicator.

It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.\n\nShiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\\~ Years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)\n\nThe grey bars mark U.S Recessions.

Instead of comparing a company\u2019s price to earnings, it compares a company\u2019s stock price to its revenues.\n\n|Price/Revenue Per Share|Valuation|\n|:-|:-|\n|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|\n|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|\n|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|\n|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|\n\nThe current for the S&P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation.

Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.\n\nThe normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.\n\n[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)\n\nThe flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the\n\nlonger maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)\n\nThe Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)\n\nWe are currently in a flat yield curve.\n\n**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates.

Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.\n\nShiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\\~ Years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)\n\nThe grey bars mark U.S Recessions.

Instead of comparing a company\u2019s price to earnings, it compares a company\u2019s stock price to its revenues.\n\n|Price/Revenue Per Share|Valuation|\n|:-|:-|\n|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|\n|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|\n|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|\n|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|\n\nThe current for the S&P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation.

Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates.

Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)\n\nWe are currently in a flat yield curve.\n\n**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently. I will indulge why in a future post.*\n\n**Buffet Indicator Graphs**\n\n(images aren't allowed in r/stonks)? alright I guess ill imgur it but boo.\n\n[https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe](https://imgur.com/D9rxwUe)\n\nThe past 50 years of the Buffet Indicator.

It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.\n\nShiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\\~ Years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1](https://imgur.com/bpsHBQ1)\n\nThe grey bars mark U.S Recessions.

Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates.

The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na.

One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public.

Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&P is the most overvalued it has ever been.\n\n**Yield Curve**\n\nNow we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.\n\nThe normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.\n\n[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)\n\nThe flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn.

Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway.

This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a \u201cFairly Valued\u201d TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.\n\n*The Buffet Indicator has drawn a lot of criticism recently.

Shorter maturities have the same yields as the\n\nlonger maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)\n\nThe Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.\n\n[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)\n\nWe are currently in a flat yield curve.\n\n**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.\n\n[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)\n\nThe failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.\n\n**Dow Theory (the Public)**\n\nDow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn\u2019t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The \u201cMarket Trends\u201d part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.\n\n1. Accumulation Phase\n\na. In the beginning of the bull market \u201cIn the know\u201d investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.\n\n2. Public Participation Phase\n\na. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.\n\n3. Distribution Phase\n\na. The final stage of the bull market. The \u201cin the know\u201d investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur \u201cinvestors\u201d through apps like \\*redacted due to r/stonks rules\\* can now easily speculate with options and margin.\n\n[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)\n\nI believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.\n\nAnyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism is welcome. I will be doing more of these.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nSell everything, the stonk market is gonna crash /s", "parent_text": "Midwest and South (Dallas)", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1534232076.0, "submission_id": "975tfb", "comment_id": "e45txqe", "body": "Thanks for posting this!

The fact they cannot dump their wares on the US for huge profits, coupled with the notion that America wants to start taking care of itself is a scary place for China. Even if they try to punish Apple or other US companies it will still hurt their bottom line.  China is notorious for inflating their numbers, and they cannot do so for much longer. The tariffs being placed on China are not much, yet consider their economy was already slowing down. The tariffs placed on American goods are forcing Americans companies to remodel their overseas business plans. China doesn't have that luxury. There is no market like America to buy their shitty products with such an in demand currency.  China will eventually give in to Trump. However, only in a way that saves face and helps both of them in the long run.  The end of summer is usually a slow time of year for investors.

Immelt wasn't a catastrophe for GE initially - he actually kept the company running and profitable for quite a while after Welch left. Between -00 and -08 you were looking at a \\~8.2 % adjusted earnings growth rate annually.  For a company the size of GE that's actually pretty respectable, and you'd have made a neat profit unless you bought at peak valuation.\n\nThe biggest problem was **overvaluation.** If you bought GE at peak valuation, you paid over 48 P/E in the stock, while the average market valuation was maybe half that. The stock price was not in any way justified by GE's earnings - anyone who neglects doing research when it comes to valuation and fundamentals deserve the cold shower they get when valuations drop back to normal, as they did with GE. The crash back to down 23$ was actually just going back down to fair value. It took til 2009 til the stock actually crashed below fair value and dividend payout ratio.\n\nNowadays...well, i personally wouldn't touch GE with a 10 foot pole. The stock is currently valued at a 12.7 P/E ratio, but the numbers themselves are flawed because there are too many uncertainties to even come up with a proper valuation. You have 17 analysts forecasting a -10.48% earnings growth, but these analysts have missed as often as they've hit the past years, meaning the forecast isn't really trustworthy.\n\nThe current yield of 3.9% is incredibly attractive for a stock like GE, but as people point out, this is **not** your grandfather's GE.  At these valuations, the company can barely keep up the current dividend if profits keep dropping, and that's **assuming** there are no more fucking skeletons in the goddamn closet. \n\nIf the stock continues trading at current P/E levels, you'd be making an 8% annual return on a 3 year period - mostly from dividends. But that's assuming you're not already holding it at a loss - it's assuming you buy at today's prices. **If** GE goes back to fair value according to company earnings, **provided they don't drop any further,** you're looking at an 18% annual return at today's stock price over a 3 year period. The market has traditionally valued GE at a premium, but i don't consider that in any way relevant or feasible in valuation, as they won't climb to that in the near future. \n\nThe market currently loathes GE. Usually when there's blood on the streets, that's the time to buy. As a value investor, that sort of valuation is what i look for in stock picks and investments. Unfortunately GE's history and future is simply too uncertain to make any sort of optimistic case that can be used as groundwork for an investment. \n\n**So, what to do?**\n\nImpossible to tell you. Depends on too many factors. You have a low cost average. Means you can leave the stock  with a relative low cost in order to put it into a better investment. That's what i'd do.

There is still room for growth out there, especially in foreign markets but I'm not sure we'll repeat the run we've had over the last couple years (which can be said of a lot of companies as well).\n\nAmazon has performed incredibly well, both as a company and a stock. Some argue it's pretty overvalued but that's a tough one to truly measure with a company so focused on growth instead of bottom line. The company has continued expanding into different sectors and markets and it's innovative edge over competitors doesn't seem to be dwindling any time soon. Because of this spirit, they have a lot of sectors in development that either still haven't been fully implemented or have reached their full potential. This means there is a lot of potential and money out there for them.\n\nIf I had to pick between only the two of them, going forward I would probably yet hesitantly pick Amazon. I think Apple is priced much better and arguably ran more efficiently but I think Amazon is just growing and expanding so much faster and in so many places that it's hard to see them slowing down any time soon. Amazon is also pretty diverse business wise and are only looking to further that. They have their hands in online retail, entertainment,  data storage, video games, supermarkets, and are working on stepping into healthcare as well. This wide range should, in theory, help lessen any blows during a recession or bear market. I'm not sure what's on the horizon or in the lab right now for Apple but I question just how much more can be squeezed out of them without a new hit product/service. I wouldn't bet against Apple but I do hope they have some new stuff in the works.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has a lot of dependence on their iPhones. The iPhone is an awesome product and one of man's truly great inventions. Apple users are some of more loyal customer bases out there and once they lure you in, it's not common for users to switch to other providers. Apple also has it's hands in other sectors as well but there is no denying the iPhone is king for them. This could be a concern if a new competitor or type of phone related tech arises but I guess we've been saying that for years now to no avail. \n\nOverall, they are both great companies and should have solid futures ahead of them. Yet, I feel Amazon may have a higher likelihood of earning better returns over the next decade so that would be my pick.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 6, "submission_ratio": 0.3333333333333333, "submission_title": "AAPL or AMZN?", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "AAPL or AMZN?
