I also think we'll see many of these companies doing things like crashing, going out, or being brought out by larger companies over the next few years. Who will be left standing is anyone's guess, although from what I can tell there are a few companies right now people are considering the favorites to stick around. \n\nMy big concern right now with the sector is the amount hype surrounding it and how obsessed people are with it from an investing standpoint. A lot of these folks are probably going to learn a hard lesson about why actually understanding and reading a company's financials is so important rather than basing everything off hype, promises, and potential alone.  \n\nOne important thing to remember with something like this is that just because it's a great idea or situation with a lot of money, that doesn't necessarily make it a good investment. There have been things that looked great and promising in the past but didn't end up making wise investments. Weed might be different but I wouldn't be basing a large chunk of my portfolio on the sector personally.

China import to us are what will hurt chinese memory investment in the long run as micron moves away from manufacturing in china. Pricing isnt falling off a cliff either. Just because pricing pulled back after rocketing for the last two years deosnt mean its going to tank and micron is going to start losing money. In a quarter according to some analyst its supposed to retract 5 percent which is nothing compared to last cycle. Any pricing fluctuations will be offset by growing revenue due to the aggressively growing memory market. Growth in iot/datacenter will drive rev growth alone. Pc sales are expected to rise also.

Think in percentages. It doesn't matter if you would only lose a dollar, that can still be 90% which is a very big number.\n\nThat aside, a good general rule is to not get into something unless you specifically know why you are getting into it. Once that reason ceases to be applicable, exit the position.\n\nIf you can't explain objectively why you are in a stock, then get out and put the money in one where you can explain why you are in it. Even if you are terribly wrong in the eyes of others and lack basic fundamental or technical knowledge, you shouldn't be in something if you can't explain why you are in it. Even if it seems like the worst and most wrong reason in the world to someone else, you still need to have that reason for being in it. If you don't have a reason to be in, then get out.\n\nIt is also a good general rule that you never hold onto something that isn't going your way. Get out. People get hung up on a stock going the wrong way. They start by telling themselves that they aren't wrong and it just needs a little time. Then they graduate to saying that the market is wrong and it doesn't make sense and they are still sane as they watch it continue going the wrong way.\n\nFinally they end up telling themselves that they have to stay in because it is so cheap that it has to turn around and go back up. That is a terrible trap. Staying in a stock because it is cheap now is not a reason to stay in it.

Hi everyone,\n\nBefore I get bashed, because of \"you should never sell while it's red\", \"HOLD!\" and etc. I wanted to say that I understand this concept. However, I didn't buy a lot, I just bought 3 stocks, therefore I would not lose a lot of cash if I'd pull out now.\n\nI bought NVDA at 256, in hopes of it reaching ~300$ by the end of the year because of its new graphics card and the recent stocks growth and when it would reach 300$ I would sell it. I don't believe that NVDA will catch up to ~300$ this year anymore and I have a feeling that it will keep going down, because its rapid growth didn't really have a real purpose.\n\nIn case of you wondering why I am thinking about selling it, well I think I could reinvest it somewhere else, maybe not stock related, and since the loss is not too much realistically, I wouldn't feel bad nor it would hurt me.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for correcting my perspective and all the tips - greatly appreciated!", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": -0.42857142857142855}, {"time": 1539665851.0, "submission_id": "9og4c9", "comment_id": "e7uqwmx", "body": "I have been used to NVDA ever since I bought at $55, keep adding them whenever I have money, bought today too.

SQ kept going down another 30 bucks before ricocheting off of 65.\n\n- I use UNP as a bank account substitute but had a stop on it.

Plus be alert when they get triggered. Look at the chart. Look like a blip, or is the stock headed for a nosedive? Blip = buy back in. Nosedive = sit on cash for a little bit and see what happens.
