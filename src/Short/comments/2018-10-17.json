Despite that, I remain cautiously optimistic going forward. The company, if we can actually believe the financials (a fairly big \u201cif\u201d which admittedly sucks having to state) looks pretty good and it\u2019s business plan is fairly similar to how platforms like Netflix and Hulu operate that have had tremendous success over the past few years. Unfortunately the trade war talks, tariffs, international tensions, and China\u2019s gloomy economic outlook hasn\u2019t helped and has taken its toll on the company and many others, whether rightfully so or not.\n\nNow onto your question, why haven\u2019t we heard as much about IQ and why don\u2019t we see the type of optimism we saw a few months back? I\u2019d say the biggest factor is that it was simply the hot stock of the week for awhile there and after seeing some pretty great gains it attracted a lot of attention. People were jumping in left and right hoping to find a high risk high reward company that was suddenly being talked about by everyone as the Chinese Netflix.

Despite that, I remain cautiously optimistic going forward. The company, if we can actually believe the financials (a fairly big \u201cif\u201d which admittedly sucks having to state) looks pretty good and it\u2019s business plan is fairly similar to how platforms like Netflix and Hulu operate that have had tremendous success over the past few years.

For example, the tariffs more or less have little to no impact on a company like IQ yet they suffered just like any other Chinese company from these things. When a recession strikes, it usually brings down most of the market even if it\u2019s not warranted. Investors, both domestic and foreign, will see a recession, get fearful, and either pull their money or avoid investing in country.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to speculate on stuff like this.

What is the cumulative rate of return?\nA: A rate of return is the increase (or decrease) of your total account value due to investment-related sources such as market appreciation (or depreciation) or investment income (interest and dividends). The change in your total account value expressed as a percentage is commonly referred to as total rate of return.\n\n8. What is an annualized rate of return?\nA: An annualized rate of return is the compound average annual return of cumulative returns exceeding a year or more. This is not a simple average where the sum of monthly cumulative returns, for example, is divided by the number of months comprising the selected measurement periods. It is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geometric average\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which takes into consideration the effects of compounding. Returns can only be annualized when they exceed more than a year of data.\n\nhttps://www.td.com/ca/webbroker/help/rateofreturn.html#factors", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 14, "submission_ratio": 0.07142857142857142, "submission_title": "Why is it so hard to see total return from an investment?", "submission_text": "I have a question about price charts.

I think Google has to worry about margins coming down more than losing market share. Youtube and google search are not getting any less popular but the cost of the ads are increasing because they have to partner with more companies to maintain traffic. People are connecting with the internet in different ways now and that means google has to work with companies like apple to ensure that google search maintains its dominant position. The ad revenue is increasing but it just costs a little bit more per click because people dont just open up browsers on the internet anymore. They are watching videos, using apps, using siri etc. ", "score": 0, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Google way oversold", "submission_text": "Why is this company being lumped in with Facebook-- where people go on the internet to waste time.

When RSUs \\*vest\\*,  this income is treated as ordinary income (same as salary, bonus, etc).  This is completely independent of whether you sell them immediately or not.  So you owe taxes on this income.  The amount you owe depends on your total annual income and deductions and all that, (again) just like your salary.\n\n\\- OP\u2019s example:  100 shares vest, let\u2019s say $45/share.  $4500 added to your W2 as income for that year, just like a bonus or CR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) When your RSUs vest, Company \"withholds\" some of these shares as an ESTIMATED payment on the tax that is due.  The amount they withhold is regulated and you don't have a choice - but there's no guarantee that it's the EXACT correct amount you'll owe at the end of the year -- just like the amount withheld from each paycheck is not an EXACT amount of your tax liability.  When you file your end of year taxes, all the tax liabilities, deductions, and credits are added up and you either have more tax due or a refund.\n\n\\- OP\u2019s example:  42 shares withheld @ $45 = $1890 withheld and sent to the IRS on your behalf, and included on your W2 along with any other withholding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) When you dispose of (generally \"sell\") the vested shares, you have either a capital gain or a capital loss.  This is treated just like any other stock transaction for tax purposes.\n\n\\- OP\u2019s example:  58 shares are now in your brokerage account, just as if you had purchased them on your own @ $45 each.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 2.0, "submission_title": "I participate in my company's RSU stock plan.
