Make sure a company isn\u2019t investing into things it doesn\u2019t understand. Find companies that focus on what they\u2019re good at (niche).\n\nYou know stuff before the Wall Street investors. Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what\u2019s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. \n\nIt\u2019s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number. As Acquirers Multiple would say, be different, Zig when others Zag. \n\nJust because a company works in one state, doesn\u2019t mean it will work somewhere else. Sometimes waiting to see if their growth will be the same on more of a national level isn\u2019t a bad idea at all. \n\nThe investors relations office isn\u2019t just for the pros. Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you\u2019re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, \u201cWhat are the positives this year and what are negatives?\u201d\n\nLook at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. \n\nCheck the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? \n\nYou want a PE ratio that\u2019s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =&amp;lt;1)\n\nDebt determines the survivability of a company. There\u2019s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it\u2019s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can\u2019t be forced to immediately repay it.  \n\nDividend paying is good! Companies that don\u2019t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn\u2019t have a dividend during downturns. \n\nLower debt is still more important than dividend paying. \n\nBook value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won\u2019t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. \n\nThere can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it\u2019s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That\u2019s a hidden asset. \n\nCash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don\u2019t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at \u2018free cash flow\u2019 for this reason. \n\nYou don\u2019t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )\n\nGrowth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. \n\nRecheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)\n\nFirst phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.\n\nExample is $ADR , the beer company. They own over 40% of beer market. They are a phase 3 business. They must find innovation. \n\n**FINAL CHECKLIST:**\n\nP/E needs to be compared at industry level. Is it lower or higher? \n\nInstitutional ownership preferably low!\n\nInsider buys and buybacks are positive signs!\n\nAre their earnings consistent?\n\nWhat is their debt to equity ratio?\n\nWhat\u2019s their free cash position?\n\nHave dividends always been paid and routinely raised?\n\nIf you\u2019re holding long term make sure to check long term growth rate and how they do during market declines and recessions. \n\nCyclical companies you must pay attention to the inventory levels to gauge what part of cycle they are in. \n\nCheck for fast growers that their supposed enriching product is a big part of their actual business. Example is Hanes had a supper popular leggings company. Unfortunately it was a small part of their full product range!\n\nCheck to see if a company has room to grow. How does the PE ratio compare to the earnings growth?\n\nDo they have enough cash to come out positive in a liquidation?\n\nBig companies make small moves. Small companies make big moves. Look for smaller companies that are already profitable and have a proven concept. \n\nStay out of \u2018hot\u2019 stocks in hot industries. Invest in out of favor, dull mundane companies. \n\nThe ideal investments are companies with niches. Moderate fast grower with 20-25% growth are ideal investments. \n\nWhen checking depressed stocks. Look for ones with superior financial situations. Stay away from ones with a lot of debt. \n\nLook for companies that consistently buy back their own shares. Insider buying is a positive sign. \n\nA watched stock never boils!\n\nSpend more time or as much time looking for a stock as you would for your own refrigerator\n\n*I hope this helped.

Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what\u2019s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. \n\nIt\u2019s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number.

Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you\u2019re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, \u201cWhat are the positives this year and what are negatives?\u201d\n\nLook at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. \n\nCheck the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? \n\nYou want a PE ratio that\u2019s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =&amp;lt;1)\n\nDebt determines the survivability of a company. There\u2019s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it\u2019s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can\u2019t be forced to immediately repay it.  \n\nDividend paying is good! Companies that don\u2019t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn\u2019t have a dividend during downturns. \n\nLower debt is still more important than dividend paying. \n\nBook value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won\u2019t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. \n\nThere can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it\u2019s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That\u2019s a hidden asset. \n\nCash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don\u2019t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at \u2018free cash flow\u2019 for this reason. \n\nYou don\u2019t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )\n\nGrowth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. \n\nRecheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)\n\nFirst phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.\n\nExample is $ADR , the beer company. They own over 40% of beer market.

If unsure the good question always is, \u201cWhat are the positives this year and what are negatives?\u201d\n\nLook at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. \n\nCheck the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? \n\nYou want a PE ratio that\u2019s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =&amp;lt;1)\n\nDebt determines the survivability of a company. There\u2019s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it\u2019s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can\u2019t be forced to immediately repay it.  \n\nDividend paying is good! Companies that don\u2019t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn\u2019t have a dividend during downturns. \n\nLower debt is still more important than dividend paying. \n\nBook value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won\u2019t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. \n\nThere can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it\u2019s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That\u2019s a hidden asset. \n\nCash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don\u2019t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at \u2018free cash flow\u2019 for this reason. \n\nYou don\u2019t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )\n\nGrowth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. \n\nRecheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)\n\nFirst phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing. This is where you make most money) third phase is when the company needs to innovate to keep making more money.\n\nExample is $ADR , the beer company. They own over 40% of beer market. They are a phase 3 business. They must find innovation. \n\n**FINAL CHECKLIST:**\n\nP/E needs to be compared at industry level. Is it lower or higher? \n\nInstitutional ownership preferably low!\n\nInsider buys and buybacks are positive signs!\n\nAre their earnings consistent?\n\nWhat is their debt to equity ratio?\n\nWhat\u2019s their free cash position?\n\nHave dividends always been paid and routinely raised?\n\nIf you\u2019re holding long term make sure to check long term growth rate and how they do during market declines and recessions. \n\nCyclical companies you must pay attention to the inventory levels to gauge what part of cycle they are in. \n\nCheck for fast growers that their supposed enriching product is a big part of their actual business. Example is Hanes had a supper popular leggings company. Unfortunately it was a small part of their full product range!\n\nCheck to see if a company has room to grow. How does the PE ratio compare to the earnings growth?\n\nDo they have enough cash to come out positive in a liquidation?\n\nBig companies make small moves. Small companies make big moves. Look for smaller companies that are already profitable and have a proven concept. \n\nStay out of \u2018hot\u2019 stocks in hot industries. Invest in out of favor, dull mundane companies. \n\nThe ideal investments are companies with niches. Moderate fast grower with 20-25% growth are ideal investments. \n\nWhen checking depressed stocks. Look for ones with superior financial situations. Stay away from ones with a lot of debt. \n\nLook for companies that consistently buy back their own shares. Insider buying is a positive sign. \n\nA watched stock never boils!\n\nSpend more time or as much time looking for a stock as you would for your own refrigerator\n\n*I hope this helped.

It\u2019s very dry cut but it has helped me out and I believe it can help newer investors!\n\n**Words of Wisdom Chapters 1-15**\n\nStay away from DiWORSEification. Make sure a company isn\u2019t investing into things it doesn\u2019t understand. Find companies that focus on what they\u2019re good at (niche).\n\nYou know stuff before the Wall Street investors. Possible stock purchases are in front of you. Look around and pay attention to your surroundings. Look locally. Try products. Get a taste when you can. Know people in industries and ask them what\u2019s selling or doing well. Ask friends and family. \n\nIt\u2019s good to have the institutional ownership at a lower number rather than a higher number. As Acquirers Multiple would say, be different, Zig when others Zag. \n\nJust because a company works in one state, doesn\u2019t mean it will work somewhere else. Sometimes waiting to see if their growth will be the same on more of a national level isn\u2019t a bad idea at all. \n\nThe investors relations office isn\u2019t just for the pros. Get questions ready and studied, then make a call to the company you\u2019re interested in buying. Two good questions. If unsure the good question always is, \u201cWhat are the positives this year and what are negatives?\u201d\n\nLook at current assets and take the cash figure and add it-to the marginal securities. This gives you the total overall cash position. Socking away money is a sign of prosperity. \n\nCheck the debt. Lowering debt is also a sign of prosperity. When cash is increasing and debt is decreasing is what we want. Our cash - debt is our NET cash position. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know what each product means to the company. How much of their profits come from this product? \n\nYou want a PE ratio that\u2019s half the growth rate. This is good. PE at twice growth rate is very negative. (PEG =&amp;lt;1)\n\nDebt determines the survivability of a company. There\u2019s two types. Bank debt and funded debt. Bank is worse because it\u2019s due on demand. Bank debt is due sooner, also he can ask for it whenever he sees trouble. Funded is best debt. As long as interest is being paid, the business can\u2019t be forced to immediately repay it.  \n\nDividend paying is good! Companies that don\u2019t pay dividends can waste money on diWORSEification. Dividends create a positive aura. It also stops stocks from falling as much if they didn\u2019t have a dividend during downturns. \n\nLower debt is still more important than dividend paying. \n\nBook value understates or overstates actual value because a company realistically won\u2019t be able to sell assets for as much as balance sheets show. But remember that the debt in the sheets will always, always beed to be paid. \n\nThere can be hidden assets such as assets not being projected by interest gain. Company might buy gold at $500 five years ago. Now it\u2019s worth $700. They will still show it on balance sheets as $500. That\u2019s a hidden asset. \n\nCash flow is amount of money in result of doing business. Look for companies that don\u2019t need to spend as much cash to stay competitive. Cash flow needs to be looked at \u2018free cash flow\u2019 for this reason. \n\nYou don\u2019t want inventory buildup. Inventory growing faster than sales is a bad sign. Two types of inventory reports on balance sheets. LIFO AND FIFO ( last in first out. First in first out )\n\nGrowth is not synonymous with expansion.  Earnings is the most important metric for growth. \n\nRecheck companies story every couple months. 3 phases of a growth company. Startup phase, rapid expansion ,and mature phase (saturation phase)\n\nFirst phase is riskiest, Where stock is growing and finding its ground. Second phase is when they are really performing.

But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention \u2014 first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that's where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle \"the Enterprise of Things.\" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom\nIt's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 \u2014 and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021.\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors \u2014 companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others \u2014 have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know \u2014 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure.

Revenue has declined every year since 2011 \u2014 and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021.\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors \u2014 companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others \u2014 have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know \u2014 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past.

Chen should know \u2014 he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure.

I think your issue here is you\u2019re not quite understanding how publicly traded companies and IPOs work. \n\nOne of the biggest reasons companies become publicly traded is to raise money. They can also offer/sell additional shares to bring in more money down the line as well. However doing this typically decreases the price of shares as they can become diluted. Once the company has become public and things have more or less settled, the company itself doesn\u2019t really benefit in terms of getting any more money from the stock\u2019s performance. Instead it\u2019s the shareholders that do. Think of it kind of like a one time move that can bring in large sums of money to really get things moving for a company.\n\nCompanies also often have grace periods where original share holders and/or those within company holding shares can\u2019t sell their shares. This means the CEO can\u2019t immediately sell all their shares the moment a company becomes publicly traded.\n\nA publicly traded company is just that, it\u2019s a company that isn\u2019t privately owned. People buy shares of the company and in return now own a percentage of the company. The goal is to overtime return the money (and then some) to shareholders by things like dividends or the stock price increasing so the individual can sell their shares at a later date for more money.\n\nThis is why you sometimes hear about how companies are only worried about shareholders and act too shortsighted. They have to keep these people happy and if leadership loses the confidence of shareholders, especially those with great stakes in the company and that have a lot of influence, they will likely be fired. \n\nSome companies don\u2019t want to be traded publicly. The original founder or owner may want full control of the company, they may not want to deal with all the additional oversight and headaches of being publicly traded, and such. There are pros and cons in each scenario but an IPO can really get the ball moving and help relatively young but up and coming companies be able to grow and expand by having the influx of cash into the company.", "score": 8, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 2.0, "submission_title": "Basic Question About What Happens With An IPO", "submission_text": "**edit:** So /u/PAdogooder helped me figure out exactly what it is that's bothering me.

And if a bunch of people sell, that fucks with the interest rates you can get when you need loans?", "parent_text": "Ok, let\u2019s use a simple story to explain an IPO. \n\nJohn makes and sells widgets. He\u2019s a really good widget guy and he owns 100% of his widget business. He wants to expand, but to do that, needs money for more widget widgets, and even some widget widget widgets. \n\nLet\u2019s say that John has been paying himself all the profits of the company on a monthly basis, so the business has very little cash. He could save some of those profits to be able to expand in a few years, or he could sell some equity of his company privately for cash now. \n\nSo let\u2019s say that his company sells a million widgets a year for a dollar apiece. There are many options available, but John and Abe, a venture capitalist, agree that 1x revenue is fair and the company is worth 1 million dollars. \n\nHere\u2019s the part that confuses people: Abe wants to own 50% of John\u2019s company, so a lawyer draws up a sales contract, and defines how many shares in that company\u2019s ownership exist. Let\u2019s say they agree on 1,000. Abe buys 500 shares for 500,000 and that money goes into the business. \n\nSo, before, the company had no money in the bank and was worth $1m. Now, it is still worth all that AND there\u2019s $500k in the bank. Add that up and it\u2019s a company worth 1.5 million dollars. \n\nThis concept is call \u201cpremoney\u201d and \u201cpost-money\u201d, but what\u2019s important is that Abe and John own shares in the company, which is more specific than a contract defining \u201cAbe owns 50% and John owns 50%\u201d. \n\nSo the widgets expand and go crazy. The company increases in value, to a billion dollars. They want to expand into widget raw material verticals, so they decide to IPO.  \n\nThat lawyer realizes it\u2019s impractical to IPO with only a thousand shares to trade, so first they revise that number through a split. John\u2019s widget shop now has ownership broken into 10 million shares worth $100 each. John owns 5 million and Abe owns 5 million- they both own 50%, it\u2019s just more shares worth less apiece adding up to the same total. \n\nNow, they decide they need to raise 100 million dollars.
