In fact, most people lose money their first year of trading. Most people that make it BIG completely wipe out their first account before they become consistently successful.\n\nIf you plan to trade, develop a strategy and develop a very mechanical trading plan. Risk management will be the key. No trader can make money without proper risk management. Accept the fact that you will have many losses. It's not about being right or wrong, but how much money you make when you're right and much money you lose when you're wrong. As a trader, whether or not you think you're right doesn't matter, the market is always right so learn to be humble and accept whatever the facts are. Don't get caught up in \"what you believe\" the market should do next because the market doesn't give a single fuck about what you believe.

The regulation for companies listed on AIM is often referred to as being light touch regulation, as it is essentially a self-regulated market where nomads are tasked with adhering to the broad guidelines. There have been cases of nomads failing to do their duties, as it were, and AIM is not a stranger to outright fraud (to be fair, no major exchange is either). As a result, AIM tends to attract sophisticated and institutional investors who have the risk appetite and resource to perform independent due diligence.

Some US states are bigger than countries.\n\nStability: For all the craziness and flaws of our government, we still have a pretty stable system in place. We haven\u2019t experienced things like a civil war, military coup, wars with our neighbors, or famine ever or in a long time. The stability helps companies grow, attracts outsiders, and maintains a healthy consumer base. Imagine how difficult it is doing business in a place like Iraq or Congo where wars, famines/droughts, or government changes occur frequently.\n\nFriendly Business Environment: The US is pretty friendly to businesses and business owners. Taxes are lower than a lot of developed countries. People are often encouraged to start their own businesses. The American Dream is preached that anyone can start their own business and become rich if they work hard enough, have a good idea, and have a little luck. Regulations are pretty middle of the pack.\n\nMarket Attractiveness: The US is an attractive place to people living outside it. Some of smartest, most talented, and highly skilled people come from all over the world to practice or do business in the US. Some countries have huge problems with brain drain while the US has managed to attract top level individuals over the years. This helps fuel innovation and development.\n\nWeather/Climate: The US has a pretty reasonable climate. It\u2019s not a frozen, cold area where no one wants to live or where certain businesses are impractical. It\u2019s not too hot or dry to the point where things like droughts plague the area. Things like massive earthquakes, Tsunamis, Volcano eruptions, and Massive hurricanes are all either nonexistent or fairly rare. There are some parts of the US that deal with these problems but as a whole the US is pretty fortunate for its moderate climate and weather.\n\nPower of US Dollar: This is admittedly a bit out of my league but the US dollar virtually acts as a second currency for much of the world. It\u2019s tied to things like oil and commodities and in many countries is valued more by citizens than their own country\u2019s currency. There is a lot riding on the US dollar and it\u2019s influence stretches across the globe. The petrodollar is a huge aspect on this end and a very powerful card held by the US.\n\nMilitary: The US has the strongest military in the world. It\u2019s a huge industrial complex where billions of dollars are spent running and maintaining it each year. The military also allows the US to direct influence across the globe. It also keeps the US safe from any sort of legitimate threats and thus stability.\n\nReputation: The US has a pretty good reputation in terms of doing business. It\u2019s pretty reliable when it comes to paying off debts. Americans are some of the biggest consumers in the world. Basically, companies know doing business in or with the US has a ton of potential and reliable.\n\nAmerican Mindset: Americans love to consume. People are always fighting to keep up with the Jones\u2019. People spend thousands each year on luxury items, the newest gadgets, expensive hobbies, eating out, etc. Americans also have a tendency to spend rather than save. While it might not be the best thing for the long run, the American mindset certainly helps fuel the economy to a degree.\n\nEmployment: America ranks pretty well in terms of employment and productivity. Some countries really struggle with this, having numbers in the double digits for unemployment be something regular.\n\nCompanies within the US. The US is home to many of the largest companies in the world. These companies bring in an incredible amount of money into the country while providing a service or product to consumers. They also employ millions of individuals helping keep the cycle of money moving.\n", "score": 11, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 14, "submission_ratio": 0.7857142857142857, "submission_title": "Why does the U.S. economy grow so much faster than the world economy?", "submission_text": "I keep looking at U.S. ETFs and seeing some pretty killer growth.
