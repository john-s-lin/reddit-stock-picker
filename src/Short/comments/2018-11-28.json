Based on multiple companies slashing guidance and trade war starting to hurt multiple businesses and interest rate increases (while not in quite dangerous territory yet) point to a down turn coming relatively soon. A bunch of firms have already said S&P will remain flat this year, while many others have projected up to a 2% decrease.\n\nAlso, most likely going to enter a bear market rather than a recession.

Now you have a 10% correction like the one earlier this year and people are: \"IS IT 2008 AGAIN!?!?\"\n\nPeople who seem to want to sidestep any sort of market distress. Optimally, buy when it doesn't *feel* good to do so, not when it does.  You mention January - in January the indexes were massively technically overbought and February saw the biggest swing in momentum in history as the market went from way overbought to way oversold. I don't think that there was any macro issue that caused that decline, it was simply that everyone was on one side of the boat and there was no way that a 7% gain before January was even over was going to be sustained. Jan and then Feb is what it looks like when everyone is on one side of the boat and then rushes to the other side.\n\nHave some actual long-term view in regards to the things you invest in, keep some cash on the sidelines, reinvest dividends and rather than fleeing any time that the market has any rocky periods, actually look around to see if there are any opportunities. If you want to raise some cash into strength, fine, but I've seen for a few years now on here people who just seem to be looking for an excuse to sell everything. If you're constantly looking for a reason to sell everything then maybe don't invest.\n\nThere will be a recession, we are late innings. However, I see this view on Reddit that every recession is a crash and a Global Financial Crisis when that's just not the case. I do think that people who have a long-term view have been given a number of opportunities over the last month or so where many high quality names are 20-30-40+% off highs. \n\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Is anyone selling this bounce?", "submission_text": "I'm trying to figure out if this is a rebound from lows or a dead cat bounce or short-term rally.

That makes no sense. \n\nI wasn\u2019t suggesting the products they\u2019ve released are total game changers, but they\u2019re new products for Apple that are well designed and extremely popular (minus the HomePod I believe).

Ford hasn\u2019t even revolutionized the entire industry since they created the assembly line, they\u2019ve been totally useless ever since, right?

Right now, the drug is, and has been for decades, being distributed to a few hundred people for the cost of postage by Jacobus. Many others are paying a few hundred per month.\n\nSince jacobus has invested who knows how many millions in testing etc, the FDA has hijacked jacobus' right to manufacture and distribute their own drug, and are giving catalyst monopoly rights. This orphan program is supposedly made to spur innovation, but instead, this company and the FDA is abusing it to make a ton of money. some people will never be able to afford it- other people are going to be wiped out financially. Most people who use it can't live a normal life without it, and now they are suddenly going to have to give this company everything they have, unless they happen to be paying a lot for insurance that covers it- in which case the insurance company will be footing the bill, which doesn't end their- everyone pays for that in the long run.\n\nI guess this has been going on for a long time- before this, i didn't know much about the pharma business, the fda etc- from a newbies viewpoint who knows someone with LEMs, this looks like legalized profiteering. It seems kind of sick to me that anyone can invest in these stocks and get their little piece when it's going to be doing this to people. \n\nOther people that have written similar things have been accused of fear mongering- but these companies have a history of doing this to people. Of course since it's generating huge cash flow, it's ok, and easy for most people to invest without finding out about the details.\n\nAnd the FDA- they seem to have been corrupted themselves- look at the essure story- the head of the FDA at the time had invested in essure early on, and fast tracked it's approval process, then the medical device mangled people's insides and made life a gory process. It's disturbing that happened to so many people, and you never hear about it unless you go looking. there are many more like it. This whole thing is a racket- people ought to be ashamed of themselves- but they never will, they'll likely make lots of money instead, while many people who previously were able to get the drug for very little will be cleaned out, if they had anything to start with.\n\nThe drug costs next to nothing to mfg. the only difference that i can find between this new drug and the jacobus version is the jacobus version needs to stay refrigerated, and the new one doesn't. Well, i read they also made a label for the bottle with more info. I can see how a company has a huge cost to get FDA approval , but charging people even 20k/year seems excessive by about 19k for a drug that costs nothing to mfg.\n\nPeople go on and on about safety and mfg defects- i haven't seen any problems in the two years a relative has been using it, and i haven't heard of any in the several decades it's been around. From what they've stated, Catalyst inferred they plan on charging people somewhere between $100,000 and $300,000 per year (likely to start far lower to keep people from complaining too much at first). But hey, it's legal. This is going to make people say screw the FDA and start looking for ways to import 3,4DAP from abroad- f* the drug import laws if this is how they are going to screw people.\n\nFor people who need the meds, this is a tax on life.

This is the first FDA approval of a treatment for LEMS.\n\n\u201cThere has been a long-standing need for a treatment for this rare disorder,\u201d said Billy Dunn, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cPatients with LEMS have significant weakness and fatigue that can often cause great difficulties with daily activites.\u201d\n\nIn people with LEMS, the body\u2019s own immune system attacks the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and muscles) and disrupts the ability of nerve cells to send signals to muscle cells. LEMS may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, but more commonly occurs in patients with cancer such as small cell lung cancer, where its onset precedes or coincides with the diagnosis of cancer. The prevalence of LEMS is estimated to be three per million individuals worldwide.\n\nThe efficacy of Firdapse was studied in two clinical trials that together included 64 adult patients who received Firdapse or placebo. The studies measured the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (a 13-item physician-rated categorical scale assessing muscle weakness) and the Subject Global Impression (a seven-point scale on which patients rated their overall impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well-being). For both measures, the patients receiving Firdapse experienced a greater benefit than those on placebo.  \n\nThe most common side effects experienced by patients in the clinical trials were burning or prickling sensation (paresthesia), upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, elevated liver enzymes, back pain, hypertension and muscle spasms. Seizures have been observed in patients without a history of seizures. Patients should inform their health care provider immediately if they have signs of hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, hives, itching, fever, swelling or trouble breathing.\n\nThe FDA granted this application Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. Firdapse also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.\n\nThe FDA granted the approval of Firdapse to Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation\u2019s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.", "parent_text": "Yea I see what you\u2019re saying.....what\u2019s your sell limit in this one?", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1543471093.0, "submission_id": "a1e0g7", "comment_id": "eap5qe4", "body": "I love my tobacco stocks!", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 3.0, "submission_title": "$PM", "submission_text": "In order to not have as many  Volatile stocks my portfolio would purchasing more Philip Morris shares be a sound  investment?", "parent_text": "$PM In order to not have as many  Volatile stocks my portfolio would purchasing more Philip Morris shares be a sound  investment?", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 3.0}, {"time": 1543540398.0, "submission_id": "a1e0g7", "comment_id": "ear8e0f", "body": "I would do a mix of MO & PM .... probably 65% MO (if you buy below $57) and 35% PM", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "$PM", "submission_text": "In order to not have as many  Volatile stocks my portfolio would purchasing more Philip Morris shares be a sound  investment?", "parent_text": "$PM In order to not have as many  Volatile stocks my portfolio would purchasing more Philip Morris shares be a sound  investment?", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1543471156.0, "submission_id": "a1e0g7", "comment_id": "eap5siz", "body": "Me too!", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 3.0, "submission_title": "$PM", "submission_text": "In order to not have as many  Volatile stocks my portfolio would purchasing more Philip Morris shares be a sound  investment?", "parent_text": "I love my tobacco stocks!", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1543539257.0, "submission_id": "a1e0g7", "comment_id": "ear73mn", "body": "I love to short them too!", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "$PM", "submission_text": "In order to not have as many  Volatile stocks my portfolio would purchasing more Philip Morris shares be a sound  investment?", "parent_text": "Me too!", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 0.3333333333333333}, {"time": 1543420812.0, "submission_id": "a16u2o", "comment_id": "eanbkbc", "body": "I\u2019ll never forget in 2008 when I was watching CNBC a GM or Ford executive (can\u2019t remember which company) came on and said well sales in the US aren\u2019t great but we are looking towards Europe as things look better there.

For automakers, that means that leased vehicles to take a hit due to higher than forecasted depreciation.\n\nThat's bad news for domestic manufacturing as it means that there's less demand to produce cars, and thus the turnover we're seeing from GM and I think that we'll see from other auto manufacturers in the coming years.\n\nThat said, the story about the industry is also a story about Chinese demand. It really is a question about how quickly with Chinese manufactures get good about making quality cars, and will Chinese nationalism propel these cars over their American competitors. Thus far, Ford and GM have faced slowing sales in China. I think part of that is a reaction to the current politics, part of it that Chinese cars are good enough now.

Add to this substantial sums of money, ESPECIALLY if you are a youngin' (i.e 20's or teens). Don't mess around with compounding. \n\n2) Read. READ. READ. John Bogle, esp. All about Asset Allocation.

Learning some parts about technical analysis, fundamental analysis, etc. \n\n3) Subscribe to [Investors.com](https://Investors.com), investors business daily, & [www.aaii.com](https://www.aaii.com).\n\n4) Remember, there are people and computers LITERALLY doing this 24/7. You have a SMALL% chance of growing your portfolio on your own\n\nMy opinion is, and some will disagree, speculate on when you can afford to and that amount is different for everyone, but start at 5% or so your portfolio or monthly/annual funding needs. I WISH I had just started max funding or nearly max funding my IRA/401k at 22. People do not realize that MOST long-term wealthy accumulation comes from a FEW factors:\n\n1) Low-trading costs, low fees, low-tax impact\n\n2) Re-invested dividends; this will amount to 40-60% of your LONG-TERM wealth accumulation. You don't need specifically DIVIDENDS payers, simply etfs/mutual funds over time that distribute dividends & s/l term capital gains is sufficient. Apple started out NOT paying a dividend and now they do. GE started out LONG AGO paying a dividend and now they don't. IMO, and research shows, today, focusing solely on dividends is a losing strategy (Credit: Meb Faber). Better strategy is buying SYLD or similar funds. \n\n3) REGULAR reinvesting. Read: The Next Millionaire Next Door. For present and future millionaires, (they polled over 10,000 millionaires in the latest book), it was never about one stock (that helped), it was never about timing markets. It's about budget, HIGH savings rates, long-term investing, frugality (living within one's means, no matter the income; and most never earned high incomes). Saving, saving, saving & not messing up ASSET ALLOCATION & COMPOUNDING. \n\nI have a 401k, general investment account, and my speculative investment account. I base my spec account on [Investors.com](https://Investors.com) teachings & the book \"100 baggers and how to find them.\" In the book(s), IBD has you as more active, though long-term that can work against you if your personality isn't to 'manage' to that degree. 100-baggers has you more along the lines of a 'coffee can approach,' where you find about 10-20 stocks, dump about 10k into each, then let them ride for ten years. They do discuss the concept of moats and growth and some metrics, but in reality, no one here would have had held AMAZON through it's major 90+% drawdown in the late 90's/2000's \\*if\\* you didn't lock-in for a decade, that's how the BIG money is made. The book, plus IBD's material, helped me crystallize that if I'm not searching for 10-100 baggers, why bother in individual stocks at all?\n\nSure, Apple is great, but it's likely to net you 100% in 10 years, that'd make it a $1.6 trillion dollar company. However, small-cap stocks found through [aaii.com](https://aaii.com), [ibd.com](https://ibd.com) and other sources COULD grow 10-100x in 10 years or less. Those large caps were at least a small or mid-cap company at some point. When FB went public it was a mid-cap company, now it's a large-cap company. Holding a stock like AAPL for the long-term is more of a SWING trade. It may be a great compounder to pivot capital into another position at some point, but it doesn't have the 'risk' to grow 10x or 100x. Is it undervalued? Yeah, I'd say so. It's a 'value' stock' beaten down from 210+ to 134. The dividends, stability and grow make it a good vehicle to slowly grow wealth and preserve it to a point...\n\nMy favorite etfs: VWO, VSS, VEA, GVAL, SYLD, RSP, VNQ, VB. I drip into those at 2k/month, outside my 401k (I max that out with an aggressive portfolio in DFA funds). I buy spec securities about 5% of my income/portfolio now and then, and plan to hold them for 5-10 years. I do think without a plan, you'll get lost.
