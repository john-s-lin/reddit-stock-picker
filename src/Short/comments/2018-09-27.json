I say keep investing but be aware that all you are doing now is trying to time the market cause sooner or later this will fall so don't put in more than you can lose.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 245, "submission_ratio": 0.00816326530612245, "submission_title": "How did $AMZN double marketcap to reach $1trn in 2 years?", "submission_text": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/amazon-stock-price-1-trillion-value.html\n\nDid not know how quickly it grew\n\n- Amazon 1.5 years to double marketcap to 1trn\n- Apple 5 years  to double marketcap to 1trn\nAny main drivers/announcements or was it simply parabolic all of 2017/2018\n\nNot been a big follower of the stock.", "parent_text": "How did $AMZN double marketcap to reach $1trn in 2 years? https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/amazon-stock-price-1-trillion-value.html\n\nDid not know how quickly it grew\n\n- Amazon 1.5 years to double marketcap to 1trn\n- Apple 5 years  to double marketcap to 1trn\nAny main drivers/announcements or was it simply parabolic all of 2017/2018\n\nNot been a big follower of the stock.", "parent_score": 245, "parent_ratio": 0.00816326530612245}, {"time": 1538064594.0, "submission_id": "9jdaqz", "comment_id": "e6qnlix", "body": "FOMO", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 245, "submission_ratio": 0.00816326530612245, "submission_title": "How did $AMZN double marketcap to reach $1trn in 2 years?", "submission_text": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/amazon-stock-price-1-trillion-value.html\n\nDid not know how quickly it grew\n\n- Amazon 1.5 years to double marketcap to 1trn\n- Apple 5 years  to double marketcap to 1trn\nAny main drivers/announcements or was it simply parabolic all of 2017/2018\n\nNot been a big follower of the stock.", "parent_text": "How did $AMZN double marketcap to reach $1trn in 2 years? https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/technology/amazon-stock-price-1-trillion-value.html\n\nDid not know how quickly it grew\n\n- Amazon 1.5 years to double marketcap to 1trn\n- Apple 5 years  to double marketcap to 1trn\nAny main drivers/announcements or was it simply parabolic all of 2017/2018\n\nNot been a big follower of the stock.", "parent_score": 245, "parent_ratio": 0.00816326530612245}, {"time": 1538072920.0, "submission_id": "9jdaqz", "comment_id": "e6qy4o6", "body": "The company did nothing, everybody just thinks E-Commerce will be ubiquitous and amazon just happens to be the leader in NA rn.

This effectively took the monopoly that was the Bell System and split it into entirely separate companies that would continue to provide telephone service. AT&T would continue to be a provider of long distance service, while the now-independent Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) would provide local service, and would no longer be directly supplied with equipment from AT&T subsidiary Western Electric.\n\nThis divestiture was initiated by the filing in 1974 by the United States Department of Justice of an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T.

Like or hate him this is my thought process if you are interested. \n\nThe market will rise or fall mainly based on what happens over the next 2 months. Has little to do with valuation anymore. People spend based on comfort levels with who is in charge. More people working right now means more people dumping money into 401k. Stock market will rise until that changes. Big money players will try and cause fear so they can get out and re position. This works because they have the money to move the needle. But I don't see them doing this yet. They normally start these talks a few months in advance anyway. They have to create enough fear to get people to bail all at once when they pull their money. I believe that the supreme court pick will be indication of how things play out. If Kavanaugh gets through, I believe the market will react positively and vise versa. Same will go with midterms. If there is a blue wave, the market will react poorly, if there is a red wave if will continue upwards. Big money will be watching these things so they can play on the fears of the people. If they find the right spot to add to panic they will take it and there will be a correction. But only for long enough that they by back in at a good price. \n\nWhether you vote one way or the other doesn't really matter. It's about government being on the same side. If its blue house then there will be more and worse fighting which leads to more instability and a decrease in consumer confidence.

I just look at my losses like \"tuition\" since I'm a new investor lol. My entry point leaves a bit of meat on the bones but given what I know about the company, I think it has great prospects. \n\nMany people believe that the only catalyst for VSTM was the FDA approval of duvelisib but I would not be surprised if there is more on the horizon for duvelisib and possibly its FAK inhibitor, defactinib. \n\nAlthough I love technical analysis, for me this company is about its product than anything. Duvelisib is an oral monotherapy, which is as good as it gets when it comes to patient compliance. It's currently approved for relapse-refractory, therapy-resistant CLL/SLL, which means that these patients have very limited options, essentially negating the black box label. From interviews I've seen, physicians who conducted the trials have spoken rather glowingly about the drug and it's performed well in trials compared to alternatives therapies for its approved indications. The company seemed to anticipate the black box and have guidance for physicians regarding this label. \n\nAlso, for these kinds of patients, an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) is what you want to see and the [DUO trial](http://www.verastem.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Flinn-et-al-ASH-2017.pdf) met this endpoint. I can see this drug getting approved for other indications in the near future as hematologists begin to prescribe this drug. The fact that it's an oral monotherapy is huge. Many patients live very far from their hematologists so if they have the option to not drive super far for infusions AND they get an increase in PFS, I'd have a hard time believing this drug won't sell.\n\nDefactinib is another potential catalyst that's only in phase I/II rn too. It seems like it has the potential to be a critical part of combination therapies for common solid tumors as well. If the trials show promising results, we're gonna have another run-up. \n\nEven though the dip is a lot to stomach, this is what you want to see, especially if you have a lot of cash on hand. Just keep buying the dips to lower your average cost and you'll be looking back on this in several years as one your winners. Financially, VSTM has enough cash to run their operations for several more years and they now have a drug ready for sale as of right now for relapse-refractory CLL/SLL/FL. They have more indications that can still be approved, possibly as part of combo therapy, and another drug in the pipeline. Lots of room for growth and the current valuation is fair tbh. \n\nOverall, I don't regret investing in this company, I just wish I was more patient with my entry point. A great mistake to make in my 20s I guess.

I have been trading stocks for several years now but I have avoided options. \n\nI would like to know what some of you think about placing a put option for a struck price of around $265 (Tesla is currently trading for about $270 after hours) tomorrow for Tesla as with everything going on I expect their share price to drop. I would want to place an order for a 1 day contract and sell before the contract expires.  I fully expect the put ask prices to skyrocket by tomorrow morning due to the response of the market to Elon Musk being sued after hours.\n\nI am wondering if it\u2019s a complete dumb idea to purchase the put contract as since there was already a drop of 13% after hours, is there much room for it to drop further? Would this even be profitable even and worth the risk? I know it is impossible to predict these things for certain I\u2019m just looking for input.\n\nThank you everyone for the help, and as I said i am a beginner when it comes to options (and reddit in general) so any advice is greatly appreciated. ", "parent_text": "I\u2019m probably just going to avoid options until I\u2019m much more confident with my knowledge in them. If Tesla shares dip below $250 tomorrow I\u2019ll probably just purchase a handful of regular shares instead as I still see this as a good opportunity since I still believe Tesla will succeed in the long run.
