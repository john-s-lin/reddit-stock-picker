Google would have the advantage of being first, but I don't foresee their pricing being competitive with games you can purchase through other services. Also there would be a complete lack of mod support, which I know most won't care about but I do. I would never buy or rent a Bethesda game through Google, straight up fact. The closest thing I've seen to what I would like is nvidia's service that pretty much runs a VM that uses your steam login to play games. They could easily add workshop support and that would be worth the money if I couldn't afford a gaming PC up front. I think Google would rather go for the simplicity of \"it just works in your browser\" and that will appeal to a new audience, but not the existing one. So with all this, I don't think it will surpass the traditional PC gaming market. \n\nI also dont understand how you think they could monetize this well? Sure they could sell the games themselves and take a standard 30% cut, but how is that any better than valve or DRM free services that promise a little more ownership, better prices, mod support, and so on? I personally think this will be a niche product that will disappear within 6 years, like many of Google's exploratory projects and Onlive and those that came before.

If they sell for cheap, it could be a hit.\n\nI don't think publishers will mind. It's basically just playing the PC version of the game on a server elsewhere, so Google will just update with PC patches. Also, publishers have to pay a decent amount of fees to Sony and Microsoft, just to push out a patch, and they many times have to wait for it to pass certification before users can download it. If Google undercuts this like they do with the Google Play Store, publishers can update their games for free and fix issues on a faster basis. Honestly, comparing all of the stores to buy games/apps, Google has proven itself to be much more stable than the garbage stores on PlayStation/Xbox.\n\nI have a feeling that Google will make this much like a subscription model where you get access to many games for free, but can pay a bit to get access to new games. Hell, if they do make their console into a competitive console, hardware-wise, maybe you will do a bit of streaming as well as local play, much like PlayStation and PSNow.

It's basically just playing the PC version of the game on a server elsewhere, so Google will just update with PC patches. Also, publishers have to pay a decent amount of fees to Sony and Microsoft, just to push out a patch, and they many times have to wait for it to pass certification before users can download it. If Google undercuts this like they do with the Google Play Store, publishers can update their games for free and fix issues on a faster basis. Honestly, comparing all of the stores to buy games/apps, Google has proven itself to be much more stable than the garbage stores on PlayStation/Xbox.\n\nI have a feeling that Google will make this much like a subscription model where you get access to many games for free, but can pay a bit to get access to new games. Hell, if they do make their console into a competitive console, hardware-wise, maybe you will do a bit of streaming as well as local play, much like PlayStation and PSNow. I guess we will see, but I definitely wouldn't count out Google.\n\nAlso, this is coming from another Project Stream beta user that also used PSNow before. I was skeptical about game streaming after using PSNow, as it didn't work perfectly, even on a 75/75 internet plan.

At the root, AI aka neural networks is still flipping bits to get to an outcome.  A chip processor is just a collection of relays (transistors), so there is still some inherit logic that it uses.  AI learns via machine learning or training it with millions of samples.  From this, it builds a decision tree.  This is fine for a very specific task, but it can't bleed over to another task.  But humans have the ability to learn and then apply some aspects of it to a new task.  For example, if we got into a new car, we would eventually figure out what all the controls do without having to be taught each knob.  However, for an AI, it has to be retrained with another million samples.  Want an AI to still work if the steering wheel was on the right side?  Train it again with a million samples.\n\nSo how is that humans can apply what we learn easily, but AI needs to be retrained with million of samples again?  It's because we have consciousness.  Not trying to get too deep here, but consciousness is God.  And we are no where close to discovering how God works.  This is like trying to invent a light bulb without first discovering electricity.

Local hosting will always have some place with people who value DRM-Free gaming (such that they will maintain ownership no matter what), but streaming will be the dominant form of PC gaming within the decade.\n\nI'm not suggesting you invest now.

I have a masters degree in energy investing from Houston and the ordeal with oil is that it\u2019s basically impossible to understand, make sense of, or trade. It doesn\u2019t follow supply and demand so it\u2019s preeeeety weird. \n\nIf you want a market health check, add XOM, Chevron, (big oil), Concho, Parsley, (small oil), Anadarko, ConocoPhillips (medium oil), SWN and Chesapeake (natty gas) to your watch list. \n\nThese stocks will let you know quite a bit by just following price movement and headlines. It\u2019s sort of an SP500 of oil stocks, IMO.\n\nAdditionally, the past is not indicative of the future for oil, but it will be around far longer than you, me, or our financial interest. You can also go long big oil. If someone finds a technology to turn cat piss into energy, XOM will just buy it. They are energy companies with the most oil, not oil companies. Similar to MO and weed, they are set up to make and distribute energy just like MO is set up to grow and roll weed.\n\nLastly, I follow XOM the closest and it seems really beat up considering what they have been doing. It\u2019s basically the biggest and healthiest company I follow among any industry and its stock price is in shambles. Oddly enough, doesn\u2019t matter at all for XOM. Their balance sheet is just flawless right now and they continue to dominate. This may be a good stock to buy a few shares of to get a feel for the market and the headlines. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t spend much time applying fundamentals in oil. Historically, the people with the best information, education, capital, and tools (Wallstreet) have lost billions trying to time oil. It\u2019s a boom or bust industry and you can make some fun money if you catch a boom, but no spreadsheet or algo is going gonna tell you when. \n\n2019 is gonna be a weird one. I\u2019d recommend staying on the sidelines but I am in no way on oil stock sidelines, so take that for what it is. I work proudly for the 5th largest renewable energy company, so do know this post is as factual as I can make it, not many opinions in here except the SP500 comment.

You can look at 2015 for example of how their production levels had affected both canadian and US based shale oil extraction. They flooded the market causing a massive drop in oil pricing, which in turn lead to shale oil extraction no longer being profitable. I was living in Alberta at the time, and the domino effect was brutal. Construction, retail, housing, mortgages, car sales, everything was affected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few other important things to look at for correlation:\n\n1. Figure out which countries produce oil and look into news stories from these regions. \n2. Emerging markets and popularity of alternative / renewable fuel and energy. \n3. Introduction and/or elimination of carbon emission related laws and regulations.\n4. Automation within the industry, employment and layoffs.\n5.

Our financials here are pretty bad. Turbines are underperforming and the wind resource just isn\u2019t what we forecasted. Solar projects are tough from a real estate perspective to get going and the battery storage thing is going very slow. I\u2019d probably stay away from stocks that are 100% renewables. \n\nSome big oil companies just went ham sandwich in offshore wind. Shell and Equinor could be interesting if those work out in the long run. Offshore wind is the hot thing right now, but not sure how it will work out in the USA. Super expensive, but big payout. I\u2019m actually going to get on that project next year, so follow up - offshore wind is the future of renewables if there is a future in renewables.  \n\nAlso, natural gas is basically unstoppable at this price. It\u2019s infinite, cheap, easy to move, and storable. If you can somehow play natural gas, that may be a good play in the long run. SWN is super heavy natural gas, but so are all the big oil companies. WM is even using their landfills to generate natural gasses, so it literally is just infinite at this point. \n\nMy point here is that renewables for electricity may be in trouble. I just don\u2019t see it competing for electricity in the long run against natural gas. It\u2019s interesting, electric cars use electricity. 34% of electricity comes from natural gas and 33% is coal. Every year, coal goes down and natural gas goes up in this ratio. If you drive an electric car, chances are you are using hydrocarbons, not wind or solar. I feel the media has sort of portrayed electric cars as the end of oil, but now it\u2019s just the birth of natural gas. And I hope it does, because natural gas is a really great energy, really clean, and USA has enough to last longer than humans will. Oil obviously has become more trouble than anyone could have ever expected.\n\nI\u2019m in XOM and SWN. I will sell XOM at $100 and SWN around $18-$21. Could be this year, could be in 5, could be never.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve moved all my other energy stocks into REITs. I\u2019m going long property and monthly dividends.

Only one or two small things I would disagree with here.\n\n1. Oil does follow supply and demand, it just doesn't 100% follow supply and demand. 2014 crash was pretty much all supply/demand related, for example. It's just that with oil a lot of other shit gets priced in because traders of oil make assumptions about how various things will affect oil. So you have shit like wars overseas causing price movements or threats of things causing price movements. So... More like supply and demand is the base, but other things sway the price in addition to basic supply/demand.\n\n2. XOM is in an interesting position. They're pretty oil-heavy, they are refining-heavy compared to other majors, and they made some bets during sexy rexys time there that didn't pan out so well - like the whole Russia thing, for example, and XTO not turning out to be the best purchase. I think they're taking a bit of a hit due to all those things. But this is just more opinion than any actual disagreement with your post.\n\nTo anyone else reading, to expand on his point about big oil companies just buying companies if they become attractive enough: the capex budgets for these companies are like $30+ billion a year. First solar, one of the biggest renewable companies, has a market cap under $5 billion. Vestas wind systems has a market cap of under $15 billion.

Oil as an economic resource is extremely valuable, but just like any property or company, at what price shall we consider it a good investment.  Exxon\u2019s stock was $78/share 10 years ago, and today, it\u2019s stock has dropped to $68/share. You can check out the price history of other big oil companies and the results are no better. \n\nThere are some flaws to worry about when the investment thesis is to buy due to an attractive dividend. Does buying stock on this method beat a broad U.S. index fund? You must also deduct taxes on your dividends before comparing performance. Another big issue to worry about is how dependable you think the dividends will be in the future.

But recently, Ive been watching the movement in some oil stocks (MRO, WTI, DIG/DUG, OILU). The low prices are starting to become enticing. But before I start investing in this market, I have few questions about these stocks and the driving forces behind their prices. All help is appreciated.\n\n1. How do rising oil prices affect these underlying stocks? (I know it probably isnt 1-to-1 correlation) but generally do oil prices changes indicate any directional change in stock prices?\n\n2. Can anyone ELI5 why oil has fallen so low so fast recently?\n\n3. Recent news of oil production shortages. How is this expected to affect the oil market? I assume this is one reason for low stock prices currently.\n\n4. What other news developments in the oil market world typically affect stock prices? (middle east news? global warming news? EPA and its regulation?) Any/all correlations you all have noticed, I'd love to hear.\n\nThank you in advance.

Just like how Google can't cross the issue with Amazon.  I think you are confused on the type of scale.\n\nScale is the back end scale.   Maybe another example.   Google created Backrub/PageRank.   But that was only part of the equation.   The \"magic\" of Google was scaling search.  So all the infrastructure to support.   People think it was simply Backrub/PageRank but in many ways that was the easy part.\n\nSo if you apply this to SDC.  You have to solved the driving aspect.  But that is only part of the equation.  Equally big is then scaling the robot taxi operation.\n\nApple and others can solved the SDC aspect but the barrier to compete is scaling of the taxi service.  That is why once someone is at scale it shut out Apple and others.\n\nFullfillment is why Amazon has NO competitors.  Not the front end.   Apple it is worse as they also outsource their cloud to Google.  So  for them it is NOT just the lack of scale for the taxi service but even the digital infrastructure.\n\n\"Apple confirms it uses Google\u2019s cloud for iCloud\"\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/apple-confirms-it-uses-google-cloud-for-icloud.html\n\nApple also does NOT have the TPUs which are vitale for the training.

Apple outsourcing their cloud does not even invest into such things.\n\n\"Google I/O 2018: AI Everywhere; TPU 3.0 Delivers 100+ Petaflops but Requires Liquid Cooling\"\n\nhttps://www.hpcwire.com/2018/05/09/google-o-2018-ai-everywhere-tpu-3-0-delivers-100-petaflops-requires-liquid-cooling/\n\nBut not just the chips but Apple has completely missed AI.\n\n> There is no advantage to scaling up if you cannot make use of the larger scale. You don't actually save money unless you are doing more business. If you do not do more business when you scale up you are simply spending more money on operations to do the same thing.\n\nI completely agree with this. You are making my point.  What Amazon did was fund the scaling as they built the business.  That is the problem for Apple.  Once there is someone else already at scale the financials do not work to scale it.   You are making my point for me.  Thank you!\n\nI am not sure how old or worked in business?    \n\nBut SDC is NOT about being first.  This is something people often times get wrong.  They see Amazon first and won and connect the two.   it is about getting to scale.  Who gets to scale first wins.  The reason is that it is impossible to compete with scale.   Waymo has already launched and has up to 82k cars coming in a relatively short time frame.    \n\nIt is why Google has the problem of not being able to compete with Amazon.   They have the digital scale but NOT the fullfillment scale.   \n\nGoogle has the over $100B.  It is NOT money why they can't.   The problem is someone with scale has a pricing advantage that is impossible to compete with.    \n\nBut with SDC there is an aspect that makes scale even more valuable than normal.   That is when you have scale you can offer a far better UX.\n\nBTW, I wish Apple had NOT got so far behind.   SDC is going to cost a fortune and there is really only a couple of companies with the financial means to pull it off.  Apple and Alphabet have the money to do it.    Alphabet over $100B with $6B debt and NO dividend and do NOT need material buybacks.   Apple more money but over $100B debt.   Both adding fast.  So Apple has the money but unfortunately got too far behind.\n\nWaymo will be at scale before Apple even launched.  Which means I bet Apple will never launch as they are smart business people and know without scale they can't compete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 7, "submission_ratio": 0.14285714285714285, "submission_title": "Will Google pass Apple in market value today?", "submission_text": "Will be curious to see if Google passes Apple today in market cap.

They have the service launched.\n\nAnd my entire point is that first to market is not important when you can easily cross the barriers to entry, which Apple can do once they have their service.\n\n> SDC is something that a waterfall approach is NOT going to work. You scale up while running the service. Google/Waymo will have scale while Apple does not. That is the issue.\n\nAnd once Apple has a service they will be able to scale quickly, so it is not an issue. As I stated many times already.\n\n>That is true but that is distribution. That is NOT why Amazon is difficult to compete with. Google has more users they are interacting with. So they have distribution. But the problem is Google does NOT have the scale for fulfillment. This is why Waymo is a lot like Amazon.\n\n> Scale is NOT a distribution thing but it is about your operation and cost.\n\nThere is no advantage to scaling up if you cannot make use of the larger scale. You don't actually save money unless you are doing more business. If you do not do more business when you scale up you are simply spending more money on operations to do the same thing.\n\n> SDC is even more a scale issue. Reason being the primary UX factor is time in getting a car. When you have scale you can get the car to the person a lot faster. Why also once you have scale you won. Who has scale can make it so nobody else gains enough traction.\n\nAnd as I stated many times before when Apple decides to launch a service they will be able to scale quickly. So, not an issue.\n\n> That is true. Because they have no fullfillment. If they did they could use their own service. They have the money to build it out but that would be crazy. Reason being Amazon already has scale. This is the exact situation Apple will have with SDC. They fell too far behind.\n\nThis is not the same, because all Apple would need to do is to pay to produce the cars and set up the minimal infrastructure and employees required where they are running the service. A local service is much different from trying to build a global supply chain. \n\n> The issue is NOT acquiring customers for Google obviously. Tons search on a product and have the potential customers. They can't fullfill. That is why scale matter. But NOT front end but rather fullfillment. SDC fullfillment is getting a car to a person. Is is very similar to Amazon.\n\nWhich Apple would easily be able to scale up to when they decide to launch a service, because they have enough money to get the cars made and install infrastructure quickly. \n\nAdditionally, google's e-commerce model has always been based off of taking a fee for connecting sales \n\n>Apple does NOT track the Uber and Lyft cars. They both use Google maps and NOT Apple maps.\n\nI'm not saying they track the cars, I'm saying they have limited ability to track when/where users are using the apps.\n\n> But it is so much more. Google has Gmail to leverage which obviously Apple does NOT have.\n\n> So you send an email or make a calendar event and Google can offer a car. Google knows what people are doing. What events are happening. They just have a lot more data to leverage then Apple.\n\nApple could do the same features available native to iPhone with Siri integration.\n\n> But this is NOT the primary barrier. The barrier is scale. SDC is all about scale. Just like Ecommerce.\n\nWHICH APPLE WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO QUICKLY SCALE UP ANY SERVICE THEY WANT TO PROVIDE.\n\n>Not sure what \"control\" Google would be missing with SDC with Android? Google controls Android and what is on the phone, etc.\n\nNo it doesn't. The phone manufacturers do. Samsung, Huawei, LG, Motorola. Android is just an open source OS that these companies use. They will get to modify OS and determine what apps get preloaded on the phones. Google only has this control for the Pixel because it is the only phone they actually make. \n\nApple makes iPhone and has full control over iOS and any preloaded apps, for 40% of phones in the US.\n\n>But really it is NOT about the phone. But more what people do with the phone. Google has 5 of the top 7 apps used on ALL smartphones.\n\n> Apple has one which is Apple Music.\n\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps\n> Apple Music is not something leveragable for SDC. But Gmail is. Search is. Google Maps is.\n\nApple can preload their service on 40% of smartphones in the US. That is leverageable. \n\n>Well then you might be blind? Not trying to be offensive.\n\n> You search on the time of a movie. Here is your car. You search on whatever in the physical world. Here is your car. Or just typing car into Google search. Google has 94% of the market. Apple does NOT have even 50% of anything. There are tons and tons that never use anything Apple. 94%+ are using Google.\n\nWell, in that case anytime someone uses Siri Apple could do the same. \n\n>That is true. How is that a plus with SDC? Maybe I am not seeing it? iOS is used by a minority and have ZERO clue how it even plays? I guess having their driving app ship with iPhones is all I got?\n\nAs I said before, they can leverage this by immediately having their service available on iPhones. 40% of the smartphone market, plus integration with other apps native to those phones. Google has less than 3% of the US market for smartphones. Likely to accomplish the same thing they would need to pay companies like Samsung, Verizon, etc to make the service natively available on phones. If you think having a service natively available on 40% of phones is not just as good, if not better, than having it integrate with popular apps you are sorely mistaken.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1546094540.0, "submission_id": "aaauq0", "comment_id": "ecsyelw", "body": "You are obsessed with the idea that Apple would not be able to scale the operations of Google is already in place.

Just like how Google can't cross the issue with Amazon.  I think you are confused on the type of scale.\n\nScale is the back end scale.   Maybe another example.   Google created Backrub/PageRank.   But that was only part of the equation.   The \"magic\" of Google was scaling search.  So all the infrastructure to support.   People think it was simply Backrub/PageRank but in many ways that was the easy part.\n\nSo if you apply this to SDC.  You have to solved the driving aspect.  But that is only part of the equation.  Equally big is then scaling the robot taxi operation.\n\nApple and others can solved the SDC aspect but the barrier to compete is scaling of the taxi service.  That is why once someone is at scale it shut out Apple and others.\n\nFullfillment is why Amazon has NO competitors.  Not the front end.   Apple it is worse as they also outsource their cloud to Google.  So  for them it is NOT just the lack of scale for the taxi service but even the digital infrastructure.\n\n\"Apple confirms it uses Google\u2019s cloud for iCloud\"\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/apple-confirms-it-uses-google-cloud-for-icloud.html\n\nApple also does NOT have the TPUs which are vitale for the training.   Google gets to leverage their 100 peta flop processors to lower cost in training and do the training much more quickly.   Apple outsourcing their cloud does not even invest into such things.\n\n\"Google I/O 2018: AI Everywhere; TPU 3.0 Delivers 100+ Petaflops but Requires Liquid Cooling\"\n\nhttps://www.hpcwire.com/2018/05/09/google-o-2018-ai-everywhere-tpu-3-0-delivers-100-petaflops-requires-liquid-cooling/\n\nBut not just the chips but Apple has completely missed AI.\n\n> There is no advantage to scaling up if you cannot make use of the larger scale. You don't actually save money unless you are doing more business. If you do not do more business when you scale up you are simply spending more money on operations to do the same thing.\n\nI completely agree with this. You are making my point.  What Amazon did was fund the scaling as they built the business.  That is the problem for Apple.  Once there is someone else already at scale the financials do not work to scale it.   You are making my point for me.  Thank you!\n\nI am not sure how old or worked in business?    \n\nBut SDC is NOT about being first.  This is something people often times get wrong.
