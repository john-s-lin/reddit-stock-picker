Then buy into solid high dividend earners while giving yourself twenty percent or so to get in on a company or two you've been eyeing. You will gain a solid return on solid stocks.

So instead of buying shares in each of those companies, I can buy the ETF and automatically get exposure to all the 50 stocks. \n\nAs such, there are all kinds of ETFs including ones that are industry specific (like GDX), region-specific (like [Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&FundId=0963&funds_disable_redirect=true)), size-specific (like [iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239763/ishares-core-sp-midcap-etf)), and so on. ETFs come in a thousand shapes; there are thousands of them out there. There is even one for MAGA, and it tracks companies that are expected to benefit from Trump's presidency (the criteria for selection is the political campaign contributions that the company has made to the Republican party).
