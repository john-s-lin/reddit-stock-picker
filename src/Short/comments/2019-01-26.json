Especially on Insta / etc.\n \nFull disclosure: I am long on FB, and it is the largest position I own. However, I also believe in investing in what you use (i.e. Buffett strategy). \n\nWhile I don't really use FB much for personal interaction (I use it more as a version of the old Yahoo homepage for news -- a major shift in my habits and one that I'd imagine is lucrative for them re: ad dollars), my advertising spend on FB continues to rise. It seems to be increasingly effective, and it is much easier for me to use vs. Google ads (or any other ads, for that matter). My ad spend on FB in 2019 will likely double compared to what it was in 2018. And beyond my change in site usage, I think this change is what underscores my personal positivity re: outlook on FB. \n\nFinal note: I noticed that ad impressions per $ dropped tremendously in December (for $100 I get about 15,000 reach today -- in December, this was down to 8,000 before Christmas). I believe they have a dynamic demand-based pricing model, and this would indicate that advertiser spend was exceedingly high for the holiday season. Beyond increasing my spend in 2019, this is the single-largest reason I believe their earnings will outperform consensus come report time. \n\nI am currently anticipating a steady rise in stock price through the end of August, after which point I am probably going to sell, as I think regardless of FB's outlook (which will still be fantastic), the market in general is going to repeat 2008 this September, perhaps not quite as badly, but enough to hammer companies that are doing well. At the bottom I will re-invest in FB again. Prior to the next bottom, I think FB does $210-230 by the end of this summer before retreating back to ~$120 by 12/2019.

You need to realize that your morals are based on Marxist garbage that is utterly false.\n2. Since those morals are based on a flawed ideology, you need to re-evaluate your morals and the basis for them.\n3. Find or create a moral system that reflects reality.\n4. See what you think of stocks then.\n5. You may be better served to study Economics or Philosophy, prior to Business, to aid aid in the above process.\n\nPoints to consider:\n1. Capitalism does not steal a worker's labor in any way. Taxes are theft. Robin-Hood-like policies that are designed to take from the rich and give to the poor are theft. You act as though the tools the company provides and maintains, the marketing it does, and so on should all belong to the worker. All workers are allowed to negotiate for wages and keep those wages to do with as they please. They are free to save up, develop an idea or product, and start a business of their own. This only possible in Capitalism.\n2. Socialism is entirely about taking everything from you and making serfs and peasants of us all. If you have no property, you own nothing and all your labor is stolen. Just because we are equally unable to keep the fruits of our labor, that doesn't mean that you get to keep any of it. All the poorly thought out Marxist ideas are just means of keeping people from having what they earned, and letting a government control what they get to have, rather than each individual negotiating for and keeping the fruits of their labor.\n3. How does one start a business in Capitalism and how would one do so in a Socialist economy? In one case, you can save up and start it yourself or borrow money. In the other, it requires the allocation of resources you don't own. So, who determines what products are made? What advancements should be developed? A committee? (Of the highest intellect and character, I'm sure...) A dictator? How?

I base my morals upon my life experience, as does everyone. In my personal opinion it is morally good to look out for others and provide for those who are no longer able to provide for themselves. Yes this moral philosophy makes me more susceptible to marxist ideas, especially when you add to that the echo chamber effect  of liberal universities. However I try my best to evaluate policies and ideals through my own moral lenses.\n\nI will cede the fact the pure socialism isn\u2019t a viable economic policy, but neither is pure capitalism. We need institutional policies in place to put restraints upon the most risk tolerant businessmen, otherwise markets are prone to bubbles and collapses. Likewise we need certain socialistic institutions in our day to day life. We need fire departments because capitalism and the free market does not provide a \u201csolution\u201d unless you consider allowing poor people houses to burn down because they can\u2019t afford otherwise a solution. (I am simply looking to argue that socialism is necessary within our modern capitalistic environment in some capacity).  \n\nIt is my personal belief that the only way to combat societal inequality is to provide institutional assistance to the disadvantaged groups. \n\nGranted we don\u2019t have great policies in place currently to serve that mission. But just because they aren\u2019t working appropriately now (and it is impossible to achieve 100% efficiency) is not a good reason to refuse to work on reforming our welfare and socialistic policies (not to say there aren\u2019t good reasons for cutting funding for such programs, the proper implementation of austerity for example) \n\nIn my personal view the only way to achieve true equality of opportunity is to provide a level playing field to all participants which is why I find myself in favor of the concepts behind  free rudimentary health care and a small universal basic income. Granted there aren\u2019t any proposals that would work in the US currently, but I still support the general concepts. \n\nI understand to all those reading this I come off as very naive. I am simply stating my moral outlook, I understand that the application of many of these concepts are inefficient and borderline impossible to implement. As a result I don\u2019t find myself supporting many actual policy change proposals. \n\nHowever in my view taxes are not theft but rather mandatory support of the socialistic polices that we all stand to benefit from. Being an American citizen entitles us to many liberties that we constantly take for granted, but they still need funding regardless. Thus in my view the success any American citizen achieves (in any sense of the word) is in part due to opportunities provided by this amazing nation. And as such I believe we are obligated to repay our dues and buy back into the system for future generations to receive the same benefits we did. You are perfectly entitled to your view that taxes are theft, but it would only be completely true if you never received anything in return from the government. Otherwise it is collection and redistribution attempted in the best interest of societal progress.  \n\nTLDR: my moral outlook leads me to believe we need to look out for all members of our community, socialism (although flawed) is necessary in some form in order for our capitalistic society to succeed, and taxes are the method through which we pay for these programs.

I understand that logically I will *have* to start trading at some point, I don't feel comfortable about making money off of other people's work, did you share this specific opposition, and how has your position grown or developed? If you trade stocks and are salaried do you find yourself viewing the money you worked for differently from what you traded for? Is there a morally correct way to trade stocks?  Or is the stock market not a bad thing at all and I'm just viewing it from the wrong perspective? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am open to all advice and criticism, and ideally just want to create a good conversation out of this. The only thing I would like to avoid is the Lorax argument (If I didn't do it, someone else would) because I don't believe the behavior of others justify one's own misdeeds. Thanks for taking the time to read my post, I apologize if you found what I wrote offensive, that was no means my intention. I would love to hear what you have to say, regardless of where you stand on the subject. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm pretty new to Reddit, I hope this is the right sub to post on, and I tried looking for a similar thread before posting but couldn't find one. If there is one you know of I would love it if you could point me in that direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I am morally opposed to the underlying nature of stock trading, what advice do you have as for how to reconcile my reservations or get over them?", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 0.0}]
