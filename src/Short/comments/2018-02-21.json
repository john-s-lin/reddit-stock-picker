In investing terms, long term is often considered 5, sometimes 10+ years out. I think your problem is thinking long term is much shorter than it really is. A matter of weeks or months is short term. You have to be patient to successfully invest and be willing to stick to things when your holdings are super high and when they are depressingly low.\n\nGE is certainly a tough one. They have their hands in so many things, have major brand name recognition, large resources, and the potential/means to once again be a healthy company. They just need the right leadership, game plan, and identity. This last decade or so has proven to be an absolute nightmare for them. Will they change that and get back on track? That\u2019s anyone guess and one can only speculate.\n\nAs for selling, buying more, or keeping them that\u2019s up to you but you have to ask yourself a few questions first before taking any action. Why did you buy them and what is now making you want to sell them? Did you research the company before buying and what about right now? Do you see any promising or alarming financial figures, trends, news, products, competition, people, or data involving the company influencing your mindset? What is the future for this company and it\u2019s industry/sectors? What are it\u2019s most promising facets and what are it\u2019s biggest threats? Ask yourself these things and develop a game plan for the stock, deciding how long you wish to hold, price targets, and how you\u2019ll maneuver the stock.\n\nIf you ask me what I\u2019d do, I would tell you it depends on how much you have invested and what your timeline and risk tolerance is. If you need this money ASAP, then sell it, take your money, and stay out of the market until you have the patience and willingness to do your own research. If it\u2019s a relatively small amount and not a major percentage of your portfolio, I would hold the stock and keep it with hopes of it improving long term while not buying any more GE stock. GE is still a huge company with a large customer base. They have all the tools, resources, money, departments, brand name, and what not required to get back to being a decent company. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll crash and go out of business anytime soon but I do think they\u2019ll eventually cut and discontinue some of their products/services to focus more on certain sectors. Simply put, they\u2019re too big right now and in too many things that it\u2019s become one big mess. This problem combined with some truly pathetic recent leadership has put the company into the position it is in today.
