Yet all you can do is focus on their 'missteps'", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "AAPL falling to $150 would be GOOD NEWS for Long Term Apple investors.", "submission_text": "AAPL is my largest holding.\n\nAnd I'm pretty jacked about Apple dropping 26% the last few months. \n\nWhy?  Because I'm a long-term investor.  I hold my stocks 5-10 years or even more. I really don't care about short-term price fluctuations. I do care about long term value.  And for long term value it is better for Apple's share price to drop and remain 'undervalued' for months or even years.\n\nWhy?  \n\nBUYBACK.\n\nRight now AAPL is worth about $800 billion.  Apple has over $250 billion in cash right now. They generated $78 billion in free cash flow from operations last year.  The math is pretty simple.  In 4-5 years they can easily buyback HALF of the outstanding shares if the stock price remains low.\n\nIn the past because of tax law the cash balance was not very useful. But now Apple is free to spend 100% of their cash on buybacks/dividends.\n\nIt is very possible that in the next 10 years Apple could buyback 75% of the outstanding stock.  That is CRAZY.  \n\nYou can bet your ass that Apple is buying a ton of shares the last couple weeks. \n\nThat is the great thing about owning AAPL right now.  If the stock drops, Apple will dollar cost average for YOU by buying back shares in your behalf.  Basically you are getting the benefit of dollar cost averaging or 'buying the dip' without risking any of your own capital.\n\nTo illustrate the power of buybacks:\n\nIf you owned 20% of Apple before the buyback.....you would own 80% of Apple after Apple buys back 75% of its shares.\n\nOf course for retail investors we own a much smaller stake. But the principle is the same. You will have a much larger stake in the assets of the company. With a 75% buyback your stake in company assets grows 400%.\n", "parent_text": "I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s worth it to keep providing extremely valid reasons to be cautious about Apple from the missteps they\u2019ve made.

Do you know what happens when you produce a commodity at scale?  The price goes down because stores are able to buy in bulk!

Hops are better off because they need to go to manufacturing to produce alcohol that increases the price of their product!  Weed goes straight from farm to store!  Take grapes, vineyards at scale (and if successful) clear close to and less than 15% in Canada.  Many operate at a loss or barely scrape by.  And that\u2019s only because they go on to produce a greater priced product, wine!  Look how grapes fair in the supermarket.  \n\n> Look at the data. Beer and alcohol consumption is on the decline.

You said yourself, one gets you high, the other gets you drunk.  Those are two entirely different effects.  And show me the data where you even get this notion from that A. These drinks are good and B. People will be buying enough.  Big beer is currently in war to be first to market and develop brand recognition before the other guy.  But it will never stop the other guy from making a new beer with a different strain or flavor.  \n\n> Furthermore, CGC has over 125 patent applications and issued patents, and CGC is currently in the middle of a $1B buying spree. STZ controls CGC, and frankly I'd be very surprised if when Sands steps down as CEO in March he doesn't take a more active role in CGC.\n\nPatents will mean nothing.  Oh you have a patent for this strain?  Ok well I grow it in a different soil and trim it differently and user different lights and temperatures.  A court will never give you the win.  Maybe you can patent a seed but as soon as that strain gets bred with anything else to any noticeable unit of measure, it\u2019s a different strain now.  And now you\u2019re opening a whole can of worms on patent law, regulation of strains, increasing cost, increasing black market.    \nAnd of course they\u2019re buying everyone they can!  That\u2019s there only play.  Everyone is trying to grow at scale to outbid each other on contracts or buy out competition.  And they have to give you shareholders false hope of increasing revenue somehow!  But look what happened to big beer.  There\u2019s just another grow op waiting to be opened!  \nAnd this is all without saying everyone will be buying local.  Do you think Quebec is going to be buying from Ontario?  And if you grow to scale to satisfy the masses, at razor thin margins, you never get to produce new strains or experiment.  There will always be massive room for small grow ops to sell locally.  And that\u2019s without mentioning the black market prices.  1oz of weed in CO ~$100, black market ~$80!  \nAnd that reminds me of the biggest untapped market, home growers.  First one to sell kits is going to be rich.  Why pay ~$100/oz when you can grow more than you can ever consume for less!  \n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 46, "submission_ratio": 0.021739130434782608, "submission_title": "CGC down 9%.

Who's buying?", "submission_text": "Do you think marijuana is recession proof?  ", "parent_text": "> Firstly, all these huge Canadian LPs are having trouble growing weed at scale. It's never been done.\n\nOf course it\u2019s never been done it hasn\u2019t been legal.  But all my logic is based on these LPs growing at scale!  So it doesn\u2019t refute anything.  Do you know what happens when you produce a commodity at scale?  The price goes down because stores are able to buy in bulk!  The margins get thinner!  \n\n>Second, comparing weed to hops is not a valid comparison. Weed produces both THC and CBD. One gets you high, the other is an anti-inflammatory with zero side effects.\n\nI\u2019m not comparing weed to hops, I\u2019m trying to show you what will happen in the market.  Hops are better off because they need to go to manufacturing to produce alcohol that increases the price of their product!  Weed goes straight from farm to store!  Take grapes, vineyards at scale (and if successful) clear close to and less than 15% in Canada.  Many operate at a loss or barely scrape by.  And that\u2019s only because they go on to produce a greater priced product, wine!  Look how grapes fair in the supermarket.  \n\n> Look at the data. Beer and alcohol consumption is on the decline. In six months people in Canada will be drinking STZ/CGC THC infused beverages that will have zero calories and that don't leave you with a hangover.\nI know, that\u2019s why beer is desperately trying to retain market share but the fact is they are two different products.  You said yourself, one gets you high, the other gets you drunk.  Those are two entirely different effects.  And show me the data where you even get this notion from that A. These drinks are good and B. People will be buying enough.  Big beer is currently in war to be first to market and develop brand recognition before the other guy.  But it will never stop the other guy from making a new beer with a different strain or flavor.  \n\n> Furthermore, CGC has over 125 patent applications and issued patents, and CGC is currently in the middle of a $1B buying spree. STZ controls CGC, and frankly I'd be very surprised if when Sands steps down as CEO in March he doesn't take a more active role in CGC.\n\nPatents will mean nothing.  Oh you have a patent for this strain?  Ok well I grow it in a different soil and trim it differently and user different lights and temperatures.  A court will never give you the win.  Maybe you can patent a seed but as soon as that strain gets bred with anything else to any noticeable unit of measure, it\u2019s a different strain now.  And now you\u2019re opening a whole can of worms on patent law, regulation of strains, increasing cost, increasing black market.    \nAnd of course they\u2019re buying everyone they can!  That\u2019s there only play.  Everyone is trying to grow at scale to outbid each other on contracts or buy out competition.  And they have to give you shareholders false hope of increasing revenue somehow!  But look what happened to big beer.  There\u2019s just another grow op waiting to be opened!  \nAnd this is all without saying everyone will be buying local.  Do you think Quebec is going to be buying from Ontario?  And if you grow to scale to satisfy the masses, at razor thin margins, you never get to produce new strains or experiment.  There will always be massive room for small grow ops to sell locally.  And that\u2019s without mentioning the black market prices.  1oz of weed in CO ~$100, black market ~$80!  \nAnd that reminds me of the biggest untapped market, home growers.  First one to sell kits is going to be rich.  Why pay ~$100/oz when you can grow more than you can ever consume for less!  \n", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 3.0}, {"time": 1544136690.0, "submission_id": "a3p5j3", "comment_id": "eb8ysv5", "body": "I mean CF is a huge company, I know its not a \"farm\" but it is part of the sector.
