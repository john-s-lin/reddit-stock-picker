I don't think investors will be waiting until the release, or close to it, of Red Dead. There should be a price hike as we approach the release, in the same ways as 'buy the rumor, sell the news'. \n\nTechnicals wise, not worried until the stock close below $100, which has been a strong support for a number of corrections and a psychological level that needs to be maintained. You'll also need to consider new game announcements, such as Borderlands 3. These news will allow the stock to gain more traction and favorable coverage. The current silence makes it an easier prey for shorts and possibly manipulators. It's also worth mentioning that $106-108 is a good support, but I'd say that there's a potential to fall lower and test $100 and finally test 200SMA after a very long time. \n\nI'm still bullish for the next 2-3 years at least, even before a new Grand Theft Auto game. This fall might be discouraging and scary, but remember that even the best undervalued companies with strong balance sheet ($MU is a very good example) witnessed similar out-of-nowhere corrections, and even had very red days while the market is going higher.

Facebook, for me, seems so outdated and boring now that I log in 2-3 times a week and can\u2019t make it past five minutes. I normally only log in just to see if anything crazy happened (local news story, death, marriage, birth, etc.) for people I grew up with or went to school with. Most of the time it\u2019s older folks fighting with one another, stupid fighting over politics, baby pictures, yard sales, or amateur photographers. Maybe I\u2019m just getting older!\n\nI know Instagram is pretty popular and despite not being active on it, it seems more exciting and favorable with the younger crowd today. This company is owned by Facebook which is good. However, I think social media moves so fast and in trends/fads that I think Facebook could lose ground quick if they don\u2019t act fast or make a couple bad moves. I don\u2019t think the Facebook platform is salvageable at this point so they\u2019ll be dependent on buying out companies or trying to implement a new app, software, or feature. What if they miss out on the next big platform or if they buy out a few companies that are quick fads or perform poorly after initial excitement? This would be my fear.\n\nI think we are getting even more interconnected and obtaining our news online even more today but I\u2019m just not sure Facebook is the best place to park my money in to take advantage of this.

I am unfamiliar with oversees competitors so I that is something I need to research more.\n\n\nHistorically, it seems like they make great acquisitions(maybe not Oculus, but time will tell) and they are not eager to burn cash and make dumb acquisitions just for the sake of diversification(compared to twitter and snap).\n\n\nOne thing that has brought me to look at them as an investment is their launch of Facebook Watch, which was launched 6 months ago. I haven't spent too much time on it, but I really like what they have done with \"Tom vs. Time\" which in my mind proves they can make good content with their partners. Only issue with Watch is the partners will take the majority of the ad revenue(also not sure if partners include original content creators like youtube or strictly corporations so I need to do more research on that end).  They tried to make a big push to bring content creators from Youtube, iirc, 2 years ago and I they obviously didn't have much luck, but this could be a big breakthrough.\n\n\nFinancially they are a strong company with growing earnings. They have plenty of cash available so they are capable of making more acquisitions without taking on too much debt or selling equity. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the bad formatting, but any thoughts would be appreciated.", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1521043337.0, "submission_id": "84d4fr", "comment_id": "dvov637", "body": "Tremendous, believe me", "score": 21, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 11, "submission_ratio": 1.9090909090909092, "submission_title": "Thoughts on TWTR?", "submission_text": "Just looking for a little thought on Twitter\u2019s potential and what you all think about it.", "parent_text": "Thoughts on TWTR?

So then after the jump it tanked down under 40. Didn't help that December also ended up being a month long downtrend for all of tech. So now they are all salty about it.\n\nI dont see it slowing down anytime soon. I prefer it over JD at the moment, without question. I never sat through JD's earnings (just played options on the run up) except for the one after their singles day... because JD earnings are still a hit or miss. However comparing it to SQ? I sat through all SQ earnings since june of last year and will continue to do so until they show signs of slowing down. \n\nWould I buy at current price? probably not, I would hold cash and wait for dips since Trump has been triggering buy in opportunities all year.
