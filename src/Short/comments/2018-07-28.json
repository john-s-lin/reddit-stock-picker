Factors like early mover advantage on battery tech, battery infra, super charging infra are already discussed here. One thing I feel worth mentioning is that traditional auto makers suck at software. Tesla is also a software company. They have a huge advantage in the way they blend their cars with their software. Software development typically has a long churn time. This makes it even harder for traditional auto companies. They not only have to transition their core tech but also need to connect their car to internet in a seamless fashion. One option is to outsource this but most of the time that doesn\u2019t provide the same level of control Tesla have over their software today.

Especially with the short thesis of slowing DRAM demand and the near-term return of the boom-bust cycle having a million holes shot in it by SK Hynix's and LRCX's results.\n\nDespite WSB's MUun talk and subsequent depression, I think they're on the money, they're just slitting their wrists constantly because their timeframe is totally unrealistic and expectations too extreme.\n\nAMD maybe. The hype is strong, but their guidance for the rest of the calendar year is extremely unimpressive. If the hype train wins, they could potentially do it but I have less faith there.\n\nThird choice... I really don't know. BA could do it. They've got enough tailwinds, and even missing on deliveries in their ER kept them down for what, 3 hours? They've been trading flat most of the year but fundamentals are great, they're way below almost all PTs, and potential is there for another EOY takeoff rally.
