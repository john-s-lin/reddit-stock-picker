Or if you bail b/c you think we have a top, it could keep going up and you've missed on more gains.  Those are risks with investing.  You could just stick money in bond funds and miss out on gains.   \n\nCan the markets go to shit?  yeah.  I rode the market down in 08-09 and just stayed in figuring it was a long term investment and I didn't want to take the losses while missing out on the gains from the eventual rebound.  I also kept maxing out my contributions and getting a $ for $ match.   Many people bailed at the low and didn't get back in.\n\nI don't have my numbers handy but IIRC, I lost about 25-30% from my peak prior to the financial crisis.  I'm up 300%+ from the bottom.\n\nNow if you have an IRA or taxable account and willing to risk some of that by trading/speculating, go for it.  But keep some in longer term holdings too so you don't blow up your account.\n\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 45, "submission_ratio": 0.022222222222222223, "submission_title": "Please argue", "submission_text": "I'd like to see an argument for and against investing right now.

Also PDT can be removed by most brokers at least once, if you accidentally trigger it. Etrade told me 1x, ever, while I've heard of another (maybe TD) removing it 1x per year.\n\n2: Right. Round trip while PDT margin called would get you COMA'd (Cash Only Margin Access I think it means) meaning you have to wait on things to settle (is it T+2 now?) to use margin. this can slow you down a lot. I think you can day trade as much as you want with a cash account, but no margin means you must wait on settlements or deal with those good faith violations etc.\n\n3: Yes.. PDT hurt me when I was on the borderline. I took a heavy loss (5+%) due to me not wanting to go under and knowing I'd be COMA'd. I hoped it'd turn around and that was a mistake as it always is, though the market sometimes rewards bad behavior which tends to make you repeat it. The only thing I can say about strategy is to use tight risk control. If taking a loss makes you freeze and it gets worse, it'd be better to use a mechanical stop. There should usually be a line in the sand you can draw where you know your thesis was wrong. Most day traders are doing momentum or mean reversion or a little of both.

Purchasing twitch and getting into eSports, getting cheap alexa devices into everyones homes, Amazon Pay for trusted pay on every website and shopify site, amazon prime video, audible, getting into merchanting and deals with chase bank for good CC rewards. This stuff makes sense to me and I can see the value. Amazon wants to make it so that everyone has their membership and pays them $100/yr. This is a solid stream of money for them. Google relies heavily on adsense to make earnings which I think is an inferior business model.  \n\nEither way, you can go into what you know and belive in.
