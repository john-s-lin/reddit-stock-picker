That helps me keeps feeling in check during fluctuations.  \n\n>But the longer this bull market runs the more money I'm going to lose when it stops.  \n\nYou could also look at it like the longer you wait the more gains you miss out on and noone really knows when the next crash occurs. It could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years from now (unlikely). But say the crash doesn't happen in another 5 years, the gains you would have made in this time will more than make up for what you lose, and if you don't sell you technically lose nothing as long as the company doesn't go bankrupt. This is where you pick up more stocks because of discount.  \n\n>I made a lot of bad decisions  \n\nDon't feel bad about this. We all make mistakes, including me. The key is to learn from those mistakes and not make them again.  \n\nFor instance twice in a row I have sold Canopy growth on a run up (sold them at their previous high), both times it decided to go up another 20-30% leaving me with a little regret. But the thing is, there are thousands if not millions of stocks and there will always come another opportunity, so don't ever chase it.   \n\nAlso generally I would advice you to trade as little as you possibly can and never sell unless fundamentals change.  \nTrading as little as possible reduces the mistakes you can make and also helps bring down expenses related to trading (which in the long run can accumulate to an absurd amount of money).  \n\nOne thing I do when I buy a stock is to write down exactly why I am buying it, and then I can retrospectively look at what I wrote and analyze if the situation has changed.  \n\nAnd a final note, if you are investing in the larger companies I would advice you to put your money in an etf instead because it is extremely hard to consistently beat the market when the stocks you buy have little potential for growth.  \nNow if you are like me and realize that you, as a young individual, can tolerate more risk, I would go for the risky plays if you know how to analyze the companies.
