Is it a product you believe in and are those companies making good weed you like?

Will people pay $12-20 a gram? Do your friends and family consume regularly or want to? How many friends do you have that have tried it and don\u2019t like it? I am holding a few stocks but is it really a 14 billion dollar company in the next 3-5 years? Could you use that 30k? Would you be sad if it\u2019s only 10-15k by Christmas as the numbers roll in and the market currently can\u2019t support these speculative prices? Will 4 plants at home change how people grow and sell weed to each other? I think there is truth in these companies making gains in to beverage and pharmaceuticals but have you tried THC drinks? Is it a buzz people want or will drink 5-6 at a time? Lots of questions. I was holding stocks for a while but my stomach can\u2019t handle the market betting. I have small holdings in companies with market caps I can believe in currently. But no one can see 10-15 years in the future. So your guess is as good as ours.

I'll read up more on it. \n\nI'd encourage you to do the same on Canopy which is what I talk about here. \n\nI'll answer based on them since them and only them is what I discussed before. \n\n 1.  We'll see. I don't think it'll completely kill the black market but it will to a big extent in every country that legalizes. And based on how much money there is in the black market I'm convinced there'll be a lot of money to work with for the sector leader.\n\nThey look at every part of the world, they've entered where medical has been legalized. (Bought up companies in Germany, Australia, Colombia, builds a European growing base in Denmark).\n\n\nMedical is the first step. It normalizes the drug, changes public opinion. An opioid crisis on that speeds up the process as it gives politicians a strong moral play, turns legalizing into a question not just for anarchocapitalists, libertarians, potheads.  \n\nPurdues opioids leads to deaths here in Sweden as well. The opioid Crysis is global/a diaspora at least in the west. \n\nSweden will be last on the ball though. We're a weird moralistic alarmistic atheistic leftist bunch with leftists and righ wings agreeing on cannabis.\n\nCanopy has been first on every ball. And every nation that goes for medical  has needed to import weed from where the there's know-how and the product has been approved and there's enough of it.\n\n2. They are indeed overvalued. So is every company. But in which way are they overvalued? Future growth is taken into account. But what happens when that growth has been surpassed? What happens when they're doing medical in Malta, Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Australia, South Africa, Colombia, Chile? When these countries afterwarss fully legalize, their  brand is known, their products are already known and used?\n\nNorway has a  political majority for legalizing.  Berlin wants to legalize in their city already. German public opinion is turning. They just patented the productname \"Chronic by DRE\". They look into how u can reach someone who hasn't tried cannabis. Which kind of product would a woman in her fifties try for the first time? Coffee? Drink? Smoke? Pill? Edible? Lotion? Oil? They bought Hiku Brands for a string of products aiming at the young and hipsters.\n\nBased on Canopys strategy so far it's not likely they won't keep on putting their money into investing rather than banking up. \n\n3. Because of the global growth. The industry won't leave. It'll keep on growing. The big fish will eat the little ones, some companies will survive, some will thrive, some will die. Canopy is the biggest fish and a intelligent one hungry for bigger waters, already set up in the waters that are ready for a MJ market.\n\nSo yeah. That's my take on it. Another crash awaits after legalization as hype dies out again, the institutions are down buying up and playing with the volatile stocks. \n\n But why are u so sure it'll be the end? For everyone of them? For most of them sure. But what about those in good positions for legalization, a global market? Was there no Microsoft or Apple within the dotcom bubble? Did every company just die? \n\n\nAnd a big differnece between the dotcombubble and Cannabis is that the product already is out there in a global billion-market. \n\nIt's not like computers were illegal, everyone had tried one at a party in college, Bill Clintons famous quote would be \" I did not inhale the computer\".\n\nAnd another thought.  U mention that everyone's a \"weedstock-guru\" all of a sudden, telling people what to do with the sector. Well aren't u a similar kind of  guru right now?  Speaking of the sector, what will happen to it.\n\nI'm convinced the market will grow globally and some brands will stick out and be known all over the world. and if I had 10k I wouid have invested them into Canopy when it dips. I'm not even invested in them as they're to expensive for me. \n\nMy biggest warning is to people not following the sector. They shouldn't buy in now. Follow the sector and know what the risks and upsides are, don't buy more than u can't lose etc...\n\nMy second warning is to those who don't follow what happens on a global scale. They should keep an eye on what happens in Germany etc cuz over time they will have their own companies competing with the brands Canopy, Aphria, Aurora has bought.  How is that dealt with? I believe they will keep on buying their non-global competition, that  they will be so far ahead that the competition also might not matter.\n\nEach to their own, we'll see where it goes. If it all crashes and burns I won't lose anything I can't handle, I took a unique chance with a new sector, did my DD and believe in the stocks I've chosen.

I dont know. but what I do know is that where theres money there will certainly be competitors. \n\n\nAs for valuation, these companies are already valued significantly higher than their revenue...so you actually need to consider that. \n\nfor example, some guy cited stz, theit revenue is 7bln per year and their market cap is only 41bln. theyve been around for a long time. the product itself has been legalized for 100s of years. \n\ncanopy has 40 mil in revenue and is valued at 14bln market cap. so just doing basic comparisons of alcohol to weed, you can see theres a huge difference here...and alcohol is global. about 20x less revenue, but valued at 1/3rd of an established alcohol brand?

I'll read up more on it. \n\nI'd encourage you to do the same on Canopy which is what I talk about here. \n\nI'll answer based on them since them and only them is what I discussed before. \n\n 1.  We'll see. I don't think it'll completely kill the black market but it will to a big extent in every country that legalizes. And based on how much money there is in the black market I'm convinced there'll be a lot of money to work with for the sector leader.\n\nThey look at every part of the world, they've entered where medical has been legalized. (Bought up companies in Germany, Australia, Colombia, builds a European growing base in Denmark).\n\n\nMedical is the first step. It normalizes the drug, changes public opinion. An opioid crisis on that speeds up the process as it gives politicians a strong moral play, turns legalizing into a question not just for anarchocapitalists, libertarians, potheads.  \n\nPurdues opioids leads to deaths here in Sweden as well. The opioid Crysis is global/a diaspora at least in the west. \n\nSweden will be last on the ball though. We're a weird moralistic alarmistic atheistic leftist bunch with leftists and righ wings agreeing on cannabis.\n\nCanopy has been first on every ball. And every nation that goes for medical  has needed to import weed from where the there's know-how and the product has been approved and there's enough of it.\n\n2. They are indeed overvalued. So is every company. But in which way are they overvalued? Future growth is taken into account. But what happens when that growth has been surpassed? What happens when they're doing medical in Malta, Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Australia, South Africa, Colombia, Chile? When these countries afterwarss fully legalize, their  brand is known, their products are already known and used?\n\nNorway has a  political majority for legalizing.  Berlin wants to legalize in their city already. German public opinion is turning. They just patented the productname \"Chronic by DRE\". They look into how u can reach someone who hasn't tried cannabis. Which kind of product would a woman in her fifties try for the first time? Coffee? Drink? Smoke? Pill? Edible? Lotion? Oil? They bought Hiku Brands for a string of products aiming at the young and hipsters.\n\nBased on Canopys strategy so far it's not likely they won't keep on putting their money into investing rather than banking up. \n\n3. Because of the global growth. The industry won't leave. It'll keep on growing. The big fish will eat the little ones, some companies will survive, some will thrive, some will die. Canopy is the biggest fish and a intelligent one hungry for bigger waters, already set up in the waters that are ready for a MJ market.\n\nSo yeah. That's my take on it. Another crash awaits after legalization as hype dies out again, the institutions are down buying up and playing with the volatile stocks. \n\n But why are u so sure it'll be the end? For everyone of them? For most of them sure. But what about those in good positions for legalization, a global market? Was there no Microsoft or Apple within the dotcom bubble? Did every company just die? \n\n\nAnd a big differnece between the dotcombubble and Cannabis is that the product already is out there in a global billion-market. \n\nIt's not like computers were illegal, everyone had tried one at a party in college, Bill Clintons famous quote would be \" I did not inhale the computer\".\n\nAnd another thought.  U mention that everyone's a \"weedstock-guru\" all of a sudden, telling people what to do with the sector. Well aren't u a similar kind of  guru right now?  Speaking of the sector, what will happen to it.\n\nI'm convinced the market will grow globally and some brands will stick out and be known all over the world. and if I had 10k I wouid have invested them into Canopy when it dips. I'm not even invested in them as they're to expensive for me. \n\nMy biggest warning is to people not following the sector. They shouldn't buy in now. Follow the sector and know what the risks and upsides are, don't buy more than u can't lose etc...\n\nMy second warning is to those who don't follow what happens on a global scale. They should keep an eye on what happens in Germany etc cuz over time they will have their own companies competing with the brands Canopy, Aphria, Aurora has bought.  How is that dealt with? I believe they will keep on buying their non-global competition, that  they will be so far ahead that the competition also might not matter.\n\nEach to their own, we'll see where it goes. If it all crashes and burns I won't lose anything I can't handle, I took a unique chance with a new sector, did my DD and believe in the stocks I've chosen.

Then we're two non-gurus discussing a stock sector:).\n\nMaybe we'll turn eachothers perspective a bit. Bring all the questions  on dotcom that u got, cuz I don't know how it went down in detail it's a perspective from which my analysis hasn't been strong enough. U know of any documentarys or litterature about it? Even if I have a different view of the future of the weed sector and the top companies this makes it more of a complete picture. \n\nAbout the overvaluation, I agree. Maybe I worded it badly but as I see it the overvaluation started a year ago and that  they still are. But I also believe that there's  actual value to some if it. Coca Cola in talks with ACB, companies actually following up on the global strategies. On that point there's actually a few midcap companies(OGI, EMH, that's been saying that they don't have global plans(yet). But that yet is ofcourse of importance. But afaik only CRON, APH,   CGC, ACB have gone further than Canada. \n\nThe thing about the competitors is that Canadian companies are so far ahead. They've had medical since 2001, they have the know-how and production facilities. It takes quite a while to catch up, since they're already buying up the biggest companies in other countries MJmarkets I find it hard to see why they'd stop or be unable to keep that up. \n\nThe comparison to alcohol is similar to it being a drug, being world wide. But there's no medical Alcohol. No pain pills. No  similar ways of taking away  THC, only using CBD as a relaxing non-addictive (physically) in drinks, lotions. \n\nIt's still unclear in how many medical areas Cannabis can be used but it's being researched, iirc an american company is closing in on phase three testing on epilepsy.\n\nI take homecooked statistics with a grain of salt:). But it could end up around there when it comes to smoking. It increases though when u add edibles, coffee, beers, lotions, luxury products as variety.  And when u add the medical products.  And Hemp! In health foods, massage oils, plastic replacement.\n\nThe prices are set low enough to not lead people to buying from the black market, but it will of course still exist. How much of it that will remain probably look different in Every country. In Uruguay the prices are kept very low to outcompete the black market, in Canada it's been a  main part of Trudeas plans to fight the main income of criminal gangs, so they won't go for overtaxing or overpricing.\n + People prefer a legal drug where they know what kind of effect the drugs will give rather than illegally buying a product u don't know where it's been, if it's gonna bring u up or down. The paranoia effects are easier dealt with when the product is legal, u don't have to worry about it.  \n\nAlso u need to add medical maruijana in Germany(80million) to your statistics. And as public opinion turns on weed, I believe we within the coming 5 years will see it become legalised there.

", "parent_text": "Allright my bad. Then we're two non-gurus discussing a stock sector:).\n\nMaybe we'll turn eachothers perspective a bit. Bring all the questions  on dotcom that u got, cuz I don't know how it went down in detail it's a perspective from which my analysis hasn't been strong enough. U know of any documentarys or litterature about it? Even if I have a different view of the future of the weed sector and the top companies this makes it more of a complete picture. \n\nAbout the overvaluation, I agree. Maybe I worded it badly but as I see it the overvaluation started a year ago and that  they still are. But I also believe that there's  actual value to some if it. Coca Cola in talks with ACB, companies actually following up on the global strategies. On that point there's actually a few midcap companies(OGI, EMH, that's been saying that they don't have global plans(yet). But that yet is ofcourse of importance. But afaik only CRON, APH,   CGC, ACB have gone further than Canada. \n\nThe thing about the competitors is that Canadian companies are so far ahead. They've had medical since 2001, they have the know-how and production facilities. It takes quite a while to catch up, since they're already buying up the biggest companies in other countries MJmarkets I find it hard to see why they'd stop or be unable to keep that up. \n\nThe comparison to alcohol is similar to it being a drug, being world wide. But there's no medical Alcohol. No pain pills. No  similar ways of taking away  THC, only using CBD as a relaxing non-addictive (physically) in drinks, lotions. \n\nIt's still unclear in how many medical areas Cannabis can be used but it's being researched, iirc an american company is closing in on phase three testing on epilepsy.\n\nI take homecooked statistics with a grain of salt:). But it could end up around there when it comes to smoking. It increases though when u add edibles, coffee, beers, lotions, luxury products as variety.  And when u add the medical products.  And Hemp! In health foods, massage oils, plastic replacement.\n\nThe prices are set low enough to not lead people to buying from the black market, but it will of course still exist. How much of it that will remain probably look different in Every country. In Uruguay the prices are kept very low to outcompete the black market, in Canada it's been a  main part of Trudeas plans to fight the main income of criminal gangs, so they won't go for overtaxing or overpricing.\n + People prefer a legal drug where they know what kind of effect the drugs will give rather than illegally buying a product u don't know where it's been, if it's gonna bring u up or down. The paranoia effects are easier dealt with when the product is legal, u don't have to worry about it.  \n\nAlso u need to add medical maruijana in Germany(80million) to your statistics. And as public opinion turns on weed, I believe we within the coming 5 years will see it become legalised there.

All fb has to do is maintain its previous earnings and boom you should have people buying back in.\n\nI think FB can be priced like google and amzn.
