So by doing the opposite of the market there is a lot of potential profit to be made. \n\nThe only point to this post really is to get some people thinking critically about earnings releases and the price action that proceeds them, and instead of only thinking of buying or selling before earnings, start thinking about buying or selling after earnings to take advantage of the downfalls in our own natural psychology and biases. \n\nEarnings season has only just begun, but to give you an idea of places to start, GS is the perfect example of quick easy money after earnings. I sold a credit spread on the 17th and closed for 95% of the credit profit on the 22nd. IBM has also panned out well but I haven't quite closed that one yet. Looking forward, I'm keeping an eye out on PG and JNJ today, as well as already having opened a position in AXP.\n\nHope this gives you something to think about, and I'm sure you'll be able to find many opportunities that I didn't list and that I may not even be aware of. Good luck!

If you are a small technology or biopharma company (really any industry, but these are the most active) with any sort of promise, you can get VC money pretty easily relative to the past. Look at Uber, Spotify, FB -- they are / were  able to get huge. SoftBank fund has 100bn alone to throw around.\n\n(2) M&A. You may get acquired before you even think about going public. Ex. Unilever -> Dollar Shave Club. \n\nDon't have to hire investment bankers, lawyers to draft an IPO. Don't have to publish SEC filings. The incentives are weaker today for great small companies to be public.\n\nJust some of my thoughts.\n\nI also think we are hitting a business cycle where scale and access to large sets of proprietary data are more important than ever (see FANG dominance). We are inching closer to oligopoly in many sectors. Amazon eating the world. Kraft Heinz merger. Kraft Heinz going after Unilever. AT&T Time Warner. CVS- Aetna, etc \n\nThe sector I see small caps being the most successful in is energy. Don't need network effects, don't need big data. Just need a good acreage. Shale investment is relatively cheap.

It burned $3.3 million in the quarter, but in the 10Q we see that $1.9 million was spend on development of the mobile app and another $300,000 was for a prepayment of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Excluding these costs, management claims it is burning about $300,000 a month. Given that the software development costs will decline significantly once the apps are finished, we are encouraged that the company could reach cash breakeven as it said by the end of 2018. If we assume the company chooses to raise $6 million in equity to mitigate cash burn, this equates to another 1.5 million shares at $4.00 per share.
