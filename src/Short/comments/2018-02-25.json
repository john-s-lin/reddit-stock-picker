We are so so so far off the days when companies are going to bring in billions of profits / make much of a difference at all to daily life. I would say maybe 20+ years before we even see single digit % growth in actual profits from AI implication.\n\nHowever, there is one area of AI that is almost a separate thing entirely and people get confused - Autonomy. This is not really AI, rather Input being placed into code and sorted automatically, to get a desired output in the form of data / trend identification. It has extended uses like Autonomous driving, defense technology and so on. This is where the money is currently. Data centres and big data / statistics are very very valuable to companies. There is but one single stock that has a dominant moat and that is Nvidia - their eco system and chips are so far ahead of the rest of the industry it's like an F1 Ferrari vs 3 legged donkey. \n\nThey also control and recently open sourced their eco system, meaning developers in the space have no need for anything else, and no worry about scaling costs. Startups and blue chips are using Nvidia hardware and software to *research* and build for all manner of AI advancement. The payoff for them will come in the mid to long term future.\n\nThe stock currently has a high P/E in the 40-50 range, but actual future profit is potentially the most profitable company we will ever see given the extent of their moat. \n\n\n", "score": 6, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 79, "submission_ratio": 0.0759493670886076, "submission_title": "$ROBT - New A.I. & Robotics ETF", "submission_text": "I feel very optimistic about A.I.'s future and it seems like this new $ROBT ETF has exposure to the industry that $BOTZ just doesn't.

The best and most efficient way to hold REITs is in a tax advantaged account like an IRA.
