It's starting to be used outside of gaming more often now too for stuff like therapies, job training, personal entertainment (you can be watching a movie in your own personal theatre on a plane, etc.). It really does take you to another place, and while it removes you from your immediate physical environment, which some may seem as isolating, it does bring an entirely new dimension to remote social interactions (for example, if you ever try social stuff like Bigscreen VR, Rec Room, VR Chat, invite friends into your Oculus Home, etc. you really do start to feel like someone is right there next to you, because you get some of that body language and 3 dimensionality, etc. missing from video, chat, or voice only).\n\nAR has a lot more hype around it right now, since it still isn't at a consumer level yet. Consumers and businesses can get a peak through a window at it using smartphone style AR, which doesn't really give a sense of what its potential. Holding up a phone is still merely interacting mostly in 2d, which isn't very different than what people have been doing for years on electronic devices. A lot of people overlook a couple weaknesses in regards to AR too; due to the nature of AR being based on purely on local physical environment, it's weak when it comes to remote interaction, where VR is strong (i.e. you can toss up a new wallpaper in a cubical sized space using AR, but to cross beyond those walls and expand beyond your physically limited space, you cross over into VR, as you have to simulate the environment beyond those walls in order to move beyond them; 360 video, regardless of being shown using an AR device like the Hololens/Magic Leap/etc. or on a dedicated VR headset is still a VR experience, as it's replacing the environment around you completely), so it isn't all or nothing between AR and VR.\n\nAI is also another big area, which at the moment can require massive amounts of data to develop.

A lot of people still don't understand all the potential use cases and even just to get excited for it's use cases within gaming you have to try it to really get it. It's starting to be used outside of gaming more often now too for stuff like therapies, job training, personal entertainment (you can be watching a movie in your own personal theatre on a plane, etc.). It really does take you to another place, and while it removes you from your immediate physical environment, which some may seem as isolating, it does bring an entirely new dimension to remote social interactions (for example, if you ever try social stuff like Bigscreen VR, Rec Room, VR Chat, invite friends into your Oculus Home, etc. you really do start to feel like someone is right there next to you, because you get some of that body language and 3 dimensionality, etc. missing from video, chat, or voice only).\n\nAR has a lot more hype around it right now, since it still isn't at a consumer level yet. Consumers and businesses can get a peak through a window at it using smartphone style AR, which doesn't really give a sense of what its potential. Holding up a phone is still merely interacting mostly in 2d, which isn't very different than what people have been doing for years on electronic devices. A lot of people overlook a couple weaknesses in regards to AR too; due to the nature of AR being based on purely on local physical environment, it's weak when it comes to remote interaction, where VR is strong (i.e. you can toss up a new wallpaper in a cubical sized space using AR, but to cross beyond those walls and expand beyond your physically limited space, you cross over into VR, as you have to simulate the environment beyond those walls in order to move beyond them; 360 video, regardless of being shown using an AR device like the Hololens/Magic Leap/etc. or on a dedicated VR headset is still a VR experience, as it's replacing the environment around you completely), so it isn't all or nothing between AR and VR.\n\nAI is also another big area, which at the moment can require massive amounts of data to develop.

They certainly have a good headstart on everyone with some impressive tech being developed and the Rift is still holding up pretty well too with the standalone \"Santa Cruz\" being released soon too.

There are too many steps and you simply cannot stay on it for a prolonged period of time without feeling physically uncomfortable. The headsets will HAVE to become the size of sunglasses for the tech to truly be as prolific as the smart phone. Otherwise I see the utility in this tech being purely technical and not for entertainment. Entertainment has to be easy. \n\nIt doesn't seem like you've tried it (no, cardboard level VR doesn't count). Most who pick up a headset end up not really playing standard flat games nearly as much. There are also a surprising amount of more elderly people that end up playing games in VR that would otherwise not even touch gaming. SteamVR monthly active users has grown over 160% year over year and continues to increase (this includes many Oculus Rift users too). PSVR has been growing by about 1 million users about every 8 months since launch. Sony is putting a lot more into PSVR recently too with several announcements of games and other development on the platform.\n\nActually, once you try it, you find that it really doesn't require very much effort at all and that the perception from the outside isn't as true as it first seems. There are some issues that need to be worked on before we see true mainstream adoption (gamers are already convinced for the most part, education, and other sectors are following too; just do some research and you'll see all the development and uses already out there from several universities using the tech to provide more lab time for students, to airlines using it for entertainment purposes, Wal-Mart just ordered like 17k Oculus Go headsets to use for training employees, and many other examples of VR adoption).\n\nWill it be Facebook and Oculus that leads the way in the future, becoming the go to brand for VR/AR? They certainly have a good headstart on everyone with some impressive tech being developed and the Rift is still holding up pretty well too with the standalone \"Santa Cruz\" being released soon too.

The company seems to think it can just pull whatever films or shows it wants from its lineup, experiment with mandatory advertisements (which had a huge public opinion backlash), and create lackluster content. If you look at Hulu, they have a far better lineup of content, in house produced and otherwise for a more affordable price. The only thing Netflix has over Hulu is the amount of movies available as compared to TV shows. However People often struggle to find films on Netflix because they don\u2019t have most classics or most good films in general. All they have is a few good movies they managed to license along with a huge gorge of their laughably shitty low budget content. Netflix is a huge household name in the entertainment sector no doubt, and they have a big advantage by being established in a market that is poised for growth when cable tv really starts to die. It\u2019s just my opinion however that for a new content streaming service to come along and hugely disrupt their market would not be very hard, and that public opinion of Netflix is going to continue to decline in the next few years. Being the successful big household name doesn\u2019t guarantee long term stability if the company doesn\u2019t care about adapting and outcompeting.\nBut that\u2019s just my 2\u00a2.

And pretty rich of you to accuse me of emotional bias when you are portraying that yourself. \n\nAnd we are all here to make money, and Disney IS NOT something that can do that at the moment.

Purchasing a call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying at the strike price at any time you choose up until the expiration date.  As you might expect, the base price of an option is the difference between the current price and the strike price.  So if the stock is worth $10 right now and the call strike price is $5, the option is worth at least $5.  We call this intrinsic value.  If there is still time remaining before expiration, there will be some additional value above the intrinsic value.  We call this time value.\n\nOptions give you leverage.   That is to say, the % change in the option price will be greater than the % change in the underlying price.  The price you pay for this leverage is risk.  If a stock goes down a few bucks, it isn't a good thing but you still have value and you can wait for the stock to recover eventually.  But if the stock price is lower/higher than your call/put strike price when the option expires, it will be worthless.  This happens very often.  They are complicated and risky and you should paper trade for a long time before even thinking about trading for real.  To be consistently successful with options requires careful planning and analysis.  \n\nWhen you short a stock, you borrow it from someone else (usually your broker) so you can sell it.  You promise to give back the same number of shares at a later date.  If the stock falls, you capture the difference.  You pay a fee to whoever lent you the shares, which is their incentive to make them available.  \n\nIn order to day trade, you need at least $25,000.

", "parent_text": "An option has a strike price and an expiration date.  Purchasing a call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying at the strike price at any time you choose up until the expiration date.  As you might expect, the base price of an option is the difference between the current price and the strike price.  So if the stock is worth $10 right now and the call strike price is $5, the option is worth at least $5.  We call this intrinsic value.  If there is still time remaining before expiration, there will be some additional value above the intrinsic value.  We call this time value.\n\nOptions give you leverage.   That is to say, the % change in the option price will be greater than the % change in the underlying price.  The price you pay for this leverage is risk.  If a stock goes down a few bucks, it isn't a good thing but you still have value and you can wait for the stock to recover eventually.  But if the stock price is lower/higher than your call/put strike price when the option expires, it will be worthless.  This happens very often.  They are complicated and risky and you should paper trade for a long time before even thinking about trading for real.  To be consistently successful with options requires careful planning and analysis.  \n\nWhen you short a stock, you borrow it from someone else (usually your broker) so you can sell it.  You promise to give back the same number of shares at a later date.  If the stock falls, you capture the difference.  You pay a fee to whoever lent you the shares, which is their incentive to make them available.  \n\nIn order to day trade, you need at least $25,000.

Have a lot cash on hand and buying back stocks\n3. Their newest chip for the smart watch is the best in the market right now.  Smart Watch is next big thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason why QCOM stock may fail:\n\n1. Average consumer does not recognize or differentiate their brand from other brands and thus they are at the mercy of phone makers and smart watch makers.\n2. A lot money and power comes from patents. They are mercy of patent rulings and regulations.\n3. They are not diversified\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, in my estimate they are good buy for now and they will be good buy for at least for couple of years.
