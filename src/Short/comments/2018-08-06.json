They both trade and pay dividends in US dollars, allowing investors to avoid transacting in a foreign currency. ADRs exist due to the difficulties of buying shares in foreign countries and dealing with currency exchange rates when making various transactions. ADRs allow US banks to purchase a bulk of shares from a foreign company, and bundle those shares for the purpose of being reissued on U.S. stock markets, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. If you're based in the US and looking to trade shares of a foreign company, go with an ADR. Logistically, it will be much easier.\n\nAdditionally ADRs can be sponsored and unsponsored, and if they're sponsored, it means that they've entered into an agreement directly with the U.S. depositary bank to make plans for record keeping, distribution of shareholder communications, payment of dividends (some ADRs are dividend-paying stocks) and other services. These sponsored ADRs can be listed on major exchanges.\n\nWithout delving into too much detail, ADRs are also categorized by level, depending on how much the company has accessed the US markets. If you'd like, you can read more on how level I, II, and III level ADRs differ; basically, the higher level the ADR is, the more the company has accessed US markets.\n\nFor you, ADRs can be advantageous because they allow you to buy shares of a foreign company, while considerably reducing administrative costs and bypassing foreign taxes on each transaction. These foreign companies like ADRs because they give them more access to the American market.

Thanks in Advance", "parent_text": "Great question.\n\nAn ADR stands for American Depositary Receipt, which is essentially a non-US company that trades in US financial markets. They both trade and pay dividends in US dollars, allowing investors to avoid transacting in a foreign currency. ADRs exist due to the difficulties of buying shares in foreign countries and dealing with currency exchange rates when making various transactions. ADRs allow US banks to purchase a bulk of shares from a foreign company, and bundle those shares for the purpose of being reissued on U.S. stock markets, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. If you're based in the US and looking to trade shares of a foreign company, go with an ADR. Logistically, it will be much easier.\n\nAdditionally ADRs can be sponsored and unsponsored, and if they're sponsored, it means that they've entered into an agreement directly with the U.S. depositary bank to make plans for record keeping, distribution of shareholder communications, payment of dividends (some ADRs are dividend-paying stocks) and other services. These sponsored ADRs can be listed on major exchanges.\n\nWithout delving into too much detail, ADRs are also categorized by level, depending on how much the company has accessed the US markets. If you'd like, you can read more on how level I, II, and III level ADRs differ; basically, the higher level the ADR is, the more the company has accessed US markets.\n\nFor you, ADRs can be advantageous because they allow you to buy shares of a foreign company, while considerably reducing administrative costs and bypassing foreign taxes on each transaction. These foreign companies like ADRs because they give them more access to the American market.
