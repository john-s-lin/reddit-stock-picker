Immelt acquired companies when they were expensive and they made almost no money for GE and tried buying real estate for the company before the 2008 collapse. Literally the worst timing possible.

Flannery, the current CEO, hasn't promised to not cut the dividend again. \n\nThey're trying to return to their core strengths of aviation, power, and healthcare. Their aviation contract with Boeing is huge and Boeing is on a fucking tear in the market right now (I read UPS annual report today and they've ordered Boeing 747-8s and have 11 767s on backorder between 2019 and 2021. GE will more than likely make their engines and that's going to be steady and large income for the next few years). Healthcare will be a consistently powerful field with a steadily aging population. And then there's power, which has decreased by 40% as a sector. I'm bullish on the stock. Because I'm a buy-and-forget-you-own-it investor so I'm fine with them playing it out in their mess.

In that case, the market experienced some decent dips and volatility leading up to the climax followed by a nice recovery and run to only to be slammed with dot.com bubble later on. Nothing too extreme occurred but the news and impeachment trial did have effects on the market, although probably not as noticeable as many anticipated. However, the Clinton fiasco likely had minimal impact on that crash for the most part overall. The economy at the time was doing pretty well and people were pretty optimistic about it despite all the craziness going on.\n\nWatergate was a bit different. It occurred during a period of a tough market, high oil prices, and high inflation. Simply put, the market wasn\u2019t in great shape to begin with at the time of it and it was in different shoes than what it is today. During the lead up and climax of Watergate, the market tanked quite a bit. 1974 was a really bad year for the stock market and the rest of the decade was pretty wild market wise.\n\nThe only other comparison I can think of is with the JFK assassination. Stocks dipped a little bit but quickly recovered following the immediate aftermath of it. This is actually pretty impressive as there was a lot to uncertainty and paranoia around it during the Cold War period. The market would go on to continue having a bull market. \n\nI think with the current administration, it will be somewhere in the middle if the charges are found to be valid and deal with some of the more serious charges. I think if a trial or impeachment process is started then we\u2019ll see some volatility and dips as news comes out each day. You have to remember that people are far more connected today with the internet, social media, and other platforms which can be both good and bad. We\u2019ve also seen how the current market can be pretty sensitive to news as well. I also don\u2019t think our current president would go out quietly or without show either which may add to things. It will be interesting if something like you say does occur.\n\nA lot probably depends on what charges he faces if prosecutors believe they are warranted in addition to how congress reacts. Something like money laundering, instances of corruption, or benefiting off kick backs? Probably won\u2019t move the needle too much with the market in the end. Actual collusion and relationships with the Russians may be far nastier.\n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to look at it from the public\u2019s standpoint. Trump has had a ton of coverage, news, and criticism since the day he declared his run for presidency. He\u2019s been plagued with storylines and accusations. He\u2019s been criticized, bashed, and disliked for awhile now. Some of this is probably deserved and warranted while at other times it\u2019s probably not. Yet, nothing has stuck and occurred. The question is if the American public has become numb to this news. How many times have they been told \u201cthis is the last straw\u201d or \u201cthis is the one that will do him in\u201d only to be proven wrong. If our president does end up facing something t like impeachment, will the storyline be stale at that point and the public numb enough that it influences the market fairly little? Will it have already been priced in and expected by that point already?\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the market (and people!) often act irrationally. Sometimes what you think would happen doesn\u2019t and this is perhaps no truer than with investing. We\u2019re in a bull market that has had an spectacular and incredibly long run. The fundamentals are all there and solid for the most part despite all the craziness. These factors could perhaps potentially help bare the brunt of such a scenario if they remain solid. Yet, trying to predict this stuff is very difficult. If you sell now and go to cash, you risk losing out if the run continues or nothing dramatic happens. The best thing to do is to probably make a sound game plan and stick with it regardless how all this plays out.", "score": 6, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "What will the market do if Trump is indicted?", "submission_text": "Starting to look like a genuine possibility now.

There is a chance that you will get lucky and your stock will skyrocket, but keep in mind that the stock that you buy, somebody is selling. If the other person is rational, they think its better to sell it now that keep it.     \nI wasn't the best student at uni, but as I understand in a nutshell, the stock price is not what the company is NOW, its what it is now + all the anticipation based on all publicly known information. Basically, when you buy a stock for a set price, and you read good news about the stock, the stock is already the good news within its price. If you know something others don't then you have an advantage, but remember, insider trading is illegal.     \nOverall, as I understand, trading stocks like wolf of Wallstreet is not really a thing, you try to beat the market, but when you buy something, others are trying to beat the market by selling to you. As I understand 97% of the active traders are underperforming the market average return on investment if you add transaction fees, and the most of the remaining 3% is there due to survivors bias. Treat this more like a fun gamble, where, on average, you should have a positive profit, but not as much as investing in market average, like index funds.      \nRegardless, I dont know much, its just how I undrstand all of this with my limited knowledge, don't go and put all of your money on index funds because a guy in Reddit said so. ;)", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Any tips for starting off in investing and trading?", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Any tips for starting off in investing and trading?
