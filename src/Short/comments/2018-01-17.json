The market could always open lower, for example. But yes, in most cases it should keep you safe from a portfolio destroying correction. You'll want to raise your stop loss quite often to protect your gains though.\n\nSecondly, 10% corrections happen fairly often with $TQQQ. There was a 15% pull back in July, and then at the end of November there was around a 10% pullback. 5%-8% pull backs happen every couple of months even in the current bull market. Something to consider is that if the market doesn't do as well as it has been over the last few years this strategy could have you repeatedly buying in at the highs then triggering stop losses at the lows. In my experience you want to be selling when it's green, which is why I personally take almost the complete opposite approach and sell when it rallies then buy when it drops. \n\nBut to tell you the truth I think this strategy is likely to work if the market continues to be as bullish as it has been over the last few years. Then again, almost any strategy would work in the current market. I guess it depends on if you expect that to continue.\n\nFinally some food for thought, the 10 day RSI and 20 day SMA make $TQQQ look extremely likely to correct over the next couple of weeks in my opinion. In that event a 10% drop seems likely. For me to start buying into $TQQQ currently I'd be looking for an opening at around $155 and then I'd really start dumping money in at $150. The fact I think this is fairly likely to happen and that's the price you'd be bailing out is perhaps a little worrying.

GE has been the worst performing Dow stock for 17 years or so.\n\nThis has been a long, steady slide for well over a decade under Immelt and now new management (CEO was a high ranking exec throughout Immelt's time) is trying to right a ship that has been off course for more than a decade and a half. \n\nPeople keep asking about this as if it's going to fix things overnight. What Immelt did is not going to be fixed, this is going to be broken up (and current management was acting like they were going to take years to try and fix it until the news from a couple of days ago) and you have some analysts this week discussing the sum of the parts value is less than the current price. Maybe they figure some financial engineering nonsense out by the Spring but I don't have confidence and I don't really care; I really have a strong belief in not investing with very poor management and Immelt was the dictionary definition of that. 16 years of Immelt allowed to set in resulted in rot at GE.

I'm using the seasonal edge myself and already have a good 30 picks lined up over the year.  I would actually use a few 1% of my portfolio on some of these picks just for fun and keep reinvesting.  However my strategy is buy and sell within 2-5 months which would be a bigger profit and have a higher probability of success although I use only the past 3 years as performance indicator.  Looking at ULTA, I would buy around the 1st week of Feb and let it free ride, placing a stop limit on June 1st and potentially riding it out through August for a average 41% profit.  Actually that's now on my 5% buy list.\n\nAs helpful as this is, even if you posted the results there would still be some kind of negative feedback.  It's really sad but that's the way it is.

Or, at least, the mantra \"correlation doesn't equal causation\"? Seasonality can't just be drawn from \"X has done well in this week for several years, so will again\". Seasonality perhaps makes sense when it can be connected to the given season/time. What you're doing is just taking past performance as an indication of future returns which *is the definition of what one should not do*.\n\nEDIT2 - I just checked, for NFLX (continuing the example) this is about the timeframe when they report Q4 earnings. So, your method has effectively yielded the play of \"bet on Netflix earnings\". That's been a good play, to date, as a company with a stock that's yielded 48% total returns since 2008.

So, your method has effectively yielded the play of \"bet on Netflix earnings\". That's been a good play, to date, as a company with a stock that's yielded 48% total returns since 2008.
