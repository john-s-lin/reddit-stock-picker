Dangerous right?\n\nPremarket has been known to bounce prices around a lot, it can be helpful in pointing the direction it might open at but it\u2019s not always the key indicator of \u201cwill today be red or green day\u201d", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 1, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "Question about large stock price change right on market open.", "submission_text": "Noob question: Take for example TSLA closes 9/27/2018 at $307 and drops 11% lower the instant the market opens on 9/28/2018.\n\nDoes this happen because during the off trading hours people hear bad news and decide they want to sell at 'market' price and place orders before market open while at the same time buyers have set their limit orders to around $278 (also before market open).\n\nI guess without some sort of bad news over the night have buyers placing limit orders at prices closer to previous days close?\n\nIs that more or less what happens when you see these huge drops that basically happens the instant the market opens?  I guess the reverse is true for instant jumps.  Lots of people placing orders to buy \"at market price\" while sellers set their limit orders much higher.", "parent_text": "> sellers who panic sell bad news have to sell at limit orders in most cases due to lack of liquidity.\n\nHmm if I'm following, they place before-open limit orders at a price much lower than previous close and hope that they get filled at a higher  market price on open or at least their low limit price. I guess it's possible the price drops below their limit right? And the trade doesnt happen.\n\nSo if I read limit vs market correctly you can't place market orders when the market is closed or a stock is halted, which means you can only place orders to buy or sell at a specified price at those times.\n\n", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1538330610.0, "submission_id": "9k8gi5", "comment_id": "e6x4pe6", "body": "Single most important player in the global economy rn", "score": 20, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 10.0, "submission_title": "How important is the US to the global economy?", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "How important is the US to the global economy?

If you were one of my subscribers you would have made....\"\n\nI forget what the stock was though.\n\nBut there you have it.\n\nSold 250,000 subscriptions over the course of a year.\n\nWhat a lot of people don't know is that the copywriters usually get 3% to 5% of subscription sales on top of either their salary (if in-house) or a base fee of around $10,000 if they are a freelancer.\n\nTypically that comes out to about $2 or so per signup for the front end products (more for more expensive backend upsells).\n\nSo writing a successful promotion means HUGE money and sometimes they can run for years so it can create passive income.\n\nSo the incentive of copywriters is to sell, they don't really care how sound the pick is.\n\nMotley Fool may have a good track record (which seems to be the case of some commentors) but they operate the same.\n\nThe thing is, their track record really isn't much different from any other advisories.\n\nThey essentially all fucking copy each other's picks.\n\nOne guy here mentioned a few picks like Nvidia that he banked on with MF.\n\nBut that same pick has been floating around EVERY newsletter rotation including Money Map Press by Bill Patalon.\n\nNot only that, the promotions to get people to sign up are basically just ripped from whatever newsletter's promotion is working best, especially competitors.\n\nAnd often even competing newsletters work together to rent each other's lists to write what are called \"Insert Ads.\"\n\nIt's all very incestuous.\n\nCopywriters are always jumping from newsletter to newsletter -- Oxford Club for a few years here now Motley Fool, then over at Agora Financial...etc.", "score": 4, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 149, "submission_ratio": 0.026845637583892617, "submission_title": "2 months ago I posted a Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendation, $BB(Blackberry) and the post got no love.

Down over 75% since.\n* CVS in February 2014, at $65. It's up about 20% since, but the S&P is up almost 75%.\n* FEYE twice in 2015, at $47 and $53. Currently trades around $17. S&P is up about 48% since.\n* DPLO in August 2015, at $40. Down 50% since.\n* CLB in April 2014 at $197. Down about 40% since; S&P is up 70%.\n\nThey've rec'd some winners as well.\n\n* SHW in June 2014, at $195. Currently around $460.\n* XPO in January 2015, at $38. Currently $113.\n* STMP in May 2016, at $81. Currently $220.\n* PAYC in June 2017 at $69; again in January 2018 at $91. Currently $153.\n* MA twice in 2013 at $50 and $55; again in 2016 at $102. Currently $224.\n\nEyeballing the results of their recommendations since October 2013 (generally two per month, excluding the \"Best Buys Now\" each month), I'd say between 50 and 60% have outperformed the S&P since the date of the rec. In some cases, it's by a lot; in some cases, we're talking within single digit percentage points (TSCO, BRK.B, CASY).\n\nFrom reading their due diligence and buy recs, it's clear that they buy into what they see as visionary executives carrying out disruptive or innovative business plans. They published a spotlight article about Tesla this weekend that advised staying the course, and even filling out a position for those that can take the volatility, partially because they believe in Musk (Tesla was a Stock Advisor pick in 2012). They're high on Shopify, Stitch Fix, and The Trade Desk in no small part because of Tobias Lutke, Katrina Lake, and Jeff Green.\n\nHaving said all that: they absolutely do try to upsell me on new shit once every other month or so. They'll put together a fancy video talking about how they've discovered where to find the best market-beating returns and the like, and then ask for several thousand dollars for one year of access to this new, exclusive portfolio. They'll usually toss in access to some of their other more expensive services as well to try to bring down the sticker shock. Since I started my subscription earlier this year, there's been:\n\n* A biotech portfolio\n* A microcap portfolio\n* A \"partnership\" portfolio of companies where the founder or management team has significant ownership\n* A portfolio of \"totally international\" stocks that aren't listed in the US\n* Another sell on the microcap portfolio\n* There's one later this week that looks to be related to marijuana.\n\nOf those, the biotech one was the least expensive, and it was $1500 or $2000. The international one was the biggest upsell--something like $4000.\n\nTL;DR: Stock Advisor (probably Rule Breakers too) isn't too bad. The Gardner brothers do some pretty good DD, and they're consistent with their buy and hold mantra to the point beyond which some of us would be comfortable (they doubled down on KMI the week after the dividend cut in 2015 and haven't issued sell calls for any of the losers I listed above).

Down over 75% since.\n* CVS in February 2014, at $65. It's up about 20% since, but the S&P is up almost 75%.\n* FEYE twice in 2015, at $47 and $53. Currently trades around $17. S&P is up about 48% since.\n* DPLO in August 2015, at $40. Down 50% since.\n* CLB in April 2014 at $197. Down about 40% since; S&P is up 70%.\n\nThey've rec'd some winners as well.\n\n* SHW in June 2014, at $195. Currently around $460.\n* XPO in January 2015, at $38. Currently $113.\n* STMP in May 2016, at $81. Currently $220.\n* PAYC in June 2017 at $69; again in January 2018 at $91. Currently $153.\n* MA twice in 2013 at $50 and $55; again in 2016 at $102. Currently $224.\n\nEyeballing the results of their recommendations since October 2013 (generally two per month, excluding the \"Best Buys Now\" each month), I'd say between 50 and 60% have outperformed the S&P since the date of the rec. In some cases, it's by a lot; in some cases, we're talking within single digit percentage points (TSCO, BRK.B, CASY).\n\nFrom reading their due diligence and buy recs, it's clear that they buy into what they see as visionary executives carrying out disruptive or innovative business plans. They published a spotlight article about Tesla this weekend that advised staying the course, and even filling out a position for those that can take the volatility, partially because they believe in Musk (Tesla was a Stock Advisor pick in 2012). They're high on Shopify, Stitch Fix, and The Trade Desk in no small part because of Tobias Lutke, Katrina Lake, and Jeff Green.\n\nHaving said all that: they absolutely do try to upsell me on new shit once every other month or so. They'll put together a fancy video talking about how they've discovered where to find the best market-beating returns and the like, and then ask for several thousand dollars for one year of access to this new, exclusive portfolio. They'll usually toss in access to some of their other more expensive services as well to try to bring down the sticker shock. Since I started my subscription earlier this year, there's been:\n\n* A biotech portfolio\n* A microcap portfolio\n* A \"partnership\" portfolio of companies where the founder or management team has significant ownership\n* A portfolio of \"totally international\" stocks that aren't listed in the US\n* Another sell on the microcap portfolio\n* There's one later this week that looks to be related to marijuana.\n\nOf those, the biotech one was the least expensive, and it was $1500 or $2000. The international one was the biggest upsell--something like $4000.\n\nTL;DR: Stock Advisor (probably Rule Breakers too) isn't too bad. The Gardner brothers do some pretty good DD, and they're consistent with their buy and hold mantra to the point beyond which some of us would be comfortable (they doubled down on KMI the week after the dividend cut in 2015 and haven't issued sell calls for any of the losers I listed above).

Publishers have copy divisions and also hire freelancers. And nine times out of ten, the ridiculous claims come from the writers, not the editors.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\>Copy should invoke greed or fear, I was told early on in my days as a copywriter. And the easiest way to elicit greed from our readers is to exaggerate the upside and hide the downside. But exaggeration isn\u2019t the only problematic aspect of promos.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\>Also be aware when a promo touts an editor\u2019s past picks by saying things like \u2018my readers had access to\u2019 or \u2018had the opportunity to bank a gain of\u2026\u2019 Often this means the editor published a sell recommendation and the stock continued to climb. So the official portfolio will show a much smaller gain than what the promo is advertising.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\>This business is dominated by copy. It\u2019s a business of ad men. They are selling you stories\u2026 selling you dreams, greed, and fear. It\u2019s not the business of financial geniuses. The main focus of their business is on selling, not on delivering results. If it were otherwise, there would employ fewer copywriters and a lot more analysts.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\>To that end, sometimes the \u2018big idea\u2019 of the promo comes first, and whatever stock happens to fit the story will work, regardless of whether it is a good investment or not. **\\*\\*In fact, I had one editor who asked what stocks I thought should be the subject of the promo\u2019s tease. Keep in mind, I had no financial education or experience heading into this job.\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me pause here for a second because this is a BIG one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, the act of selling new subscriptions is SO much more important than the actual \"analyst\" or editor or \"guru\" or whatever you want to refer to them as...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat the copywriter will actually come up with an idea to sell a promotion, and then the analyst will literally just go out and try to find some stock that fits \"good enough\" to provide the reader with in the \"special report\" (which is not written by the analyst).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so common it's ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little while back Lithium and Cobalt were HOT -- everybody was tlaking about a supply crunch and electric cars and lithium ion batteries and yadda-yadda.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I was asked to write a promotion around Cobalt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only problem is that the analyst in charge of the Energy Investing Newsletter didn't have any Cobalt investments listed, hadn't looked into it or anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...but this Cobalt promo was good, people wanted it, and it was going to sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the analyst says \"Give me a couple of days\" pokes around and finds something that \"works good enough\" and then got the editorial team to write a \"special report.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I write the promotion, tease this \"big cobalt super-play set to make you a millionaire during the electric car revolution\" and they get this \"FREE REPORT for just trying out our research!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing the analyst did was go out and find some Cobalt-related investment that worked \"Good enough\" the rest was written (and driven) by people who had no fucking clue about any of this bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's what you're paying for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**>\\*\\*When I asked a writer who had been in the business for longer if he ever picked stocks based on the bevy of free editorial information we had access to he laughed and said that he learned early on to not get caught up in the hype. The owner of the company and others referred to it as \u2018drinking the kool-aid.\u2019\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe payers are drinking the kool-aid. The copywriters driving sales to these \"model portfolios\" will not even fucking touch this stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're going to want to tell yourself \"Motley Fool is Different!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Dr. Robert Cialdini revealed in his book \"Influence\" which we copywriters use as a sort of Bible, people will do anything to be consistent with their past actions (this is the \"Commitment/Consistency Bias I talked about earlier).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, researchers find that someone betting on a horse is very unsure of their decision 30 seconds before they make it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut once they make it they instantly become 100% certain they have made the right decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen someone pays for something especially, or has devoted time and effort and \"sunk cost\" into something, they are even more likely to double-down on their past decisions in order to remain consistent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if you've bought something form Motley Fool before or have \"championed them\" to other people by recommending them, you will likely fall victim to this same psychological principle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn light of all the evidence to the contrary, you will say to yourself, \"But Motley Fool is DIFFERENT and I know this and I have made a good decision.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were you I'd try a little experiment. For example, if you're interested in Options Selling, find several Options advisories for several competing (reputable) advisories with equally impressive analysts putting their faces on it and subscribe to each one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe same goes for Dividend Income Investing...small-cap growth stocks...value investing...commodities...whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you will see is almost the exact same recommendations for each across all the advisories you subscribe to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, this industry is incredibly incestuous.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 149, "submission_ratio": 0.006711409395973154, "submission_title": "2 months ago I posted a Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendation, $BB(Blackberry) and the post got no love.

Motley Fool is a direct marketing publisher of financial advisory products. They hire people (\"gurus\") to name-brand their various financial ADVISORIES and then issue the regular SEC-required statement that \"This is isn't financial advice, I am not a financial adviser\" blah blah blah. \n\nBut these \"analysits\" are ADVISING paid subscribers on financial decisions. Period. \nAgain, be as pedantic about it as you want, but that is literally what is happening. \n\nI know this industry better than you. I don't know how many different ways I'm supposed to explain this to you. \n\nI'm sorry that what we call \"Commitment/Consistency Bias\" (a compliance psychology tool we use in the financial newsletter advisory business to get people to pay enormous amounts of money for subscriptions) is causing you to double-down on your idea that Motley Fool is somehow different from every other direct marketing publisher of financial advisory products. \n\nBut they're not. They're exactly 100% the same. \n\n>This is the free stuff that is made by copywriters, as well as aspiring analysts who want to get in with the firm/with the industry. They use this to advertise their paid services, which are what generate the firm the majority of their revenue.\n\nStop trying to explain the inner-workings of a company you do not understand to someone who is an expert in this field, highly paid, and one of the biggest money-makers IN THIS ENTIRE FIELD. \n\nThe fact that you think \"SEO\" is still a \"thing\" people use (this isn't 2009) is hilarious. SEO is as dead as dead can get. It's a waste of time and no large operation relies on SEO when, after months of expensive and time-consuming content development and link building, Google can just change their algorithm and drop all your rankings to page 10. \n\nSo these operations rely on PAID DIRECT ADVERTISING. As they did before the Internet with direct mail. And as they have been doing since they moved online. \n\nThey DO NOT BOTHER with SEO.\n\nHere is how Motley Fool and all these companies make money.\n\n**STEP ONE:** They find a \"guru\" for whatever new niche newsletter they want to push out (typically according to whatever is \"hot\" at the time, whether that be pot stocks, options, whatever). \n\n**STEP TWO:** They hire a Direct Response Copywriter to create a front-end promotion (a low-cost front-end offer ranging between $49 to $199 for a year subscription). This copywriter is not an analyst of any kind and has probably never traded in their lives. What this copywriter does, is comb through the past newsletters of the product, find an \"angle\" or a \"gimmick\" (the correct term is a \"Unique Mechanism\" as we use it in this industry) to sell the subscription. \n\n**STEP THREE:** Once the front-end is approve by the Legal department (I.E. they've covered their asses for the outstanding claims being provided). They move onto Paid Advertising (NOT SEO!) through ad networks like Tabloo, Revcontent, and Outbrain. For example, I subscribe to a $400 a month service called WhatRunsWehere.com where I can literally see all the top performing ads Motley Fool is putting out across ad networks and where they are running them (such as Forbes, Breitbart, Yahoo Finance and more). Thus I an see all the new promotions that they're running and how they are performing. I also know for a fact Motley Fool spends up to $10,000...$20,000 a DAY on advertising. \n\n**STEP FOUR:** They now have a list of buyers who are getting these newsletters and stock picks (and yes ADVICE!) every month. BUT the \"guru\" does not write these things. It is ANOTHER team of copywriters in-house who are the Editorial Team (NOT the sales copywriter team and they have NOTHING to do with promotional content). **Understand this: Every single \"special report\", every single monthly newsletter, every single \"alert email\" is written by an in-house editorial team of copywriters. Just like famous businessmen, actors, and politicians aren't actually writing their own books (or even managing their own social media profiles) these analysts are not writing their own content, the editorial team is.**\n\n**STEP FIVE:** Once they've been a member for a little bit, it's time to up-sell them to more expensive \"back end\" products that run in the thousands of dollars a year price range. This is where more Direct Response Copywriters will step in (who, again, have never traded or invested in their lives and are often told internally not to \"drink the kool-aid). \n\n**STEP SIX:** They gain access to yet another newsletter that is NOT written by the \"guru\" but isntead is churned out by the in-house editorial team. \n\nThe process is rinse-and-repeat after that. \n\nSo I don't know what \"SEO\" you're talking about or \"free content\" you're talking about besides the crap on their blog (which doesn't even pull a lot of traffic). \n\nMotley Fool like every single financial advisory publication being direct-marketed since the 1970s is run EXACTLY the same as every other business in this industry -- it is a money-making, profit-building machine.\n\nThe the only incentive is to SELL you! Sell you on big dreams of big gains and security and alleviation of fears.\n\nAnd do you know how much these direct response copywriters make?\n\nWell we (because I'm one of them) can make more money from a SINGLE letter than a New York Times best-selling novelist makes in an entire year of book sales. \n\nJust ONE letter I wrote for an Options Advisory for one of the most trusted, highest-rated, oft-quoted in Barron's, Financial Times and more type of publication...\n\nMade $7 million from mid-November to now. \n\nI get 5% of that on top of the $20,000 I charge to write it. \n\nSo please, do NOT try to lecture me on how Motley Fool or any of these businesses work. You're making yourself look like a fool. \n\nThe incentive is for the copywriters. The incentive is to sell, sell, sell, sell and never stop selling.\n\nAll you are is a subscriber is a name on a list with an applied LCV (Lifetime Customer Value). Nothing more. \n\n>The paid services vary, but the one you're referring to is from staff analysts. They do research in a collaborative setting and pitch their stocks to the Chief Investment Officer and other directors of research. From those, they select a few stocks they will include in the monthly newsletter. These analysts all work on a salary and sign non-compete agreements, they're not freelancers, again, those people write the free content.\n\nAs I have constantly explained, the newsletter content is written by an in-house team of editorial writers. \n\nWhere in the ever loving fuck are you getting the idea (or when did I even SAY) that this content was written by \"freelancers\"?\n\nMy god. \n\n>This is why their portfolio has done reasonably well. You have a lot of people who wanted to get into sell-side research, who were unable to or applied out of cycle and are looking to get experience. It's not a bunch of copywriters.\n\nIt is a bunch of copywriters, and I'll tell you something else too. \n\nThis industry is so incestuous and so \"unoriginal\" (because \"original\" doesn't sell) that all the recommendations you're seeing are just repeated regurgitation from ALL the other financial advisories out there. \n\nThey're all subscribed to each other. \n\nCompeting newsletter companies like -- let's say -- Motley Fool and Oxford Club routinely rent out mailing lists to each other and run promotions to each other's lists. \n\nAnd then, their \"gurus\" collaborate to provide the SAME RECOMMENDATIONS and get a slice of the pie so there's no \"conflict of interest.\"\n\nThis entire industry is fueled by sales copywriting.\n\nThe only thing the \"guru\" does is put their face on it, we copywriters use the guru's reputation to sell their products, and then the editorial teams write the newsletter content, and the short-copy teams write the emails. \n\nPeriod. End of story. \n\n>I'm sure you do your job well, but you are gravely overconfident in your assumptions.\n\nAgain, I do not ASSUME. I am embroiled in this industry and I know it inside, outside, backwards, forwards, up, and down. \n\nYou're an outsider of this industry (likely a paying subscriber) and you're trying to lecture someone who knows leaps and bounds more than you do about the inner workings of the entire direct publishing industry (ESPECIALLY when it comes to the financial publishing industry) and it's ridiculous. \n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 149, "submission_ratio": 0.006711409395973154, "submission_title": "2 months ago I posted a Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendation, $BB(Blackberry) and the post got no love.

Motley Fool is a direct marketing publisher of financial advisory products. They hire people (\"gurus\") to name-brand their various financial ADVISORIES and then issue the regular SEC-required statement that \"This is isn't financial advice, I am not a financial adviser\" blah blah blah. \n\nBut these \"analysits\" are ADVISING paid subscribers on financial decisions. Period. \nAgain, be as pedantic about it as you want, but that is literally what is happening. \n\nI know this industry better than you. I don't know how many different ways I'm supposed to explain this to you. \n\nI'm sorry that what we call \"Commitment/Consistency Bias\" (a compliance psychology tool we use in the financial newsletter advisory business to get people to pay enormous amounts of money for subscriptions) is causing you to double-down on your idea that Motley Fool is somehow different from every other direct marketing publisher of financial advisory products. \n\nBut they're not. They're exactly 100% the same. \n\n>This is the free stuff that is made by copywriters, as well as aspiring analysts who want to get in with the firm/with the industry. They use this to advertise their paid services, which are what generate the firm the majority of their revenue.\n\nStop trying to explain the inner-workings of a company you do not understand to someone who is an expert in this field, highly paid, and one of the biggest money-makers IN THIS ENTIRE FIELD. \n\nThe fact that you think \"SEO\" is still a \"thing\" people use (this isn't 2009) is hilarious. SEO is as dead as dead can get. It's a waste of time and no large operation relies on SEO when, after months of expensive and time-consuming content development and link building, Google can just change their algorithm and drop all your rankings to page 10. \n\nSo these operations rely on PAID DIRECT ADVERTISING. As they did before the Internet with direct mail. And as they have been doing since they moved online. \n\nThey DO NOT BOTHER with SEO.\n\nHere is how Motley Fool and all these companies make money.\n\n**STEP ONE:** They find a \"guru\" for whatever new niche newsletter they want to push out (typically according to whatever is \"hot\" at the time, whether that be pot stocks, options, whatever). \n\n**STEP TWO:** They hire a Direct Response Copywriter to create a front-end promotion (a low-cost front-end offer ranging between $49 to $199 for a year subscription). This copywriter is not an analyst of any kind and has probably never traded in their lives. What this copywriter does, is comb through the past newsletters of the product, find an \"angle\" or a \"gimmick\" (the correct term is a \"Unique Mechanism\" as we use it in this industry) to sell the subscription. \n\n**STEP THREE:** Once the front-end is approve by the Legal department (I.E. they've covered their asses for the outstanding claims being provided). They move onto Paid Advertising (NOT SEO!) through ad networks like Tabloo, Revcontent, and Outbrain. For example, I subscribe to a $400 a month service called WhatRunsWehere.com where I can literally see all the top performing ads Motley Fool is putting out across ad networks and where they are running them (such as Forbes, Breitbart, Yahoo Finance and more). Thus I an see all the new promotions that they're running and how they are performing. I also know for a fact Motley Fool spends up to $10,000...$20,000 a DAY on advertising. \n\n**STEP FOUR:** They now have a list of buyers who are getting these newsletters and stock picks (and yes ADVICE!) every month. BUT the \"guru\" does not write these things. It is ANOTHER team of copywriters in-house who are the Editorial Team (NOT the sales copywriter team and they have NOTHING to do with promotional content). **Understand this: Every single \"special report\", every single monthly newsletter, every single \"alert email\" is written by an in-house editorial team of copywriters. Just like famous businessmen, actors, and politicians aren't actually writing their own books (or even managing their own social media profiles) these analysts are not writing their own content, the editorial team is.**\n\n**STEP FIVE:** Once they've been a member for a little bit, it's time to up-sell them to more expensive \"back end\" products that run in the thousands of dollars a year price range. This is where more Direct Response Copywriters will step in (who, again, have never traded or invested in their lives and are often told internally not to \"drink the kool-aid). \n\n**STEP SIX:** They gain access to yet another newsletter that is NOT written by the \"guru\" but isntead is churned out by the in-house editorial team. \n\nThe process is rinse-and-repeat after that. \n\nSo I don't know what \"SEO\" you're talking about or \"free content\" you're talking about besides the crap on their blog (which doesn't even pull a lot of traffic). \n\nMotley Fool like every single financial advisory publication being direct-marketed since the 1970s is run EXACTLY the same as every other business in this industry -- it is a money-making, profit-building machine.\n\nThe the only incentive is to SELL you! Sell you on big dreams of big gains and security and alleviation of fears.\n\nAnd do you know how much these direct response copywriters make?\n\nWell we (because I'm one of them) can make more money from a SINGLE letter than a New York Times best-selling novelist makes in an entire year of book sales. \n\nJust ONE letter I wrote for an Options Advisory for one of the most trusted, highest-rated, oft-quoted in Barron's, Financial Times and more type of publication...\n\nMade $7 million from mid-November to now. \n\nI get 5% of that on top of the $20,000 I charge to write it. \n\nSo please, do NOT try to lecture me on how Motley Fool or any of these businesses work. You're making yourself look like a fool. \n\nThe incentive is for the copywriters. The incentive is to sell, sell, sell, sell and never stop selling.\n\nAll you are is a subscriber is a name on a list with an applied LCV (Lifetime Customer Value). Nothing more. \n\n>The paid services vary, but the one you're referring to is from staff analysts. They do research in a collaborative setting and pitch their stocks to the Chief Investment Officer and other directors of research. From those, they select a few stocks they will include in the monthly newsletter. These analysts all work on a salary and sign non-compete agreements, they're not freelancers, again, those people write the free content.\n\nAs I have constantly explained, the newsletter content is written by an in-house team of editorial writers. \n\nWhere in the ever loving fuck are you getting the idea (or when did I even SAY) that this content was written by \"freelancers\"?\n\nMy god. \n\n>This is why their portfolio has done reasonably well. You have a lot of people who wanted to get into sell-side research, who were unable to or applied out of cycle and are looking to get experience. It's not a bunch of copywriters.\n\nIt is a bunch of copywriters, and I'll tell you something else too. \n\nThis industry is so incestuous and so \"unoriginal\" (because \"original\" doesn't sell) that all the recommendations you're seeing are just repeated regurgitation from ALL the other financial advisories out there. \n\nThey're all subscribed to each other. \n\nCompeting newsletter companies like -- let's say -- Motley Fool and Oxford Club routinely rent out mailing lists to each other and run promotions to each other's lists. \n\nAnd then, their \"gurus\" collaborate to provide the SAME RECOMMENDATIONS and get a slice of the pie so there's no \"conflict of interest.\"\n\nThis entire industry is fueled by sales copywriting.\n\nThe only thing the \"guru\" does is put their face on it, we copywriters use the guru's reputation to sell their products, and then the editorial teams write the newsletter content, and the short-copy teams write the emails. \n\nPeriod. End of story. \n\n>I'm sure you do your job well, but you are gravely overconfident in your assumptions.\n\nAgain, I do not ASSUME. I am embroiled in this industry and I know it inside, outside, backwards, forwards, up, and down. \n\nYou're an outsider of this industry (likely a paying subscriber) and you're trying to lecture someone who knows leaps and bounds more than you do about the inner workings of the entire direct publishing industry (ESPECIALLY when it comes to the financial publishing industry) and it's ridiculous. \n", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1547385389.0, "submission_id": "9kbs5s", "comment_id": "edz0a5r", "body": ">You have a three very long responses, but again, your lack of actual understanding of the industry beyond the narrow segment you're in is showing.\n\nNo, I do not lack any actual understanding of this industry.
