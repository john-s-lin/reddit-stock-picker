I find the company quite peculiar in that on the one hand they have several business units that are just killing it (Aviation for example)  and on the other hand they have this albatross of GE Capital (GEC) that is suffocating them.  And I don't know what is more strange about GEC, the fact some of those \"assets\" were ever on the books in the first place, or the fact they remain after they \"sold\" said assets.  I recently went long the name so I am a little biased.  I kind of like Flannery.  He has a hard task, but I would guess from this level they pull it off credibly.  I will say I at least trust him.  He acknowledges things are all fouled up around the place and needs changing.  That is a nice break from the past.  Time will tell.  If you apply the multiple Berkshire paid for precision cast parts, I came up with a value for GE Aviation to be about 100B.  Additive manufacturing, Life Sciences, Aviation, Digital, all have some tail winds.  Hopefully they can figure themselves out.  We'll see....

Some think they\u2019re experiencing a long drawn out decline on their deathbed that will eventually end in them going out or being dismantled while others think there is still hope and time for them to turn it around.\n\nThey have recently changed leadership, made some attempts to fix and improve their bookkeeping, tried coming clean with the public about their problems, and supposedly are taking a different approach with business. Will it stick and actually work is the big question. They could be potentially be a very rewarding stock to own if they do turn things around and you are willing to be patient or they could perhaps just as easily continue their slow decline before finally going out or being broken apart.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you see a company as big and established as GE listed at its price. They still have some really great parts of their company but for every one of these parts there are ones that are underperforming or outright failures.\n\nMark my words here. GE will be written about in textbooks decades from now relating to fianc\u00e9, investing, and business.

The company also had a great and explosive run for awhile before it began on a downward trend and had some issues/bad publicity.\n\nThe most important thing here is to remember that stock price is only a price of the puzzle.

If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019d say Apple or Berkshire Hathaway. Both those companies have higher market caps and are worth far more than a company like Chipotle.\n\nMarket cap is basically the sum of all the shares out there being held and traded. These shares combined will give you the current \u201cworth\u201d of a company. Each company can determine how many or little number of shares they have outstanding on the market. Buying shares back or having a smaller number of shares will often lead to a higher listed price. Issuing more shares will often lead to lower listed price because there are now more shares out there.\n\nNot understanding or overestimating the importance of share price can be a deadly mistake, especially for beginners or new investors. It\u2019s how a lot of people fall into penny stocks or buying shitty companies because they appear more affordable. Would you rather own one gold ring or a thousand plastic rings from the nearby carnival?

It\u2019s way you\u2019ll see really successful companies listed for $50 while shitty ones are selling for $200. Market cap is what\u2019s more important and is more or less the current stock prices multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. Market cap will give you a better understanding and figure to go by when determining a company\u2019s worth and value.\n\nTo my knowledge, Chipotle has also not done a share split in a long time (if ever?) so that will often make the shares listed as fairly high. The company also had a great and explosive run for awhile before it began on a downward trend and had some issues/bad publicity.\n\nThe most important thing here is to remember that stock price is only a price of the puzzle. For example, a company like Apple or Berkshire is listed as less than a company like Tesla. Which would you prefer to hold or think is a better overall company?

It\u2019s definitely possible but within the 5-10 years I\u2019d say it will be tough and pretty unlikely for any of the current big banks out there reaching the magic 1 trillion dollar number.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t, however, discourage investing in banks of course. They can certainly grow and perform well and the finance sector can be a very lucrative sector to invest in. There will always be a need for them as people will always need loans, mortgages, places to deposit their checks, pay your bills, accounts to store their savings, and company accounts to keep a business running. I just don\u2019t think there will be as much innovation in a sector as mature as banks and thus less excitement in terms of crazy gains. Solid gains are still absolutely attainable though and many within the sector should continue growing over time.\n\nBanks are also a little more limited with things like regulation and risk factors impacting things as it is often not always their money they\u2019re using or holding as the business model is a constant revolving door of money coming in and out and switching hands. They have to be cautious with spending, R&D, implementing new things, and what not because of the nature of their business. They are also often tied to things that are often out of their control like inflation, market performance, real estate, economy, and laws. This lack of freedom prevents them from trying risky, new things like say a tech company could get away with. Banks certainly have their own money they can tap into that doesn\u2019t belong to customers as well but because of the nature of their business, they have to ensure their particularly careful with how they maneuver themselves.\n\nThe big banks also face competition from not only others within their league but from other financial institutions like credit unions, smaller but growing in popularity online banks, credit card companies, brokers, and payment processors. Thus each move they make has to be cautious with regards to their competition. Even within the banking industry itself, there are different types of banks and a company like JP Morgan will have different goals and practices than a banking company like Bank of America or Wells Fargo.\n\nBig banks won\u2019t be going anywhere and will be here for a long time. They will grow and be solid investments for many. Will they hit 1 trillion one day? Perhaps, but I still think we are fairly far away from that day and when that day comes hitting 1 trillion may not be as big of a feat as it is today (will still be a quite an accomplishment though).", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Do you see big banks becoming $1 Market Cap companies?", "submission_text": "Banks like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America or Citi, do you guys think these banks will ever hit $1 T in Market Cap?\n\nThe reason I ask is I own JPM which has done well for me but it's already $387 B in market cap and I find it difficult to believe it can grow to $1 T in 5-10 years or am I looking at this incorrectly?\n\nUltimately it's based on EPS and multiple but it's just weird to think JPM could be valued that much?", "parent_text": "Do you see big banks becoming $1 Market Cap companies?
