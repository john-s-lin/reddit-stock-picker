This suggests most of the foreign workers in these roles \u201care highly skilled and are filling in for acute labor shortages,\u201d the study said.\n\nOn the flip side, H-1B workers usually earn less than U.S. workers in jobs like data scientist, financial analyst, programmer analyst, and software engineer. For software engineers, for example, the wage difference between American workers and H-1B workers can be as much as 17% depending on the city.\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2017/02/15/h1-b-silicon-valley-wages/\n>The study found that immigration in the computer science sector led to an increase in wages across the broader economy of 0.04% to 0.28%.

What Brad Jacobs has done 3 times (most recently w/XPO Logistics) is pretty amazing.\n\nThere are also roll-ups that have fallen into trouble and if a roll-up turns it can unravel quickly. Valeant is a tremendous example of that. Allergan hasn't fallen apart like Valeant but that's another pharma example of a roll-up that has unraveled in the last 2-3 years.\n\nBroadcom is getting obliterated today because after the attempt to buy Qualcomm was denied by the US govt, Broadcom not long after is going out of its core competency and buying something completely different. People are not only disappointed by the choice of what they are buying, but skeptical of what this means for the strategy broadly. It becomes possibly buying growth for growth sake, but a lot of people simply believe that this pivot by Broadcom to something else is a sign of desperation to maintain its dealmaking momentum.\n\nIt's not good. I think today became way too much of a panic in AVGO and it's off the lows, but I think the company is going to have to really convince people of the strategy here. There are people who have been skeptical of Broadcom for a while, calling it \"the tech Valeant.\" I haven't agreed with that and even after today I think that's dramatic, but I don't like the purchase.

BOC has solid dividends of 5+% per year\n\nif you have access to the japan stock exchange, I really like softbank, the company owns one of japan's major telecoms, a 20% stake in BABA, 20% stake in grab, 20% stake in uber and shares of other tech companies as well. the company is being valued at only their BABA stake, which makes it feel very undervalued. This is widely due to people's fear of Masayoshi's aggressive investing nature. So you are basically getting uber, grab, and the telecom business for free as the entire market cap is already covered by the BABA stake. Don't look at this company from a P/E perspective look at it's asset value. People having difficulty of thinking of this company as not a telecom company but also a fund for tech companies. I expect the stock price to continue to increase even more next year when Uber is expected to IPO.\n\nI also like pipelines, currently have shares of MLPD, a pipeline ETF fund, they give me around 9% dividend annually tax free. distribute it 4x a year. I also like enbridge Inc, (ENB) they've recently gotten approval to build Line 3 which should increase their revenue streams also created a wide moat for themselves with spectra acquisition, their issue of being unable to handle their debt load is significantly less esp with pipeline 3 approval, and they began selling off assets.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) is an interesting stock you might want to look at as well, amazon of spanish speaking countries, they also have created their own version of paypal, which they've integrated into their systems. massive growth potential, risk of course is amazon or venezuela/argentian currency/political/economical crisis. but upside seems better then downside.\n", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 0.75, "submission_title": "Opportunity in US or foreign stocks?

It appears to defy logic \u2014 yet it\u2019s increasingly integrated into our collective lexicon and lifestyle. I think it\u2019s better to view the company as a network and production studio in one (a la Fox, Disney-ABC, NBC, WB, etc).\n\nOne thing that\u2019s understood and (for the most part) agreed upon is that content drives the bus. NFLX has spent a considerable sum amassing it\u2019s own IP and exclusive content. What will happen when the stuff they \u201crent\u201d goes away (Disney in particular)? I want to know how much it\u2019s going to cost them to continually add great content. HBO proved you can function on a small amount of high-quality content. DIS and FOX have a large amount of mediocre material with an occasional smash hit.\n\nSince we are looking at stock price, I think there are growing concerns about the feasibility of NFLX expansion, cost to generate new IP, and share price reaching a saturation point. Are we already at \u201cthe high stock value already bakes in growth and costs\u201d? No. But I think there are hints at NFLX facing difficulties of balancing revenue vs costs to grow further. New subscription plan(s) hint at this. Company debt reveals a bunch. Competition to their current pseudo monopoly pressures the stock.\n\nUltimately, I see the stock continuing to rise through 2018. However, we are another day/month/year closer to Disney abandoning NFLX. Another day where NFLX spent hundreds of millions for a new series or exclusive. 2019 and 2020 will add pressures that probably hinder growth. There\u2019s also the potential for market saturation (far from that at the moment due to account sharing).", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Netflix's stock is topping???", "submission_text": "**Netflix** shares have soared more than 114&#37; this year, but the good times are bound to end soon, one analyst says.\u00a0 \n\n['It\u2019s All Priced in': UBS warns Netflix's stock is topping (NFLX)](http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-stock-price-topping-ubs-warns-2018-7-1027363267)\n\n[Netflix Traders Bet Stock Will Gain 10&#37; After Results](https://www.investopedia.com/news/netflix-traders-bet-stock-will-gain-10-after-results/)\n\n[Netflix (NFLX) earnings preview: 41&#37; revenue growth](https://www.finstead.com/bite/Netflix-NFLX-earnings-preview-july-11-2018)\n\nDo you think Netflix stock is topping? \n\nI think it will do better and I prefer to hold it for a long term.
