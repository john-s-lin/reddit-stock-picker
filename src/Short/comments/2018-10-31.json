Then I round up the comoanies that catch my eye, usually due to recent activity of the company, and compare their financials with each other and stock performance in the past year. If I see the company as healthy and no major hits from shady activities I will settle on a few. \n\nThen it really boils down to management for me. For example I would never invest in a company with a CEO that \"speaks their mind\" on Twitter. Even for a good company, poor management can destroy your investment or set you back on your financial goals. \n\nI choose to invest in companies where the CEO and management make strong and healthy decisions. It may not always seem like a good move but they a playing a few steps ahead of the game. Don't just research financials, research behavior and public relations. Also keep in mind what activities are happening in the world that may effect you investments.\n\nOne last piece of advice, set a goal for how much you want to make with your investment then stick to it.

If your bet was correct, you make money, if wrong, you lose all of it. Examples:\n\n1. You buy a call for $10 at a strike price of $100 for Nov 30th. Each call contains 100 stocks.  This means you pay $1000 for this call. You basically paid $1000 to get the right of buying 100 stocks at end of day Nov 30 at 100 dollars each. So each stock effectively cost you $110.\n\nIf the stock goes up to $120 by end of day Novemebr 30, you would pay $11000 to own stocks that are worth $12000 so you make a $1000 paper profit or real profit if you sell the stocks. The other way to make money is that as underlying stock price goes up, so does the call price. So if the stock goes up to $120 before November 30, the call would be worth around $20. If you sell it before Novemver 30, you make $1000 or 100% profit.\n\nIf stock ends at $108 by end of day Nov 30. The call either expires worthless or you exercise it by paying the remaining $10000 to buy a stock that is worth $11000. This would mean you dont excersise the call and just let it expire worthless because buying the stock would cost you an extra $1000 above the market price.\n\nA put is the opposite. You are betting a stock will go down lower than the strike price. Example:\n\nYou buy a put of $10 (you pay $1000) for a strike price of $90 by Nov 30th. You are betting the stock price will be lower than $90 by the strike date by paying $1000 to buy the right to sell the stock at $90 on Nov 30. If you are right and the stock goes to $80, you make a $1000 by selling for $20 it before the strike date or you buy the stock for $80 and sell it for $90 to the person who issued the put.\n\nThis example was simplified and does not include the time premium of price. What that means is a call is not sold at $10 but will be sold higher based on how long the strike date is and how volatile the stock is. As the time between now and strike date decreases, the premium associated with time increases or decreased based on stock movements. Example, if the price of stock goes up by $10 dollars the next day, your call option will goes up by way more than $10 because it is pricing the likelihood the price will move more. However, as the date approaches, the call price will decrease closer to strike price because you have less time for stock movement.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Can someone please explain to me option calls?

I always thought he was helpful. Basically a call is buying a guaranteed price for a stock that you purchase in hopes that the actual price exceeds your guaranteed strike price at which point you can buy at the strike price and sell at the actual price to make profit. \n\nThe risk is that the strike price remains above the actual price at which point you expense the cost of the option .

Hours of google searches later, still confused", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "An option is a zero sum bet on a particular security. If your bet was correct, you make money, if wrong, you lose all of it. Examples:\n\n1. You buy a call for $10 at a strike price of $100 for Nov 30th. Each call contains 100 stocks.  This means you pay $1000 for this call. You basically paid $1000 to get the right of buying 100 stocks at end of day Nov 30 at 100 dollars each. So each stock effectively cost you $110.\n\nIf the stock goes up to $120 by end of day Novemebr 30, you would pay $11000 to own stocks that are worth $12000 so you make a $1000 paper profit or real profit if you sell the stocks. The other way to make money is that as underlying stock price goes up, so does the call price. So if the stock goes up to $120 before November 30, the call would be worth around $20. If you sell it before Novemver 30, you make $1000 or 100% profit.\n\nIf stock ends at $108 by end of day Nov 30. The call either expires worthless or you exercise it by paying the remaining $10000 to buy a stock that is worth $11000. This would mean you dont excersise the call and just let it expire worthless because buying the stock would cost you an extra $1000 above the market price.\n\nA put is the opposite. You are betting a stock will go down lower than the strike price. Example:\n\nYou buy a put of $10 (you pay $1000) for a strike price of $90 by Nov 30th. You are betting the stock price will be lower than $90 by the strike date by paying $1000 to buy the right to sell the stock at $90 on Nov 30. If you are right and the stock goes to $80, you make a $1000 by selling for $20 it before the strike date or you buy the stock for $80 and sell it for $90 to the person who issued the put.\n\nThis example was simplified and does not include the time premium of price. What that means is a call is not sold at $10 but will be sold higher based on how long the strike date is and how volatile the stock is. As the time between now and strike date decreases, the premium associated with time increases or decreased based on stock movements. Example, if the price of stock goes up by $10 dollars the next day, your call option will goes up by way more than $10 because it is pricing the likelihood the price will move more. However, as the date approaches, the call price will decrease closer to strike price because you have less time for stock movement.", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 0.3333333333333333}, {"time": 1541000645.0, "submission_id": "9szoqi", "comment_id": "e8sl732", "body": "The only thing incorrect about this, is that my one-inch wonder doesn't have any options =/", "score": 5, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Can someone please explain to me option calls?
