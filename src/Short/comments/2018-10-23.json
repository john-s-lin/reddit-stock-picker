Lets say interest rates and inflation were 0%. So one year from now, everything at the store/new business equipment etc. costs the same as it did the year before. In this environment, whether SQ earns $1 this year or next year is irrelevant, because that $1 can buy you the same amount of stuff (i.e. When rates increase, the cost of everything goes up. \n\nSo, in a high interest/inflation rate environment: In 1 year, SQ earns that same $1, but it buys you less stuff. So, investors today are de-valuing the earnings of that $1 more. Since growth stocks like SQ are expected to grow earnings at a higher-than-market rate, even though the expected earnings are increasing, those future earnings are valued less and less as rates increase. Let me know if I need to elaborate more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd SQ makes money off of the number of transactions they provide to their customers.

Lets say interest rates and inflation were 0%. So one year from now, everything at the store/new business equipment etc. costs the same as it did the year before. In this environment, whether SQ earns $1 this year or next year is irrelevant, because that $1 can buy you the same amount of stuff (i.e. When rates increase, the cost of everything goes up. \n\nSo, in a high interest/inflation rate environment: In 1 year, SQ earns that same $1, but it buys you less stuff. So, investors today are de-valuing the earnings of that $1 more.

Either way though who cares when the analysts predict memory pricing to be the weakest - that on its own isn't all that important. Micron would have to lose ~90% of its profits to the trough for this to make any sense. Then you have shit like Netflix which should have to quickly (in a few years time and it ain't happening with all the cash they're burning on original content) enhance its profits by a factor of 10 or more to have its current valuation even begin to make sense.

Moreso that a market that already has larger structural risks (high value baked in in general, headwinds for equities becoming more prominent) and is starting to react with more and more insanity towards a next quarter mindset isn't healthy and is a great environment for a crash to occur.
