Now your stocks are worth $110. 10% profit on you $100 investment, not too shabby for a day\u2019s work!\n\nScenario 2: Option Gain\nYou buy 50 options for $2 each totaling $100 and the share price jumps to $55 right after. Because the option gives you the ability to buy the stock at $50, and the market price of the stock is at $55 the intrinsic value of each option is $5 (ignore time value for now). So you sell your lot of options for $250. Taking into consideration the original $100 you spent to buy them you walk away with $150 in your pocket. A 50% return, significantly more return than investing in the stock. \n\n\nWhy? Because the value of your stock portfolio increases $1 for every $1 your stock investment goes up and you option value also increases roughly $1 for every $1 that your stock goes up (assuming strike price>market price). The key difference is you put up significantly less capital to buy an option than you do to buy a stock so you can buy many more options than you can buy shares. \n\nScenario 3: Stock decline\nYou buy your two shares for $50 each and you wait a week and after little action the stock declines to $49. You lose 2%, leaving you with a portfolio valued at $98.\n\nScenario 4: Options steady\n\nYou buy your 50 options at $2 each with a strike price of $50 and they expire the next week. The stock doesn\u2019t move and at the end of the week it sells at $49. What is the value of your investment?\nWell, why would someone pay you for the option to buy a stock at $50 when they could just buy it in the open market at $49? They wouldn\u2019t... so your portfolio is worth $0.\n\nThings I didnt touch upon for the sake of simplicity: time value - the longer the option has until expiration the more valuable it is.\nVolatility of underlying asset - the more volatile the stock is the more valuable the option.

Now your stocks are worth $110. 10% profit on you $100 investment, not too shabby for a day\u2019s work!\n\nScenario 2: Option Gain\nYou buy 50 options for $2 each totaling $100 and the share price jumps to $55 right after. Because the option gives you the ability to buy the stock at $50, and the market price of the stock is at $55 the intrinsic value of each option is $5 (ignore time value for now). So you sell your lot of options for $250. Taking into consideration the original $100 you spent to buy them you walk away with $150 in your pocket. A 50% return, significantly more return than investing in the stock. \n\n\nWhy? Because the value of your stock portfolio increases $1 for every $1 your stock investment goes up and you option value also increases roughly $1 for every $1 that your stock goes up (assuming strike price>market price). The key difference is you put up significantly less capital to buy an option than you do to buy a stock so you can buy many more options than you can buy shares. \n\nScenario 3: Stock decline\nYou buy your two shares for $50 each and you wait a week and after little action the stock declines to $49. You lose 2%, leaving you with a portfolio valued at $98.\n\nScenario 4: Options steady\n\nYou buy your 50 options at $2 each with a strike price of $50 and they expire the next week. The stock doesn\u2019t move and at the end of the week it sells at $49. What is the value of your investment?\nWell, why would someone pay you for the option to buy a stock at $50 when they could just buy it in the open market at $49? They wouldn\u2019t... so your portfolio is worth $0.\n\nThings I didnt touch upon for the sake of simplicity: time value - the longer the option has until expiration the more valuable it is.\nVolatility of underlying asset - the more volatile the stock is the more valuable the option.

The main distinctions (again, my understanding) of all the AI in the market tend to be:\n\n1) how long does it take for me to train it\n\n2) How is data ingestable (i.e. text, files, streams, voice, images, and so on).\n\nThere are others but these two are the general market ones that most people find important. Here, Watson is ok, not great, not terrible, just ok. It doesnt ingest every possible style, but neither does any other AI last I check, each has their own set of ingestion methods for material for training it.\n\nI think Watson was released about 18 months too early. They could have done a much better hype campaign a few months later and focused on other areas of IBM, but they didn't because Gini was doing poorly as the CEO and wanted to WOW people.\n\nI think the main reason people are not happy with it is that IBM does a ton of work for proof of concepts with the tools they make, like Watson, but you buy it as a blank slate. I always compared it like this: \"You can hire a robot to work very specific tasks and be rigorous in how it works (regular software). OR you can buy a college grad and spend 2 years training them to work exactly as you need them to. But they will produce no value in the 2 years and need significant training.\"\n\nI think Watson is par for the course but was so overhyped that the people that bought into it expected a lot more than from the other platforms.\n\nAnyway, just my two-cents.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 128, "submission_ratio": 0.0078125, "submission_title": "How to invest in AI?", "submission_text": "I already own Amazon, Google, Nvidia.

And again, to even get the hardware to test requires quotes, PO's, approval, etc. Basically, all the corporate red tape makes things take forever.         \n\nLike any sector, in IT There are plenty of brand loyalists who will stick with Intel solely because \"It's what we've always used\". So I think intel will still have plenty of customers for now, but that wave is slowly changing in my opinion. There are definitely cases where intel would make more sense for a few reasons. But for a lot of High scale server deployments, I don't see why you wouldn't want to go with AMD.

RPO represent the estimated value of billed and unbilled subscriptions and services and are seen as an indicator of future revenue.\n\nThe problem for investors is that the CFO, Ms. Gaylor, said this decline in RPO is expected because is it seasonal (and that we should expect lower RPO in Q3 too - with Q4 being the seasonal peak in RPO); however, the CFO botched the answer to the question by an analyst on the call looking to elaborate on the seasonality. Plus, the company didn't disclose comparable RPO figures for the year-ago period - so it hard to tell to what extent the weakness is seasonal versus deterioration in sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Goldman Sachs analyst inquired, \"...you're telling us to expect the normal sequential decline in Q3, but you appear to be coming off a slightly weaker 2Q.\"\n\nThe CFO replied, \"We haven't historically disclosed that number, and it's not in our S-1 on a historical basis, and so, it's just something that we're not disclosing at this time, the past quarters.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is an excerpt of the RPO [prepared commentary from today](https://s22.q4cdn.com/183718357/files/doc_financials/2019/Q2/2Q19-Prepared-Remarks.pdf):\n\n>Now turning to RPO or Remaining Performance Obligations - an indicator of our future revenue streams. RPO provides a comprehensive view and visibility, as it represents the estimated value of our billed and unbilled subscriptions and services, on and off the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $790 million of RPO and we expect approximately 50% of these obligations to be realized in the next twelve months. As a reminder, we expect seasonality in RPO with variability quarter to quarter from a peak in Q4, relative to subsequent quarters.  \n>  \n>In Q1, start dates and prepayments worked in our favor, while in Q2, we did not experience the same level of favorability. Looking ahead to Q3, we expect short term and total deferred revenue to be flat to slightly down compared to Q2, in line with historical seasonality.\n\n&#x200B;", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.14285714285714285}, {"time": 1536790488.0, "submission_id": "9fbvxi", "comment_id": "e5vdi1u", "body": "Considering the price moved over 30%, something obviously wasn\u2019t P R I C E D I N.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 7, "submission_ratio": 0.42857142857142855, "submission_title": "PVTL Dropping After Earnings Beat", "submission_text": "PVTL beat earnings by 33% today and sunk like a rock after-hours.

Our cell phones can \"talk\" to towers through buildings, but that\u2019s partly because they use low-band spectrum, which has a much longer wavelength, allowing for greater distances and less interference.\n\nWith fixed wireless broadband though, it uses millimeter wave spectrum at a \\~55x higher frequency. This means it has much shorter wavelengths that prohibit it from traveling through objects/obstacles. Verizon began 5G testing in Boston, in our view, because it is densely populated (but they could still get the service working only in the South End). Verizon also tested in Sacramento. T-Mobile has said, topologically, Sacramento is considered \u2018a midwestern city\u2019 in the west, meaning the flat terrain results in some success in fixed wireless but, in reality, the offering has limited national viability. We don't have clear reason to believe that the other cities that Verizon is testing in offer materially different/easier topology either.\n\nExperts estimate that the capitalization cost of a cell site at about $75k. With fiber costing $800/home connected to the node, the cell site would have to connect to at least 100 homes to make fixed wireless economical ($75,000/100=$750 for a fixed wireless connection vs. $800 for a fiber (FTTH) passing to the home).\u00a0\n\nSince a millimeter wave tower covers only 2,000 feet with direct line of sight required, there is likely a very small addressable market where 100+ households live in a 2,000 foot radius WITH direct line of sight to the small cell. Also, the cost of this fixed wireless connection roughly equals the cost of FTTH, which is uneconomical.\n\nSo long story short, we're skeptical that fixed wireless home broadband is economically viable and large enough of a market opportunity for Verizon or other players currently, so we believe the risk to fixed broadband players like Comcast and Charter is contained.

Something to continue to monitor though as technology gets better and cheaper.\n\nHope this helps on the 5G question!\n\nIn terms of Titan, we're an SEC-registered investment advisor that purchases and manages securities on retail investors' behalf, in their own individual brokerage accounts that we create for them.

", "parent_text": "Have you done any due diligence at all? Or just jumped in because it is popular? But let me try to make you feel a bit better. Disclosure: I dont own the stock and this info is based on a 5 minute review on Finviz and Morning Star.\n\nP/E is around 4.2. This means their profit per share per year is 25% of the share price. The SP500 P/E is around 17. This basically means that their profits are valued at 25% the average of SP companies. The market is pricing it at this level because they think their revenues and profits will go down. However, if that happens, they would need to lose basically 75% of their profits to meet current valuation.\n\nThis should only worry you if you think the company is going bankrupt because near bankruptcy or a recession is what it would take to drive this down much worse for any meaningful period of time.\n\nNow let's talk about some facts:\n1) revenues are growing and are 60% up in 2017 vs. 2016 and are higher this year. Historically, they go down due to price and demand but last time this went down was by 25%. If this were to repeat, stock would still be worth double what it is now.\n\n2) this is a growing industry due to IA and Internet of Things. So while there will be swings, the long term trajectory is up. Their revenue is double what it was 5 years ago and almost 4 times what it was 10 years ago. To me that is a good long term indicator.\n\n3) The other fundamentals are all very good. They have massive cash flow, return on equity in double digits and high profit margins. This all means the business is very healthy. So even if things go down for a while, the cash flow and depressed price offer a large margin of safety.\n\nAll things considered, unless there is a recession, it is only a matter of time before this goes way up. If you can't hold through this, you are better off selling your stocks and simply buying an index fund like VTI.\n\nI own LRCX and TXN and they are going down and I keep adding.
