The merged AT&T will generate a lot of cash in the short term but there's a reason T is down 25&#37; over the past 18-24 months. For one, AT&T tripled their debt taking on DirecTV and TW and is still paying a huge dividend and doing stock buybacks. Their debt rating is now Baa2.\n\nBut I think the larger consideration is that they merged with businesses that are currently generating piles of cash but have a potentially bleak future. DirecTV and Turner have their foundations built on exclusive sports contracts. DirecTV Now attempts to preserve the cash flow of bundling in a cord-cutting world, but we've already seen what cord-cutting has done to ESPN. It's not pretty. 90&#37; of TW's profits come from Turner and HBO, more than half from Turner. What will that look like without cable TV bundles?

I bought IBM and DAN early thinking I was getting a discount. DAN I even read their sec filings and literally everything checked out, solid financials and healthy future and low debt all the goods. I bought at like 23.5 and it made down to 20, unreal. Good call on SBUX I was doing techincal analysis on them and i think it will fall to the lower support too.
