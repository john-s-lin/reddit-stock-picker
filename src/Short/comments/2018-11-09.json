Everything from Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Heartstone, Destiny, Overwatch, etc. \n\nGranted, I'm not entirely disagreeing with you. \n\nI'm just saying that I'm looking beyond one game, beyond Red Dead Redemption 2. And honestly, I don't feel that Taketwo has nearly the same level of quality of games as Activision. People will buy Activision games, etc.\n\nMy standpoint as a whole is this. Between the three companies, I actually feel all three are a buy. But I'm very familiar with Activision stock. I've watched it go up, sold it, bought it, sold it etc. And I actually feel that Activision anywhere below 60 is a buy.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1542212920.0, "submission_id": "9vmuvh", "comment_id": "e9os917", "body": "I'm so confused by it.

If you have played their older games like Modern Warfare 1 or 2 or Black ops, they were innovative with new game modes, killstreaks, zombies, etc. Also their games were very passionate with characters being stereotypes which made you laugh and had stories you could literally cry to, and YES I did cry to a video game. If you look now, they only recycle the same thing they innovated 10 years ago which will eventually dry out. Other companies used to copy ATVI:s innovation but this year they for example copied Fortnites and PUBG:s Battle royale mode which by luck for them seems to be liked because of the Call Of Duty style of shooting combined with Battle Royale. They even sacrificed the story mode to be able to ride the battle royale hype-train and also focused more on multiplayer microtransactions which let down alot of people including myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso the new Diablo controversy will stay for some time just like Americas worst company (literally) EA-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only thing they really have going for them at the moment is the Esports side which is growing like crazy but my point above is that I think there is a good reason why they are weak when it comes to sales and net bookings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock itself will probably rebound and some analysts will say that it\u00b4s a buy the dip but the path they are going are concerning me.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 518, "submission_ratio": 0.005791505791505791, "submission_title": "RIP Activision Blizzard", "submission_text": "stock is down 14% today and almost 30% in a month.

Kudos to Activision to atleast introducing battle royale to the platform, it's a good start. Back to what I was saying, one of the many goals of gaming companies is to design a game in a way where the user keeps coming back and have them spent as much time as possible in that game like a closed system. Making it a habitat as a part of the user's everyday life even in neurological ways. Trust me the modern game designers and developers are very advanced than we know and are skilled to maximize company revenue at whatever costs. Personally knowing some of the designers within EpicGames they know exactly how to pick out a player from different games and keep em in their platform.

And I, for one, don't even mind they are putting Diablo into mobile.  They are going to make money from it.  And if it gets good feedback on release I might even buy it myself.  \n\nThat said, the gamer in me does wish they were making a real D4.  As many others have said, they fucked up by not even mentioning a D4.  \n\nAll that said, after playing D1 and D2 heavily growing up, I was so mad D3 never put a real pvp system in place for end-game.  Instead the end-game was just pve grinding over and over.  I played the hell out of it, but the entire time I was praying hoping they would add real pvp.  To me, pvp was the essence of Diablo 2.  D3 was just grind, and grind some more in a never ending loop.  The endgame was literally just more ways to grind.  \n\nI loved Diablo enough I still played a lot...but it wasn't the same.  \n\nBethesda is having the same problem.  I will play a ton of FO76 but their attempts to nerf pvp into the ground have me worried.  PvP is really the only end-game that can capture my attention for months or even years of playing the same game.  I am hopeful pvp servers will eventually release or I don't know how long I'll play FO76 before just getting bored.  I know pvp tends to attract the more hardcore players, and companies are thirsty for casual players and their wallets (once you become a parent or adult, you usually have to become a casual player due to time constraints).  For the same reasons casual players are lucrative - they usually have jobs and families and so spending on MTX to save time grinding usually isn't a big deal.  \n\nSo, as others have said, Blizzard getting into mobile is a no-brainer from a business perspective.  But the constant dumbing-down of their games means they are sacrificing the goodwill of hardcore gamers to do it.  \n\nOld Blizzard probably wouldn't have made mobile Diablo.  But ever since their merger with Activision the decisions have been focused on what makes them money - not what would make the fans happy.  \n\nSo in that regard Blizzard sold out loooooong ago, and this is simply the next symptom.\n\nTHe good news for hardcore gamers though is that we have never had so much choice in what and how to play.  Most of us have Steam libraries full of untouched or barely-touched games.  \n\nSo, I can wait, play my backlog, and be picky about what new games I buy.  So aside from Steam sales there are only 2 games I've bought this year:  Kingdom Come and FO76.  Ever other game I've been patient about, waiting sometimes years for the DLC to come out and buy a 75% off GOTY edition fully patched all DLC included.  /r/patientgamers has helped me make much fewer regretable purchases.  I only buy something I KNOW I'm going to like at launch. \n\nBlizzard games used to be must-have Day 1 purchases.  But ever since Activision got involved the only remaining studio that has Day 1 must-buy status is Bethesda.  I've bought every game of theirs since I was a college student, other than ESO because after DAOC no other MMO has interested me, not even WoW.  \n\nANyways time for me to stop rambling\n\nTLDR:  Blizzard was doomed when Activision bought them and this is simply more proof.  They are no longer an elite studio in my mind due their ruthless pursuit of $$$.  Bethesda is the only big studio left that I give any semblance of trust.  And even they are making a Skyrim-style mobile game in Blades.  But at least they promised FO76 MTX's would be cosmetic only, which I'm fine with in exchange for them putting a full studio on just making free DLC and improving the game's content post-release.  \n\nBut Blizzard?  The last game of theirs I enjoyed and really got into was the First/Terran release of Starcraft 2.  For me personally its been all downhill for Blizzard since.  \n\nI mean, look at Hearthstone.  Its basically just Magic online.  But there are multiple xpacks per year and if you want to stay competitive you HAVE to buy them, and if you DON'T buy them soon enough after release you never get an opportunity to do so because Blizzard makes old xpacks unavailable - the sole goal of this being to FORCE you to buy the xpacks.  Its totally greedy and shameful but those types of practices are why I'm just not a Blizzard fan anymore.  They make high quality and polished games, and then go after your wallet ruthlessly.  AH in D3, limited time buy xpacks in Hearthstone.  They just want more and more $$$ and they expect you to pay full price for it because - hey - its Blizzard!!\n\nBut to me the true Blizzard is gone.  They are just another developer trying to cater to the masses.  \n\n(Am I mad about no pvp in D3 still?  Hell yes.  Please don't fuck me with FO76 Bethesda, you are my only remaining hope in the AAA sector of gaming.)\n\nTLDR take 2:  Blizzard is greedy and their emphasis on profit instead of pleasing their biggest fans makes them, in my mind, a tier-2 studio.  Diablo mobile is just another financially smart foreseeable step in the wrong direction.

I'm not saying that they can't go after other markets. I also didn't say that they weren't making a new game. Did you watch the announcement? Do you play Diablo? \n\nThe announcement of DI would have been much less insulting (personally, as a loyal player), if they had pretty much changed their announcement in any way. For example, announce DI then tease anything regarding a D2-remastered or D4. This is what Bethesda did for ES6 (announce a mobile game then tease the new PC game coming down the pipe). The people who attend Blizzcon (in person or via a Virtual Ticket) are their most hardcore and loyal fans, who, until March 2014 (Hearthstone release date), ***were all PC-gamers exclusively***. \n\nImagine you are a hardcore Tesla fan. You drive a Model S. You own a Tesla Powerwall. You buy a ticket to Tesla-con and you hear that Elon is going to announce the next big Tesla product on the opening day. He comes out on stage and announces...Tesla Velcro, a Tesla brand of shoe. \n\n\"*Everyone wears shoes, right?*\", Elon exclaims to boos from the audience. \n\nNot a new car, not a new piece of environmental technology for homes or businesses. Tesla is now expanding into the shoe market. :) Is it an intelligent business move? Maybe...probably. Does Tesla have the right to do that? Absolutely. Does it feel good to loyal customers? Probably not.\n\nBlizzcon is meant to be a celebration of Blizzard games and way to get together as a community and rally around the games that have brought people together over the past 2 decades. It's also meant as a way for Blizzard to showcase to fans why they should continue to stay loyal customers. It really felt to Diablo fans (and even fans and exclusive players of other games) that Blizzard was wrong to announce DI in such a way to such a group of people. \n\nTLDR; Personal context is what makes it a slap in the face.

For example, announce DI then tease anything regarding a D2-remastered or D4. This is what Bethesda did for ES6 (announce a mobile game then tease the new PC game coming down the pipe). The people who attend Blizzcon (in person or via a Virtual Ticket) are their most hardcore and loyal fans, who, until March 2014 (Hearthstone release date), ***were all PC-gamers exclusively***. \n\nImagine you are a hardcore Tesla fan. You drive a Model S. You own a Tesla Powerwall. You buy a ticket to Tesla-con and you hear that Elon is going to announce the next big Tesla product on the opening day. He comes out on stage and announces...Tesla Velcro, a Tesla brand of shoe. \n\n\"*Everyone wears shoes, right?*\", Elon exclaims to boos from the audience. \n\nNot a new car, not a new piece of environmental technology for homes or businesses. Tesla is now expanding into the shoe market. :) Is it an intelligent business move? Maybe...probably. Does Tesla have the right to do that? Absolutely. Does it feel good to loyal customers? Probably not.\n\nBlizzcon is meant to be a celebration of Blizzard games and way to get together as a community and rally around the games that have brought people together over the past 2 decades. It's also meant as a way for Blizzard to showcase to fans why they should continue to stay loyal customers. It really felt to Diablo fans (and even fans and exclusive players of other games) that Blizzard was wrong to announce DI in such a way to such a group of people. \n\nTLDR; Personal context is what makes it a slap in the face.

It's gone down from $4.50 to $0.015 right now which is a clear sign of death but who knows. Definitely worth the gamble in my opinion. \n\nThat being said, indeed, De Beers actually have their own lab grown company called Element Six which doesnt create diamonds as jewelry but for manufacturing purposes. Personally, my favorite lab grown diamond company, and perhaps the most promising, is a privately held company named Diamond Foundry. It's raised over $100 Million already from Twitter, Google, Facebook, Ebay executives along with none other than Leo DiCaprio. Found it odd that Leo had invested in them until I connected the dots: Leo is known nature protector and having played in Blood Diamonds the movie, he must have been informed and disgusted by this industry and investing in Diamond Foundry is his way of saying fuck you to De Beers all while making bank. \n\nWill wait to see if it IPOs.
