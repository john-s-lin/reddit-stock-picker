Over the last two years the area has had numerous fires and a number are linked to downed PG&E lines.\n\nTheir lack of maintenence killed eight people back in 2010. They knew their gas lines were failing and didn't replace them quickly and the resulting explosion killed people. It's happened before. They've been unsafe for years and it's catching up. I can't watch TV without ads about how they're focused on safety and the culture of safety or how they're helping the community. Everyone around here knows their reputation is trash because every news story with them is another failure causing property damage or people getting hurt or killed.\n\nThey've had this coming for years. They do not maintain enough cleared space and the agencies meant to inspect them have failed as well.\n\nIf they go under after starting one of the worst wildfires in history they'll have made their own bed.

Haven\u2019t done a ton of research on them particularly and as silly as it sounds I hate them from a ex-customer standpoint so never really looked too deep in them. They just sort of seem to exist and struggle with innovating. I know banks aren\u2019t exactly renowned for being innovative but BAC just seems stuck from where they were 5-7 years ago whereas banks like JPM and Ally have made solid attempts at bringing something new to the table. Not a bad company, just not sure you\u2019ll be outperforming a simple index fund with a company like BAC.\n\nAs for banks or just financials in general that I like, I always liked Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan and think they\u2019re valued decently right now. \n\nGoldman Sachs has taken a pretty nasty beating over the past six months. I\u2019m not as confident in them in the short term but think an argument can be made that they\u2019re near their bottom. Morgan Stanley is in a similar boat as well. These two aren\u2019t going anywhere but I worry how they would fare during a recession or economic slowdown as a lot of their business involves investment banking.\n\nI hold Wells Fargo but I got in a few years ago with them and haven\u2019t really looked things over in quite some time. TBH it\u2019s just a small position I\u2019ve held for awhile and just sort of let be. Hoping they can actually turn things around from a business and culture point and have a scandal free, solid decade in the 2020s. I don\u2019t intend on adding to my position with them and wouldn\u2019t really recommend them. They have a lot of work to do and the scandals, despite damaging their reputation, didn\u2019t exactly kill their stock and put them at bargain prices.\n\nI think Deutsche Bank could be a real wildcard. They\u2019re in really tough shape right now and things look pretty grim but they\u2019re also one of the largest banks in the world, and especially in Europe. It could be a risky play that pays off very well. I can\u2019t see them collapsing or being allowed to fall too hard simply because of their size, influence, and connections to so much of Europe.\n\nAs mentioned, I also own shares of Visa and Square as well. I know they\u2019re not banks but figured I\u2019d mention them as they\u2019re within the financial sector. Love Visa and it\u2019s actually my biggest single stock holding. Square I got really lucky with and purchased shares a little under 2 years ago. Sold some of my position in September but still hold a few thousand dollars in them. I think both companies have pretty bright futures but not sure if they\u2019re exactly bargains or fairly valued right now.\n\nBanks are really tricky to evaluate and the metrics used to value them are a little different than stocks in other sectors. Based on the current climate, I\u2019d be cautious of any bank that relies heavily on investing or broker services. Banks relying heavily on mortgages and real estate may be at risk too. I think the ones likely to succeed over the next few years are the ones valued modestly that are diversified enough in their business models and can remain innovative in a fairly stagnate sector. I also think insurance has solid potential.
