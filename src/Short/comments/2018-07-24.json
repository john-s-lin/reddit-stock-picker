The reason Amazon gets such a high valuation along with other high growth names is that we are seeing disruption take place at a higher pace than at any time in history. If the upside risk to a company is that much higher, the willingness of investors to buy at higher valuations should be there as well. \n\nThe same thing goes for the downside. Like never before companies are being disrupted really quickly, and can go from solid fundamentals to terrible lightning quick. If you are in the line of sight of Amazon or another disruptor large or small, you probably deserve a lower multiple because your downside risk is that much greater. \n\nThis is only going to get more exacerbated as time goes on. Companies can grow and crash within very short timeframes now because disruption is speeding up.

I hold no grudge or anything against you in particular, you seem pretty cool.\n\nWhat do your customers think about your decision to build a tool to financial firms or individual traders if you presumably had access to capital to take advantage of those inefficiencies identified by your tools yourself? (If there is truly alpha, wouldn't coming from the money management side have allowed you to capture it directly? Isn't that the most efficient thing to do with sources of alpha that actually work? Now, I fully agree that selling models that kind of work generates a much more certain stream of earnings.)\n\n\nAssuming there is alpha, have you thought about at what point your tool has too many customers for the data to no longer be worth anything because it is already priced in?\n\n\nDoes your tool really provide more estimates than Bloomberg, which aggregates the predictions for earnings & for economic fundamentals? Or is it the biggest platform that tries to create an estimate that beats the median prediction?

The reason Amazon gets such a high valuation along with other high growth names is that we are seeing disruption take place at a higher pace than at any time in history. If the upside risk to a company is that much higher, the willingness of investors to buy at higher valuations should be there as well. \n\nThe same thing goes for the downside. Like never before companies are being disrupted really quickly, and can go from solid fundamentals to terrible lightning quick. If you are in the line of sight of Amazon or another disruptor large or small, you probably deserve a lower multiple because your downside risk is that much greater. \n\nThis is only going to get more exacerbated as time goes on. Companies can grow and crash within very short timeframes now because disruption is speeding up. The hot new tech today may be made obsolete in 10 years, so rationally you should give the company a high growth multiple on the way up and then once the growth is gone you should crush the multiple.

It's pretty difficult to effectively arb a data set. It takes a lot of different skill sets that data companies do not have. Running money is not easy, and the structure of the cap table of data companies is not designed to make money from trading. Also, the multiple at sale on revenue from trading is much lower than subscription data sales. \n\nBut more than that, it can actually be more profitable to sell the data (even if it generates a lot of alpha) than to trade it yourself. At Estimize we pride ourselves in selling something that (if used correctly) actually helps firms do this.

It can generate alpha, but for most firms it won't and doesn't. That doesn't mean there's an adverse selection issue going on, it's just that finance is an inefficient industry filled with people who mostly don't succeed.

And I think the questions isn't actually being asked in the right way (not to malign your question, I just don't think it's the right question). \n\nAll data sets will get arbed, period. Some have higher capacity than others, and will take longer. Sell side analyst estimates have been around 30+ years and there's still alpha. \n\nThe adverse selection issue you point to is not actually a problem. It's pretty difficult to effectively arb a data set. It takes a lot of different skill sets that data companies do not have. Running money is not easy, and the structure of the cap table of data companies is not designed to make money from trading. Also, the multiple at sale on revenue from trading is much lower than subscription data sales. \n\nBut more than that, it can actually be more profitable to sell the data (even if it generates a lot of alpha) than to trade it yourself. At Estimize we pride ourselves in selling something that (if used correctly) actually helps firms do this. But there are a lot of products out there that are sold which people buy because they think they need it, not because it directly generates alpha. I put credit card receipt data in this bucket. It can generate alpha, but for most firms it won't and doesn't. That doesn't mean there's an adverse selection issue going on, it's just that finance is an inefficient industry filled with people who mostly don't succeed. That's just a fact. \n\nAlso, data doesn't have to be sold to generate alpha on a stand alone basis. Most of data that's sold is used by analysts to inform their overall opinion about something, such as their own future differentiated view.

Believe it or not, the average tick size per Food Delivery is something like 60 - 100% higher than if you were to go to the restaurant and eat the food. Needless to say, there is HUGE opportunity for food delivery.\n\n\n$GRUB does a great job because they offer SaaS POS systems for restaurants who are interested. It's a great POS platform and really helps migrate mom-and-pa restaurants to the modern age, while also being placed on a platform that generates incremental orders and exposure for the restaurants.\n\n\nAll that being said, I think $GRUB is just too expensive right now, and it hasn't survived a recession just yet. I'm not trying to time a market entry as much as I am trying to better understand what happens to a company like $GRUB when people have less disposable income (maybe they're 1 in the same lol).

I was there for 2-years and understood the business model very well, especially the marketing and operational components.\n\nAfter $GRUB bought 2 significant companies in August 2017 for an immaterial amount, I bought $GRUB @ like $55 a share. I knew this was a great move for $GRUB and I think they're the biggest name in the space (UberEats being the \"Target\", whereas GrubHub is the \"Walmart\"; UberEats entered the game late, but has better scale than a lot of the others in the space).\n\n\nI sold my $GRUB when it hit ~$100 because it became somewhat of a meme and I knew it was wildly over-priced, and I still think that it is. Why? People forget just how good the U.S. economy is right now and how much disposable income middle-class Americans have. Believe it or not, the average tick size per Food Delivery is something like 60 - 100% higher than if you were to go to the restaurant and eat the food. Needless to say, there is HUGE opportunity for food delivery.\n\n\n$GRUB does a great job because they offer SaaS POS systems for restaurants who are interested. It's a great POS platform and really helps migrate mom-and-pa restaurants to the modern age, while also being placed on a platform that generates incremental orders and exposure for the restaurants.\n\n\nAll that being said, I think $GRUB is just too expensive right now, and it hasn't survived a recession just yet. I'm not trying to time a market entry as much as I am trying to better understand what happens to a company like $GRUB when people have less disposable income (maybe they're 1 in the same lol). The profit margin % on their SaaS revenue is what makes $GRUB so lucrative, but order volume will likely go down when people are less inclined to spend.

That's probably still a bit of a while off, but I guess one has to question how the company will repeat the growth path of the last decade again - how much more of a runway does the company really have? Dominos did delivery better than anyone else, especially given the scale. Now with UberEats, Grubhub and others, delivery is much more commonplace and any restaurant really can now have that capacity.\n\nSo again, I'm not saying it's a bad company, not saying it's over but I don't know how the company repeats the last 10 years (or even the last 5, really) and short-term the stock got ahead of itself.
