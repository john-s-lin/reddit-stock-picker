In other words, coke producers have been able to increase their margins by paying for less metal in their cans.

Not only that but they will abandon Instagram and WhatsApp as well. Moreover government regulations will kick in and it will make the situation even worse. Given this, advertisers will abandon FB and FB earnings will fall precipitously.\n\nLet\u2019s call this scenario 1. If this is how things turn out, FB is overvalued right now and should fall even further. Best to sell the stock if this is what you believe is likely to happen.\n\nNow let imagine Scenario 2, where the exact opposite happens. Not only does people not leave Facebook, but they use all of FB\u2019s social networks even more. The regulations don\u2019t come and the costs for FB don\u2019t increase. In this case, earnings and revenue will continue to grow and FB is undervalued quiet a lot. Buy as many shares as you can.\n\nI for one don\u2019t believe in either of these 2 scenarios. I think that the third option, a middle way between these two is the most likely. Facebooks user growth is going to stagnate, or even decline slightly. But Instagram will continue to grow and Facebook might figure out something to do with WhatsApp. The costs for FB are going to increase, not just because of regulations but because users want a better social media environment which will cost FB. However, there will continue to be growth in revenue in the 10% ish range. While margins will be pressured, revenue growth combined with declining margins will lead to flatline earnings or maybe even moderate growth in earnings. If this is the case, FB is fairly valued at these price ranges. I bought FB because it offered a great company at fairly reasonable price.\n\nNow, how do we tell which of these scenarios is actually happening. Certainly not from commentary or anecdotes. Every 3 months, Facebook releases its earnings report. We can check them to see which scenario is playing out.\n\nIf within a year, the revenue growth has stalled, the costs have increased, users have left Facebook, by significant percentages, FB will go down in price and I will get out of the stock at a loss.\n\nHowever, if it is scenario 2 and 3 which turn out to be true, I will continue to hold onto the stock and maybe even buy more.\n\nYou have to assess the likelihood of these things happening, the risk of you being wrong and whether there is appropriate compensation for the risk you bear.

Right now is a hard time for investing in general since the market is choppy and uncertain. If oil dips into the low 40s that would be a relatively safe investment.

And no, don\u2019t worry about California construction companies, business won\u2019t increase that much to affect stocks.        \n\nAs far as stocks that could balloon in 5 months, weed stocks. It\u2019s somewhat of a meme, but it\u2019s true. That\u2019s your best bet for a company that could balloon a lot. ACB, APHA, Acreage Holding (list tomorrow on the stock market) are who I would suggest, but their are plenty of others.       \n\nWhat I suggest, would be to spend most of the money on big stocks that\u2019s are at a low level currently, CAT for example. CAT (a construction machinery company) is near a 52 week low and could see a pretty big uptick in 5 months if the trade war with China doesn\u2019t actually happen.    \n\nAfter spending a good bit in companies such as that, I would place some in weed stocks, say 100-150Kish. It could completely crash your value, but it could also balloon incredibly and let you win.     \n\nSome I would suggest would to invest in or check out would be CAT, AT&T, Verizon, AMD, Waste Management, Visa, Microsoft, Abbvie. That gives you good potential to grow a little and NOT lose much base value.    \n\n\nAnd for a big growth weed stock I would suggest one or two of Aurora Cannabis, Aphria, and Acreage Holdings.

Once you do sell and realize a gain, you will have to pay taxes on it. One thing to remember is you also have to remember that dividends are also taxed regardless if you sell your shares.\n\nDividends are taxed, regardless if you collect them or reinvest them or whether you sell a stock. They are due in the calendar year you\u2019re paid them and technically the quarter you\u2019re paid them in. If it\u2019s a few hundred bucks, you\u2019re probably ok waiting until the end of the year to pay them. Your tax return/credit might cover what you owe in taxes for your dividends as well but I always recommend erring on the side of caution and making sure you pay to avoid penalties/late fees. Once you start collecting thousands of dollars in dividends, it might be a good idea to make estimated tax payments throughout the year or speak with an accountant/tax advisor to figure out a plan.\n\nYou are allowed to claim losses and use them to your advantage if you actually sell your shares at a loss. There are limits/rules on how much you can claim as a loss per calendar year and losses can carry over to following years. US tax laws are fairly complex and it\u2019s difficult to explain when there are so many different scenarios here so again, do your research or speak with a professional.\n\nThe IRS couldn\u2019t care less what your account balances are or how your stocks performed until you actually realize (sell) a gain or loss. If your shares in company are up 500% but you haven\u2019t sold, it doesn\u2019t matter and you don\u2019t have to do anything tax wise. Alternatively, if your portfolio is crashing hard but you haven\u2019t sold anything, it doesn\u2019t matter to them and you can\u2019t claim any losses unless you actually sold and realized the loss. If you\u2019re more or less buying and holding for the long run, dividends are probably your biggest concern in regards to taxes.\n\nCouple examples:\n\n1) At start of the year you buy $10,000 in a company stock and now have $10,000 in your portfolio in a stock that pays 2% in dividends for the year. At the end of the year your portfolio is $15,000 but you haven\u2019t sold anything. In this scenario, you owe no taxes besides the taxes on your dividends because you haven\u2019t realized any gains outside of the dividends. Again, it doesn\u2019t matter how well or bad your portfolio performed in the eyes of the IRS until you actually begin realizing gains/losses.\n\n2) You start the year at $10,000 with the same stock as example 1, once again collecting a 2% dividend, However, in November of that year your portfolio has hit $15,000 and you decide you\u2019ve had enough and cash out your whole portfolio. You would owe taxes on $5,000 in capital gains along with the taxes on any dividends that were paid out. You do not pay taxes on the original money you used to buy the shares of the stock earlier on. This is called your cost basis and it\u2019s important to understand how cost basis works.\n\n3) Now let\u2019s say you have $10,000 in a portfolio consisting of 5 stocks you brought at the beginning of the year with equal weight in each company (2k). Stocks A & B grow 10% while stocks C, D, & E fall 10%. You decide to sell stocks A & B (your winners) in full along with Stock C (a loser) in full. You decide to continue holding Stocks D & E and do nothing with them. Your capital gains for the year are $200 because you have $400 in winners (Stocks A & B at $200 each for a $400 total gain) and one loser (Stock C at a $200 loss). You would owe taxes on that $200 gain because you realized it by selling your shares. Again, you\u2019d also owe taxes on any dividends paid out in the year. Even if stocks D & E lost value, these don\u2019t influence your taxes because no gains or losses were realized for those shares. The same could be said if stocks D & E performed well and grew.\n\nMake sure you understand the difference between long term and short term capital gains. Also, understand what qualified and non qualified dividends are. Understand how cost basis works. Those terms are probably the most important in terms of figuring out how taxes work with investing.\n\nAdditionally, make use of any tax advantaged accounts you have available to reduce/eliminate your taxes.

I understand they have a huge cash flow, lots of cash on hand, first company to hit 1 trillion. Whatever. I think apple is going to start crashing in a hard way because of public perception. Apple is slowly transitioning from a products based model, to a service based model. Why are they doing this? Well now that phones cost more than a computer people are holding onto their phones longer (average of about 8 months). Along with this people are starting to notice that apple does not actually support their products at a reasonable price. Apple is constantly trying to sue 3rd party sources from repairing their devices because it is cutting into their profit.

Valuation coming down is normal. Growth may be present, just at above-the-market rates of return. As a dad, I have found no better UI, programming and lineup of shows. \n\nMy concept for TV has always been what NETFLIX is and can be, and that is content distribution studios won't do or commit to, with the exception of MAYBE HBO. I'm thinking Blizzard game spin-offs, book spin-offs (Dark Tower series), and really anything with a huge fan-following, needs a long runway of time to play out, using small to medium budget and really any actors not big-name. \n\nI look at the warchest of content a company like Activision/Blizzard has and if ATVI doesn't go it on their own, then a platform like Netflix would be awesome! Only HBO has come close and other big powerhouses are closing in, but the big networks cannot touch it and are dying off. \n\nMy son and I love the kids shows on NFLX, I can watch it anywhere, there's a ton of shows that are non-Disney, non-Nick, easily located, recommended quickly and a show like Dinotrux spun off into DinoTrux Supercharged. Before that, it was seasonal content, like Halloween and Christmas. Mind you, maybe some of that is big-name network like Disney that will be lost once it is official, however, this can be the future of Netflix, on top of the rights of other companies and more importantly...being Global, something really only DISNEY and maybe HBO have done (to my knowledge). \n\nAs it goes for adult programming, I'm always torn between live sports, HBO, Amazon Prime, etc. I don't find those platforms have a 'sexy' UI that makes it easy to login, get a show and even locate a new show for me. More often, I'm just played out on the whole thing. I do find Prime and HBO's football content great (Hard Knocks, All or Nothing, Ballers) to be enjoyable. For me, it's about core shows then spin-offs. There's too much to watch, so jumping from Streaming service to Streaming service simply for Seinfield, the Office or whatever, isn't worth it. HBO will cash in if they do Game of Throne spinoffs now, keep Westworld rolling, etc. AMC has a potential in American Gods, too. Prime having Thursday night football is awesome, because the graphics are great, they do a wonderful job on delivery and I can go up to my 2 monitor computer at night, work, and keep the game on if I want during the week. That's the benefit to streaming IMO, or put it on a notebook, etc. \n\nThe rest, imo, is filler. I don't get excited about that kind of stuff, so these providers really need some kind of flag pole or main stake franchise or a few to wrap around, then branch-off. As a 38 yo, I wish I had just plunked down some dough on NFLX way back when seeing what they become. Growth is always there when no on expects it because the market then OVER-REACTS to the story it missed and gives it the valuation it has long since deserved.

", "parent_text": "Company and content are great, but the stock is ahead of itself, imo. Valuation coming down is normal. Growth may be present, just at above-the-market rates of return. As a dad, I have found no better UI, programming and lineup of shows. \n\nMy concept for TV has always been what NETFLIX is and can be, and that is content distribution studios won't do or commit to, with the exception of MAYBE HBO. I'm thinking Blizzard game spin-offs, book spin-offs (Dark Tower series), and really anything with a huge fan-following, needs a long runway of time to play out, using small to medium budget and really any actors not big-name. \n\nI look at the warchest of content a company like Activision/Blizzard has and if ATVI doesn't go it on their own, then a platform like Netflix would be awesome! Only HBO has come close and other big powerhouses are closing in, but the big networks cannot touch it and are dying off. \n\nMy son and I love the kids shows on NFLX, I can watch it anywhere, there's a ton of shows that are non-Disney, non-Nick, easily located, recommended quickly and a show like Dinotrux spun off into DinoTrux Supercharged. Before that, it was seasonal content, like Halloween and Christmas. Mind you, maybe some of that is big-name network like Disney that will be lost once it is official, however, this can be the future of Netflix, on top of the rights of other companies and more importantly...being Global, something really only DISNEY and maybe HBO have done (to my knowledge). \n\nAs it goes for adult programming, I'm always torn between live sports, HBO, Amazon Prime, etc. I don't find those platforms have a 'sexy' UI that makes it easy to login, get a show and even locate a new show for me. More often, I'm just played out on the whole thing. I do find Prime and HBO's football content great (Hard Knocks, All or Nothing, Ballers) to be enjoyable. For me, it's about core shows then spin-offs. There's too much to watch, so jumping from Streaming service to Streaming service simply for Seinfield, the Office or whatever, isn't worth it. HBO will cash in if they do Game of Throne spinoffs now, keep Westworld rolling, etc. AMC has a potential in American Gods, too. Prime having Thursday night football is awesome, because the graphics are great, they do a wonderful job on delivery and I can go up to my 2 monitor computer at night, work, and keep the game on if I want during the week. That's the benefit to streaming IMO, or put it on a notebook, etc. \n\nThe rest, imo, is filler. I don't get excited about that kind of stuff, so these providers really need some kind of flag pole or main stake franchise or a few to wrap around, then branch-off. As a 38 yo, I wish I had just plunked down some dough on NFLX way back when seeing what they become.
