I suggest a neutral book about how stocks and the market works and not one that tells you how to make a lot of money.  :)  This is very interesting stuff and not terribly complicated!\n\nNext consider getting a paper trading account from a broker like the Think or Swim platform.  Start paper trading which has no risk, but you will start learning the basics and be able to apply your knowledge from what you've read.\n\nTo choose stocks learn about fundamental and technical analysis, which will help a lot.\n\nExpect it to take some time, but if it fascinates you like it does me, it will come quickly.

On the flip side total bonds is folly as well (inflation can kill that).  A reasonable baseline is the conservative VBINX fund which is a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds.  The intelligent portfolio dis way better than that.  So at first I was disappointed until I realized it performed closer to the SPY than the VBINX.

Let me tell u why, fear and greed are the two most difficult things to master. Lets say you set aside 30% cash for the crash for 2018, and the market rises in November to record highs. Aha you say, this is the bull rally on its last legs, and you wait... and wait ... and in 2019 the market is bullish and everyone around you is making monies that you chose to set aside. In 2019 June you finally capitulate and decide to go all in. Then the market corrects but you are out of cash. \n\nI have a list of stocks I want to buy when the market corrects. And I am also sitting on cash and i watch everybody make out like bandits while I am sucking my thumb.....\n\n\nCheers!", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "30-40% correction is coming during this year or next?
