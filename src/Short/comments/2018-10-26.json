Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS.

Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down.

They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.\n\nThe good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones.

The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful\n2. Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS.
