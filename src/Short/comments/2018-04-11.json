Yes, my general strat is to short leveraged ETFs. The idea is that over the longer term, the rebalancing cost from the structure of the products themselves is a drag on overall returns and in many cases pulls them negative. (ex: look at 1 year chart on crude. ~51.44 - ~70.67. That's a ~37% rise, right? Now look at UWT and DWT. In a world w/o rebalancing costs we'd expect them to have 3x the movement of the underlying. In reality, UWT was $18.53 to 38.33 and gained only 106% (so, a 5% drag from rebalancing costs, minus any gains from oil being in contango during that period). DWT was $25.54 to $7.48. That's a loss of ~70%.\nNatural gas is even more fun. 3.234 to 2.904 in a year. Loss of ~10%. Yet UGAZ went from 187.2 to 68.37 (-63% on something that should only be -30% sans rebalancing costs).  DGAZ went from 20.34 - 22.33 (gain of 9.7% on something that should be over 30% sans rebalancing costs). So the drag from rebalancing costs in 1 year alone was 33% on DGAZ and ~20% on UGAZ.\n\nShorting leveraged funds is easier than longing the inverse. Your timing doesn't have to be as exact when shorting. You can ride out any price bumps. Thing is - if it continues in the same direction you're screwed (ex: LABU short). Natural Gas (DGAZ/UGAZ) are great as natty generally trades within a range or falls back to the mean over time. So drawdowns aren't too bad. Just size correctly.

I picked a store I liked to shop at but accidentally tracked a row up or down on the archaic small newspaper print so \u201cinvested in\u201da random acronym. It\u2019s stock soared and I came out on top! Realized my error, had no explanation or idea what the company was.\n\nAs a teacher (I am) I know units of learning have a limited time period so I\u2019d talk to class about long term v short term, show some evidence and try to include tracking past performance into the assignment to illustrate the big picture. It\u2019s cool you get to learn about finance though.\n\nIf I were you I would google a little then pick solid top performer(s) in your sector. These are the sectors:\n\nFinancial, industrials, technology, telecom, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, utilities, healthcare, materials and real estate \n\nReasons to choose from among those would be\n\n-predictions about economy/growth rate  (such as retail \u201cconsumer discretionary\u201d will perform well following tax cuts or job growth) \n\n-personal interest/knowledge of companies (a perfectly valid factor as you\u2019re starting with some knowledge and it\u2019s nice to invest in the things you use)\n\nI would pick a sector I\u2019m interested in, google \u201cshould I invest in the _____ sector?\u201d get articles from reputable brokers/sources (common brokerage firms or stock websites) make sure they are recent and read a few to see if they agree. Then I can look up who are top performers in that sector. There are more specific tools but that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend to start with unless you\u2019re just planning to go off a redditor tip.\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Help with choosing stocks", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Help with choosing stocks [deleted]", "parent_score": 0, "parent_ratio": 100}, {"time": 1523464643.0, "submission_id": "8bi1uu", "comment_id": "dx6xahc", "body": "Veritone (VERI) It's an interesting one to study.
