Interesting to see it being buried over the talks about battlefield. Uniquely in a place with No Fifa Alternatives & with a recent World Cup this year...  it may receive an uptick to sales as the sport is fresh in peoples mind.\n   * **Battlefield V(November 20, 2018)**: Its all that's even talked about. Why? Controversy over SJW and the previous handling of EA's title Star wars Battlefront 2. Are the controversies similar? No. Battlefront was about theft (by making the game a slot machine you constantly threw money at).  It hit the world record for most down voted comment on Reddit. Oh and it still managed to sell more than the world expected .  While battlefield V decided to include historical WW2 inaccuracies to be more \"inclusive\" to people playing multiplayer ARENA match. Its not even that big of a deal if you realize its just a **video game** where they want you to feel like the person in the battle against other players that you are engaged in... but everything is so political and EA is utterly hated so it has to be ratcheted up to a 100.  However when you watch just game play of multiplayer without commentary, just pure game play on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7PbkLA_qu0). This is what I watched and see no reason to not play this one when it releases. Now you throw in to the mix this new wave of PUBG/Fortnite FPS and the possible loss of interest in other FPS titles. It throw in a new variable that Carl of duty and Battlefield didn't have to worry about for nearly a decade. So only time will tell if people are bored of Fortnite or will it just continue. We dont know if its going to become a FAD like Pokeman GO or cement itself for the long haul.\n   * **Madden 19(August 10, 2018):** NFL game which again uniquely a sport that is EA's, with no competition. Both \"footballs\" are monopolized by EA. Now Madden has been released and sales weren't as good as last year. Truth is, this is not a sport that's gaining in popularity and with again things being politicized (Kaepernick). More fans are tuning out all together. Not to mention people are shifting from watching sports to watching video games played by professional gamers instead(mostly shooters & tactical action games I might add). And the whole actual shooting incident that took place at a recent Madden tournament. While a tragedy no doubt... if you look at it strictly from a stock perspective... How does this affect the company fundamentally? What makes EA different now than EA 3 months ago? Its not a controversy surrounding EA's video games themselves being the issue but some deranged lunatic. Tensions ease further when you consider that the shooting was at a sports game tournament. We have all heard the argument from politicans & parents that violent video games, where the player is causing mayhem, death and destruction, are a problem. but this was just a sports game... really throws the logic on its head. Maybe that sell off was a bit unwarranted.\n   * **NBA Live 19 (September 14, 2018)** They used to be the top dog for basketball games. But a decade or so ago... this position was been taken by NBA 2K series ($TTWO). NBA Live is pennies compare to 2K. I dont expect much but its still a game some dude out there will buy. EA feels its enough of an investment for it to still be out here and make some kind of profit. They could have just did what TTWO did with NHL 2k Series, took the Loss and never created another one when NHL series by EA outperformed them by magnitudes.\n   * **NHL 19** (**September 14, 2018)** Another sport that EA runs a monopoly on with no competition. This is the fourth game I have mentioned that is about sports. When you sum all these together... you have pretty much every major sport game in the world (they also do UFC but that was back in February).\n\nTruth be told, I cant write for too long, got to hit the bed soon... but I would love to finish this and mention ATVI and TTWO(perhaps Ill write a new post)... especially when you consider how much more bullish i am on TTWO out of all three. But I do find this EA dip a bit overdone over a controversy surrounding a mentally unstable shooter & a political blowback over 1/5 of the products I mentioned above that are hitting the market in the coming weeks... and that game I doubt will make less than battlefront 2 because... battlefield is infinite times more popular of a series, its the only thing keeping non sports fan from completely abandoning EA and actually boycotting.\n\nAlso just in general for all games there are a few points to consider... They always release major titles around this time and tend to go through these yearly cyclical phases... Major titles usually release around this time every year because its so close to Christmas to help boost additional sales while the game is still trending... They way they dont just make money from the initial releases but also from a holiday that is all about gift giving. Then every year new gamers join the ranks. While sure... some old ones may phase out and move on from video games games... truth is there are more adult gamers now (even in their 40s+) than every before and this trend will only continue until we see gamers all over in retirement homes. And female gamers are on a rise too. More girls play games today than ever before.

Why? Controversy over SJW and the previous handling of EA's title Star wars Battlefront 2. Are the controversies similar? No. Battlefront was about theft (by making the game a slot machine you constantly threw money at).  It hit the world record for most down voted comment on Reddit. Oh and it still managed to sell more than the world expected .  While battlefield V decided to include historical WW2 inaccuracies to be more \"inclusive\" to people playing multiplayer ARENA match. Its not even that big of a deal if you realize its just a **video game** where they want you to feel like the person in the battle against other players that you are engaged in... but everything is so political and EA is utterly hated so it has to be ratcheted up to a 100.  However when you watch just game play of multiplayer without commentary, just pure game play on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7PbkLA_qu0). This is what I watched and see no reason to not play this one when it releases. Now you throw in to the mix this new wave of PUBG/Fortnite FPS and the possible loss of interest in other FPS titles. It throw in a new variable that Carl of duty and Battlefield didn't have to worry about for nearly a decade. So only time will tell if people are bored of Fortnite or will it just continue. We dont know if its going to become a FAD like Pokeman GO or cement itself for the long haul.\n   * **Madden 19(August 10, 2018):** NFL game which again uniquely a sport that is EA's, with no competition. Both \"footballs\" are monopolized by EA. Now Madden has been released and sales weren't as good as last year. Truth is, this is not a sport that's gaining in popularity and with again things being politicized (Kaepernick). More fans are tuning out all together. Not to mention people are shifting from watching sports to watching video games played by professional gamers instead(mostly shooters & tactical action games I might add). And the whole actual shooting incident that took place at a recent Madden tournament. While a tragedy no doubt... if you look at it strictly from a stock perspective... How does this affect the company fundamentally? What makes EA different now than EA 3 months ago? Its not a controversy surrounding EA's video games themselves being the issue but some deranged lunatic. Tensions ease further when you consider that the shooting was at a sports game tournament. We have all heard the argument from politicans & parents that violent video games, where the player is causing mayhem, death and destruction, are a problem. but this was just a sports game... really throws the logic on its head. Maybe that sell off was a bit unwarranted.\n   * **NBA Live 19 (September 14, 2018)** They used to be the top dog for basketball games. But a decade or so ago... this position was been taken by NBA 2K series ($TTWO). NBA Live is pennies compare to 2K. I dont expect much but its still a game some dude out there will buy. EA feels its enough of an investment for it to still be out here and make some kind of profit. They could have just did what TTWO did with NHL 2k Series, took the Loss and never created another one when NHL series by EA outperformed them by magnitudes.\n   * **NHL 19** (**September 14, 2018)** Another sport that EA runs a monopoly on with no competition. This is the fourth game I have mentioned that is about sports. When you sum all these together... you have pretty much every major sport game in the world (they also do UFC but that was back in February).\n\nTruth be told, I cant write for too long, got to hit the bed soon... but I would love to finish this and mention ATVI and TTWO(perhaps Ill write a new post)... especially when you consider how much more bullish i am on TTWO out of all three. But I do find this EA dip a bit overdone over a controversy surrounding a mentally unstable shooter & a political blowback over 1/5 of the products I mentioned above that are hitting the market in the coming weeks... and that game I doubt will make less than battlefront 2 because... battlefield is infinite times more popular of a series, its the only thing keeping non sports fan from completely abandoning EA and actually boycotting.\n\nAlso just in general for all games there are a few points to consider... They always release major titles around this time and tend to go through these yearly cyclical phases... Major titles usually release around this time every year because its so close to Christmas to help boost additional sales while the game is still trending... They way they dont just make money from the initial releases but also from a holiday that is all about gift giving. Then every year new gamers join the ranks.

Therefore, treat it as a business. No room for emotional decisions. The more you think business like, the better you develop the required temperament.\n\nUnderstand the different investing vehicles out there. Indexing is convenient, but I personally prefer to invest in individual stocks because my goals when investing are oriented towards safety, income, and consistency. Many companies from the index fail to meet this criteria.  Therefore, I don't do index investing, because I don't want to be invested in these companies. \nThe other factor is valuation - when purchasing the index, I cannot choose to buy a company at or below its intrinsic value.  I need to buy the whole package paying market price for all companies, which will contain overvalued ones too. Buying any business when overvalued drags return. Plus there's MER that compounds every year. BUT, investing in individual companies is not for everyone, it takes a lot of time and research, so if you don't enjoy the process you will be better off indexing. Understand what each type entails to so you can make an informed decision that suits your style, goals and risk tolerance.\n\nTemperament is the most critical skill. Emotions (greed and fear) is what destroy any wealth, at any age, even if one decides to simply invest in SP500 ETF. If at year 9 we have another 2001 or 2008 or 1929 or even 1987, Mr Smart might become Mr Risky in no time. Meanwhile, someone with proper temperament can indeed benefit from what is perceived as Mr Risky, provided that proper controls to mitigate risks (validating that fundamentals are disconnected from stock price) are in place. Anyone can learn it if they put time and effort into it. \n \nIf you do choose the route to invest in individual stocks.... then I would give the following additional advice:\n\nHave a diversified portfolio. Nobody knew that GE or C would be so adversely affected to the point that it comprises fundamentals. Like Buffett says, \"buy a company so solid that any idiot can run it, because eventually, one will \". My diversification strategy is about having exposure to 10 sectors, and buy the leaders on those sectors.  \n\nIt's a business partnership. You don't measure results in a week or a month or a year. You will know in 5 years from now if you made a good decision, which is about what a business cycle lasts. Track earnings and cash flow yearly, read their earnings transcript and annual reports, become familiar with the industry and business they operate on.  When I am investing in a business, I am buying the company's future earnings power and dividend growth potential.  Companies report results 4 times a year only. Hence investing is for the long term, it takes time for stock price to follow earnings. Fundamentals cannot change as fast as the stock quotes, so the daily price quote is just a distraction that needs to be filtered out.\n\nStart small. You can always scale up later. \n\nStick to your plan. Have it figured out before you buy anything. You should know what to buy, when to buy and when to sell (as a strategy) before you begin. Follow it strictly. One of the primary reasons why investors often make bad investment decisions is because their judgment is usually based only on price movement. Price movements alone can be very misleading. A rising stock price will often lure an investor to stay calm, creating a false sense of security where they believe that all is well. On the other hand, a falling stock price usually creates anxiety and sometimes leads to outright panic. These feelings can be rational as long as they are justified by sound fundamentals. Knowing the differences between rational and emotional reactions will make all the difference.\n\nMistakes will be made. It doesn't mean the strategy is broken. What matters is your consistency, so you only make rational decisions, not emotional ones. As Charlie Munger said once: \"As long as you are consistent on how you value business, your degree of inaccuracy, if it\u2019s replicated through consistency, will lead to a great model for a relative valuations. So if your valuation model is not sophisticated, does not take into account six dozen variables, well, as long as you\u2019re applying it the same way to every company and you are looking at a lot of different companies, you will have a useful model for relative valuation which can lead to very superior investment returns.\" \n\nInvesting is a business, and like every business, there will be period of locking losses. However, a diversified portfolio built consistently seeking quality and valuation will always deliver superior results, with winners higher and more often than losers. The big risk of total loss associated with equities (on a diversified portfolio built with quality and valuation in mind) is quite rare, and more fear-based than fact-based. Furthermore, the risk associated with a falling stock price, especially when the underlying business remains strong, is more related to investor action than pure loss. In other words, the greatest risk of a falling stock price is how the investor reacts to it.\n \nYou don't lose one cent until you sell. There will be bear markets, recessions, negative market sentiment. Separate the erratic moods of Mr. Market from the financial health of each business. Hence investing is for long term, you need time to find out how management will react and adapt to continue growing earnings and cash flow. It's their job to figure it out, not the analysts or yours. Yours is just to allocate capital. \n\nDon't monitor it daily. Investing in dividend growth stocks makes money while you sleep. Don't stress over it, give time for fundamentals to reflect on stock price. Any business public or private, derives its value based on the underlying performance that the business generates. These value drivers include, but are not limited to, operating results such as earnings, cash flows, sales (revenues) and dividends. Common sense tells us that the true value of a large multinational business, or any business for that matter, cannot possibly change as quickly or as much as daily price quotations would indicate. Stock prices in the short run can be driven by strong emotions such as fear and greed.  The intrinsic value of a business is driven by fundamentals and can be calculated within a reasonable degree of certainty. Once this calculation is made, sound investing decisions can be made and implemented.\n\nBeing a value investor is more about discipline than it is about intelligence. We can't control price fluctuations, but we can control the quality of the companies we purchase. The higher the quality, the more confident I am that the company will bounce back on any price drops.\n\nSuccessful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. No business is capable of generating perfect long-term operating results. Inevitably, there will be a bad year, a bad quarter, or even a few bad years or bad quarters.  However, a weak quarter or year does not necessarily imply that a sound business model is no longer valid. Businesses are competitive, economies are cyclical, and good managements respond and adapt. That's why I wait at least 4 or 5 years of declining earnings and estimates that continue to decline before I decide to sell (what I call \"ceasing the partnership with that business\"). \n\nRead The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham and Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits by Philip Fisher the annual letters to shareholder from Berkshire Hathaway. Tons of consistent wisdom there, like this quote from 1988 letter: \"In any sort of a contest - financial, mental, or physical - it's an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that it's useless to even try\". Or this quote from 2014 letter: \"Stock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term, however, currency-denominated instruments are riskier investments \u2013 far riskier investments \u2013 than widely-diversified stock portfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. That lesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy for risk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.\"\n\nMost importantly: have fun. Investing is a journey, never a final destination, so enjoy the process while you learn and get better at it. It never ends. \n\nMy investing approach is towards dividend growth stocks, so I can live off the perpetual growth income that they will provide when I reach financial independence.
