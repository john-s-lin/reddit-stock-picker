I know reddit hates active management but sometimes it\u2019s a great tool to meet your investing goals without getting involved. \n\nIf you want to save some money and feel like you can manage it yourself then buying a regular index fund is fine. With your amount of capital I recommend diversifying into at least a couple of different funds. I have no idea of your risk tolerance or financial situation so I don\u2019t feel comfortable recommending anything. There are a ton of great funds that meet almost every goal an investor can have at low fees. I personally have a Growth fund, small cap, technology fund, and a fixed income fund. \n\nAnd lastly if you want a lower fee managed account that is run by algorithms. Fidelity Go has an expense of 0.35% but this also includes the underlying mutual fund fees. It rebalances your portfolio based on your goals/risk and is very hands off besides that.
