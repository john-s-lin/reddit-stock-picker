So, I am posting it here again as I'd really like to hear a few opinions on this one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe company [Sharc Energy Systems](http://www.sharcenergy.com/) [recently](http://globenewswire.com/Search?organization=Sharc%20International%20Systems%20Inc.):\n\n\n1. [won a prestigious industry award](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/11/20/1197778/0/en/SHARC-Helps-Borders-College-Win-Prestigious-Industry-Award.html) ([Green Gown Awards](http://www.greengownawards.org/)) for providing a campus with [95 percent](https://www.fenews.co.uk/press-releases/16506-scottish-labour-shadow-minister-visits-award-winning-green-energy-site-at-borders-college) of its needed heat by using energy from the **sewerage**.\n\n2. was used by [SmithGroupJJR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmithGroupJJR) and [Skanska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanska) to build [DC Water's HQ](https://www.usa.skanska.com/who-we-are/media/press-releases/171840/Skanska-builds-the-new-D.C.-Water-headquarters-in-Washington%2C-D.C.%2C-USA%2C-for-USD-60M). The building achieves and surpasses [LEED\u00ae Platinum Certification](https://new.usgbc.org/leed) from the [U.S. Green Building Council](https://new.usgbc.org/).\n\n3. established a Joint Venture with [Scottish Government](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/20/1442496/0/en/SHARC-Energy-Systems-UK-and-Scottish-Water-Horizons-Launch-JV-to-Support-Green-Energy-Agenda.html) called Bandwith (YouTube: watch?v=UM5LChtLBZA), \"which has created a $36.8 million CAD pipeline of potential installations across Scotland\".\n\n4. joined forces with [Highmark NY](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/23/1449199/0/en/SHARC-Announces-Agreement-with-HIGHMARK-NY-to-Sell-Its-Waste-Water-Energy-Recycling-Systems-in-New-York-City-Market.html) to \"extend product sales into the New York City metro area\".\n\n5. [sold a system](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/09/1419688/0/en/SHARC-and-Environmental-Technology-Solutions-to-Launch-Australia-s-First-Piranha-System.html) to Meriton Group for testing. [Meriton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriton) has 15k(!) apartments in development pipeline and their projects equate to ~0.05 % of Australia\u2019s GDP.\n\n6. CEO [Lynn Mueller](http://www.sharcenergy.com/?team=lynn-mueller) has over 25 years of experience in geothermal heat pump sales and used to be president of [WaterFurnace](https://www.waterfurnace.com/).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe company also has several other projects in the [pipeline](https://www.worldwatertechnorthamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lynn-Mueller-SHARC-Energy-Systems.pdf):\n\n1. a [joint venture in California](http://www.sharcenergy.com/us60-million-financing-commitment-1000-iws-systems-california/) with \"funding of $60 Mio. USD over five years\" and production expected in Q1 2018. So, probably sooner than later now...\n\n2. working with [BC Hydro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Hydro) to implement Sharc systems in educational institutes. Probably in British Columbia as BC Hydro is owned by the government of British Columbia.\n\n3. Several sites in Australia were identified for Sharc and Piranha systems and are in planning stages.\n\n4. Planning stages for district heating opportunities in Richmond, Ottawa, Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll these things sound very promising to me, still Sharc's current **market cap is only $12.5 Mio. CAD**. And that's why I'd really like to know what you guys think. (Sharc, btw, went public through a [reverse IPO](https://biv.com/article/2015/10/international-wastewater-goes-public-through-rever) in October 2015. Older data is from Amana Copper Ltd.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Disclosure: I already own some shares of Sharc, and am asking, because I am not sure whether it's right or wrong to get more...*", "parent_text": "I think the product is fantastic, it's turning wastewater aka nothing into energy. And as far as competitors are concerned I just today got a mail from their IR: \n\n&nbsp;\n\n*There are a couple of other competitors in the sense that they either do some screening or heat recovery but not in the way that we do. We have been able to differentiate ourselves by offering full (project assistance from conception, to design, to build, to install, to commissioning, to service) if required by the client. We also have equipment that will not only cover a much broader flow requirement (from low to high vs high flow) and have equipment that is completely sealed and can be situated within standard mechanical rooms (or other rooms) of buildings.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, the management is very experienced and one of them is former premier of British Columbia and mayor of Vancouver. So, they don't need to build a network, they have one to rely on. And WaterFurnace with Lynn Mueller, btw, was 100x. So, to me it seems to be a great package.
