It would take you 10 years to get your money back and your PE would be 10. \n\nSome stocks have very high PEs or none at all because its expect to grow or haven\u2019t made a profit yet. Imagine buying that 100k home to rent out to one day find out that a Disneyland were to open right next door in a few years. You can be sure you\u2019ll be getting more than $833 per month eventually so people will pay more for the house. Maybe they\u2019ll even pay $300k the day of the news. That would bring your PE to 30 initially. Pretty high, but maybe and likely you can rent it out for 2500 one day, which would eventually bring your PE back to 10. \n\nAlways compare a company\u2019s PE with similar companies.

Imagine buying that 100k home to rent out to one day find out that a Disneyland were to open right next door in a few years. You can be sure you\u2019ll be getting more than $833 per month eventually so people will pay more for the house. Maybe they\u2019ll even pay $300k the day of the news. That would bring your PE to 30 initially. Pretty high, but maybe and likely you can rent it out for 2500 one day, which would eventually bring your PE back to 10. \n\nAlways compare a company\u2019s PE with similar companies.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 486,000 patients receive emergency medical treatment for burns annually. Burn injuries result in approximately 3,400 deaths each year, the third-leading cause of accidental home injury deaths. Burns covering up to 90 percent of a persons body surface area, once considered fatal injuries, have become survivable with appropriate treatment. Although split-thickness autografts are the current standard treatment, grafting is associated with significant donor site pain, delayed healing and scarring.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*IQVIA, with support from AVITA Medical and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), developed a Burn Care Pathway Health Economic Model to determine cost savings to burn centers as a result of using the RECELL System compared to the current standard of care to treat second- and third-degree burns of varying sizes. The validated model demonstrates that using the RECELL System alone in second-degree burns or in combination with autografts in third-degree burns reduces hospital costs and length of stay, regardless of comorbidities, lowering the cost of treatment by 44 percent or more for patients with large burns. In addition, the model concluded that in a 200-bed burn center, the use of the RECELL System would reduce annual total treatment costs by USD $13 million.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*In anticipation of approval, AVITA Medical has undertaken substantial efforts to prepare for the U.S. market launch. These initiatives include the recruitment of sales and marketing leadership highly experienced in regenerative medicine and the treatment of burns, completion and assimilation of extensive direct market research, and establishment of pricing and reimbursement strategies and support infrastructure. With the receipt of FDA approval, the Company will finalize its product packaging and promotional materials to reflect the final approval details and will complete the recruitment and hiring of its field sales team. The Company expects to formally launch the RECELL System in the U.S. in the fourth calendar quarter of 2018.

The reason for this is equity(share)holders are subordinate to bondholders. Basically, if the company goes bankrupt bondholders are prioritised in receiving (any) money back. Shareholders have ownership that's why they are last in line. The reason for subtracting the net debt is to give a fair equity value that is only relevant to the shareholders (correct me if I am wrong though).

The reason for this is equity(share)holders are subordinate to bondholders. Basically, if the company goes bankrupt bondholders are prioritised in receiving (any) money back. Shareholders have ownership that's why they are last in line. The reason for subtracting the net debt is to give a fair equity value that is only relevant to the shareholders (correct me if I am wrong though).

Combine that with historically seeing Amazon keep breaking that record can cause people to say that they want a stake.\n\nI bought Amazon at $350 and sold it at $750ish. I'm happy I took a profit, but then it crushed $900, $1000, $1200 (bought back in here), $1500, $1900, and $2000 is right around the corner.\n\nJust because a company reaches peak, it does not guarantee that is the peak. Kinda like a false summit.\n\nThe other aspect of stocks like Amazon is that the single stock price requires a VERY LARGE investment of money upfront, especially for the average investor. This makes it harder for someone to buy just $100 in the company or better yet, try to sell $100 worth when the time comes. Every decision has a lot more weight to it, and some day it might be too difficult to buy a single share of the company. So people buy it now while they can afford it, even if it means putting 50% of your portfolio into one single company.\n\nI see Amazon as a list of many companies where I \"can't afford to not have a stake in it\". I won't list all my companies I've taken small stakes in, but there's a large list of promising companies that still can improve in my eyes. That being said, Amazon is NOT worth holding more than 20% of your portfolio in my opinion, so unless you have $10,000 or more, you're making a very reckless decision. Hell, 20% is probably too much as well. I'm too much of a wimp to invest beyond what I have in AMZN already. I can't increase that percentage of allocation to a single company. There are many things that could completely shatter the Amazon confidence running around today, including the CEO having medical issues (see Steve Jobs), regulation forcing their warehouse work environments to improve immensely, competition from other retail stores trying to compete (they don't have to beat Amazon, but they could find themselves taking a larger slice of the pie), any illegal or unethical activities being uncovered, whistleblowers, etc.\n\nThere's a saying I heard years ago that was along the lines of \"I don't have to kill God. I just need to show the world he can bleed. His followers will kill him shortly after that.\" The second Amazon has a fallback, we might see a huge chain reaction of people snapping out of the euphoria and panic-selling because they are over-allocated and need to take some profits before someone else does. Buying at the top, then having Jeff Bezos be diagnosed with a medical condition, could cause such an alarming scene.\n\nAmazon is a scary beast for investment.

(mostly pros) \n\nAmazon is an epic growth story that grew 100% this year. With diversification in so many different fronts that I can't even comprend the list. Bezos has become what I call a meta businessman. In that he can buy or start anything using his meta business principals and turn it in to a money making machine. Even if he's late to the game. Perfect example is Siri and how it dominated the customer facing voice AI service.. Today it's nothing compared to Alexa. The same is true for alot of his other enterprises. The problem of course is how long can this reign continue? They don't make profits(mostly reinvested) and are valued for future growth. It only takes one slight turn before the cards start falling. Then his treatment of his worked has really bugged alot of consumers and politicians alike. So he's not without contravesy either. Things like horrible pay and horrible hours to name a few. . And alot of competition for Amazon is emerging as well.  While not an issue, mircosoft has been making amazing strides in the cloud business front.. Yes, AWS utterly dominates this domain... But in terms of cloud growth.. Azure is growing each quarter 40% faster. Azure has gone from 5% to 10% total cloud market control. His venture in food has been mixed thus far and Walmart is revitalizing itself here.. . Disney is about to drop the bomb on the streaming business that shouldn't be over looked. Even with all that... I wouldn't bet against him any time soon.\n\nGoogle on the other hand is killing/dominating in the streaming, communication, search engine, application, advertisment front. And they actually make money each quarter to put in a vault. They are treated better fundamentally by investors so it makes them a much safer investment even if things go sour. But they have problems of their own as you may have seen with EU treating them as a evil monopoly and all. However what I like about them is that they are at the cutting edge of future tech even if it's not something they can profit on now. This means that, 10,20 years they will have products /services ready to be monotized and replicated by others. Being a leader in this front is always a boon. Their cloud front at the enterprise level is a joke compared to msft and amazon.. But they are nothing to look down on when it comes to end user cloud services. Most of us use g drive, Gmail etc. Which targets a different audience that currently amazon does not compete with. And as the world becomes more and more tech oriented, the world is more likely to use Google services (ad based free services) than any other. They sell their software to third parties to make their own products from. Making them the meta tech that will sit on top of all others. \n\nIn all honesty it's hard to pick one or the other (for the next 4 years atleast) as nothing is going to slow them down. Africa, South Asia and many other places are still open for future ventures/customers by both of them as emerging markets grow (provided China doesn't aggresively do a better job)... so personally I would just split between the two..\n\nNext couple of months however... I pick Amazon, simply because he just needs to show growth not profits.. while Google has to do both.\n\nAlso dont discount Microsoft. I am way more bullish on them than these two.", "score": 4, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Which is a better buy now, AMZN or GOOGL?", "submission_text": "For a shorter/long term position... which do you prefer over the next few months?
