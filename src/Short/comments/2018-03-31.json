Even if TSLA finally meets its production quotas, it can't and won't hold the top field in electric cars.

Do you need the money? I\u2019m assuming if you invested in TSLA, it was because you believe in the long term vision. If that\u2019s the case, why would you sell now, a few months before Tesla will have doubled, then tripled their production rate (from 2k/wk Model S/X to 6k/wk Model S/X/3)? Nothing changed last week. Moody\u2019s downgraded their credit rating based on information that we had in January. A driver crashed on Autopilot - a driver assistance system that requires each user to agree that they are still responsible for the vehicle\u2019s actions while on Autopilot. And tech got destroyed in the macro environment. None of these are material to TSLA\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nIf your analysis led you to buy TSLA because you believe it is a good investment over the long term, don\u2019t let this immaterial bear cycle distract you. Shit like this happens all the time, and it\u2019s always the worst time to sell. The Model 3 ramp is behind what Tesla wanted, but if you take away guidance it\u2019s pretty impressive. 9 months in and it is now going to be the best selling EV in the US every month from now until the Model Y comes out and then Tesla will have the top two spots until the pickup comes out, and then they\u2019ll probably have the top 3 spots for a long, long time. We are literally right at the beginning of that *today*. \n\nThat being said, if you aren\u2019t comfortable having 25% in one highly volatile stock, reallocate a bit.

Full stop.\n\nMost of the costs to produce the model 3 have already been spent, the production is slower than expected but is picking up.

The bolt looks like a fishbowl Homer Simpson designed classic.  What about the Smart Ev for two? No thank you.  Even if there was a compelling competitor to the model 3, the supercharge network still puts be Tesla in the lead. \n\nThat being said, this stock is volatile.  Haters and Fudsters are nasty and jump on any opportunity to bash the stock, the company and the CEO.\n\nTesla isint just distrupting the auto space, take a look at every city in the world. They are littered with car dealership and gas stations.  This has been cash cows in the past for many and many have a lot to lose if Tesla is successful. Those profits that historically went to dealership will no fall in Tesla lap. \n\nThis FUD cycle is the largest threat that Tesla currently has.  How many car accidents happened over the last week?  Why is that you only heard about one in the news?  People crash using cruise control, teenagers are txting while driving and get into accidents everyday. No one is banning Apple.

That being said, the stock may be incredibly volatile in the coming months.  I would buy the dips as they have a strong portfolio of growth and could easily be worth 500 billion in the near term.  If they created an app store with products and services on their automobiles and partnered with Google, Amazon, Apple (Not likely on any of these) or developed their own app store specific to cars like radio while basically creating a marketplace within the car, they would be well worth that amount.  Something as simple as allowing an app store where coders can after a safety assessment and a yearly app store fee can put their app on the store and be able to sell in the car when it is parked only.  This would easily create growth and liquidity in a highly illiquid market.  Something as simple as being able to read the car's check engine light or stuff like.  A car is now a piece of hardware and they could easily and later pay for a service later with a tap on their screen such as a rear facing camera mount that can sync up with the screen so that you can have a camera when you back up if it wasn't installed.

Bad news? That's the \"haters\"  (and really, has any time that a company has ever done something like tell employees to prove the haters wrong ever worked out well in the end? spoiler: very rarely) and other BS, no one ever questions Elon and that's the problem with Tesla. Company repeatedly misses production targets, \"Oh they meant to do that.\" \"That must be part of Elon's plan, to consistently overpromise and underdeliver.\"\n\nThere will be people who ride this all the way down thinking that Elon is gonna save everything and that it's all the \"evil shorts\" fault or some nonsense rather than actually doing any sort of critical thinking and questioning whether there are issues with the company. It's super culty and the true believers will never blame who they really should: they'll all say it's all someone ele's fault, not the company's. Saying that those who criticize the company are \"haters\" should be not be some sort of rallying cry, it should be embarrassing. It's a really childish way of answering criticism and saying that our issues are everyone else's fault but our own.\n\nAdditionally, people really bought into the whole \"Tesla is trying to save the world\" stuff and they \"feel\" good about the investment and the purchase and that's all that matters to them when in reality this is a status symbol company with major QC/production issues. Status symbol cars with poor quality control (seems like every day I'm reading about someone disappointed with build quality or people rejecting delivery) are not saving the planet. The company's a cult of personality and for the people who think Elon is going to leave one day (it wouldn't surprise me that much), longs had better hope that they have left the stock before that happens as the exodus of true believers will be quite the sight.\n\nIf someone's buying this, it's much lower and in distress at that point. Elon's cult is going to be like \"PLZ TIM COOK BUY TESLA WE TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD, DONT U WANNA SAVE THE WORLD?\"\n\nIf Tesla does go to 0 what happens to the Supercharger network? How many reservation holders who plunked down a deposit will be left and find themselves as unsecured creditors? Will there be a \"run on the deposits\" before then if the company gets distressed enough and people try to get their money back en masse?\n\nSorry to hear about OP's loss on the stock, but this faith in Elon has to stop being an investment thesis for people at some point especially after constantly not meeting goals and having a lengthy list of execs fleeing the company. \n\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 59, "submission_ratio": 0.03389830508474576, "submission_title": "TSLA - Hold or Sell", "submission_text": "The past week as you probably know, has been terrible for Tesla stock.

It\u2019s immaterial.\n\nI fail to see how your fence building plans are relevant, but your argument appears to be that Tesla has too much demand. As an investor, I\u2019m ok with that problem. They are obviously ramping up production to fulfill that demand as fast as possible, and production is increasing each month.\n\nMoody\u2019s downgraded the credit rating based on information we had in January. Anyone that is even sort of paying attention is aware of the state of production. Moody\u2019s said that if production improves they will evaluate the rating again.

My name is TeslaDaily because that\u2019s the name of my podcast. Why would a paid shill put Tesla in their name?\n\nAutopilot is a driver assistance system which requires the driver to agree that they are still responsible for the actions of the vehicle. Any accident is unfortunate, but Tesla vehicles with Autopilot are in 40% fewer accidents than those without. The NTSB is doing their due diligence, as they should, and as they have with past Autopilot accidents. As usual, they will find that Autopilot functioned as described by Tesla. Automatic emergency braking is not designed for stationary objects, it is designed to quickly respond to moving objects that have stopped or appeared suddenly. This is all in the manual, and this is similar to other automakers. Just because the stock fell on this news does not make the news material to the fundamentals of TSLA.\n\nThe recall is because of a faulty part from Bosche, a massive supplier to the whole industry. Bosche is covering the costs. There have been no safety issues due to this recall yet. Recalls are a part of being an automaker. Can you list examples of other automakers that have not had recalls? It\u2019s immaterial.\n\nI fail to see how your fence building plans are relevant, but your argument appears to be that Tesla has too much demand. As an investor, I\u2019m ok with that problem. They are obviously ramping up production to fulfill that demand as fast as possible, and production is increasing each month.\n\nMoody\u2019s downgraded the credit rating based on information we had in January. Anyone that is even sort of paying attention is aware of the state of production. Moody\u2019s said that if production improves they will evaluate the rating again. Tesla has said that their updated production targets don\u2019t require additional capital.\n\nSounds like you just read headlines without taking the time to understand the actual impact of the news.", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}, {"time": 1531553929.0, "submission_id": "88nxfw", "comment_id": "e2d74hz", "body": "The lack of big money share holders.Coupled with the fact that they are clearly catering to their share holders.

The US wants to see Qualcomm remain an independent US firm -- it has no ability to ensure that Qualcomm remains a -competitive- global firm. Qualcomm does indeed have a number of 5g patents, but I refer you to examples like Tivo -- when you are making your money from royalty streams vs. actual product innovation, your growth is linked to the growth of other corporations. note I'm not saying QCOM is going bankrupt..just that they are playing in a space which is going to be a brutal knife fight over the next few years. \n\nAs for why Micron is a better play on IOT/cloud -- every computing device has a couple key elements for it to work using current compute models: a processor(s), memory and some variable amount of storage. Every single computing thing from a solar powered calculator to an automated self driving vehicle has these components. So any IOT type device will be sourcing from/giving money to to manufacturers of these 3 components.\n\nThe processor market (see intel) has fractured with specialty chips (ARM/NVDA) creating customized processors specific to the task vs. buying intel/AMD classic 8086 architecture. Its not clear at all that Intel can win/dominate this space (see bad decisions re: ARM). \n\nThe storage market is undergoing a phase shift from classic hard drives (spinning discs) to SSDs/flash. Due to SSD/flash relative insensitivity to vibration, and their smaller form factor their deployment can go forward in places where the market simply didn't exist before (cars). Demand here is huge but there are still a number of players in this space (Samsung dominates) - making SSD although a huge market opportunity, highly likely to be subject to the cyclicality of past semi conductor boom/busts.\n\nFinally there is memory, and memory is where things are different -- historically there were dozens of memory manufacturers in the market place propped up by various governments (Japan/Korea/Taiwan), over time however the majority of these have gone bankrupt/been bought out to the point where memory now exists as an oligopoly -- Samsung, Hynix and Micron. Further -- memory is memory, while it comes in different form factors and speeds, random access memory is a compute standard.  Fab plants to produce dram are hugely expensive to build (billions) and China is the last government trying to create its own semiconductor industry since most of the IP in this space is tightly locked down. \n\nThis means that we are in a \"special\" situation where just as the market for computing device is about to go parabolic (IOT), the supply for additional memory is relatively constrained. [supply growth is around 20%/year where arguably demand growth due to IOT is well in excess of that]\n\nFor micron (2/3 of revenue == memory) this means huge cash flow until the oligopoly breaks down. The problem/opportunity with Micron is that there is a 30 year+ history of semiconductor cycles which has most/many people believing that additional supply (whether its from Samsung/Hynix or China) will exceed market demand creating a collapse in prices and thereby margins. \n\nIf you buy the IOT story, this collapse is not highly probable since market demand is so high -- as prices fall, new applications/use cases will be developed to absorb supply.
