Starbucks is doing what companies do when they reach saturation: They start to manage the middle of their p&l (belt tightening). The first thing that gets cut is labor. Starbucks is going to go through a very uncomfortable year or two. Eventually, the Chinese market will take off, and they'll find some more growth.

You get less fees if you invest with the broker you're with. If you have vanguard and you invest in a fidelity mutual fund. You get charged $50 for buying and selling that fund.\n\nAlso in etfs are better than mutual funds. They get charged less fees usually, and if you want to buy/sell them you can do it right away instead of waiting till the end of the day for orders to go through.\n\nThe index fund etfs are SPY for the S&P500 which is the same as VFINX, QQQ for the NASDAQ, and DJX for the DOW. If you specifically want to invest in an index fund, I'd personally suggest Nasdaq over S&P. Nasdaq is tech heavy, and technology just keeps getting better and better, it is also slightly more volatile which means it sees more ups and downs. But the gains are bigger. Nasdaq gained 26.5% the past year, while S&P gained 15.5% the past year. S&P is the 500 biggest companies which include many financials which don't always do well, also airlines and retail which are both doing poorly. Nasdaq and S&P are pretty similar in companies investment weight right now, so there really isn't much advantage over investing in the S&P over the Nasdaq. S&P dipped 11% earlier this year, and Nasdaq dipped 12% during the same time period for example. Though they might be changing that soon, maybe? \n\n\nIf you wanna dig deeper into stocks I suggest reading around here often and playing around with this website: https://finviz.com/screener.ashx You can find many good funds and stocks using that site.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1533741129.0, "submission_id": "95kyu7", "comment_id": "e3ttzjy", "body": "Thank you!", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 0.25, "submission_title": "Fidelity vs Vanguard index?", "submission_text": "I have a few grand I wanted to invest into vanguards index fund.

Sure, it would be subjective to say Nvidia's brand carries a lot of weight, but outside of the tech/investing world people may be less familiar. Disney brand power however, is entrenched into society. Ask any random passerby on the street if they know what Disney is. Then ask them if they know Nvidia. For many, Disney has been a part of people's lives from cradle to grave. I myself don't even like Disney movies, products, services, park, merchandise, etc. but god damnit I cannot avoid them and the loyalty people have to the brand is the envy of most other companies.\n\n>care to expand on these 2 points?\n\nAbsolutely. Regarding valuation, the Walt Disney Company trades at roughly 16.9x earnings. That's a fair premium in my opinion, but of course there's more to it than just P/E. Sales and EPS growth have both been positive over a 5 year time frame, at 5.45% and 12.73% respectably. Double-digit EPS growth forecasts are expected in the next few years, if you pay attention to forecasts (I personally don't). Disney pays roughly 1.5% in annual dividends, and that dividend has grown by 16.1%, 21.1%, and 22% in the last 10, 5, and 3 years. The dividend growth is a great element of this potential investment and a sign of the company's financial health. Net profit margins are also a healthy 18.5%, while the cash flow margin is also a healthy 21.33% and return on equity is roughly 23.07%. In sum, the company is in good financial health. In my opinion, their acquisitions of Pixar Studios, Marvel Entertainment, and the Star Wars franchise were expensive deals but ultimately savvy buys that integrated well with the company overall. Bob Iger is a great CEO and I personally think he's positioned Disney is very competitively in the industry. They're truly in a league of their own. Now, as for the moat, which you also asked about. An economic moat, or competitive advantage, is something absolutely crucial to my own personal investment criteria. Disney has a wide moat. Its media networks segment and collection of Disney-branded businesses have demonstrated strong pricing power in the past few years. ESPN, another subsidiary of Disney, is the dominant force in U.S. sports entertainment. ESPN's brand strength allow it to charge the highest subscriber fees of any network, which in turn generate stable profits. ESPN uses these profits to reinforce its position by acquiring long-term sports programming rights, including the NFL, the NBA, and college football and basketball. The media network component also includes the Disney Channel, one of two dominant cable networks for children, which allows Disney to introduce and extend its strong IP and content portfolio. ABC, one of the four major broadcast networks, offers an outlet to reach almost all 116 million households in the U.S. Granted cable television is on a slow decline, but Disney's networks allow advertisers one of the few ways of reaching a mass audience, which also generates substantial income for Disney. Disney has mastered the process of monetizing its world-renowned characters and franchises across multiple platforms. The company has moved beyond the historical view of a brand that children recognize and parents trust by acquiring and creating new franchises and intellectual property. Recent success with the Pixar and Marvel franchises has helped to create new opportunities with adults who may have outgrown their attraction to the company's traditional characters. The recent acquisition of Lucasfilm added another avenue to remain engaged with children and adults. Disney uses the success of its filmed entertainment not only to drive DVD sales, but also to create new experiences at its parks and resorts, merchandising, TV programming, and even Broadway shows. Each new franchise deepens the Disney library, which will continue to generate value over the years. Overall, Disney is not just a Mickey Mouse Donald Duck kid's brand. It's an absolute behemoth of a media conglomerate, with strong brand power, timeless intellectual property, rare cult-following from consumers, at a fair price. Now, when it comes down to this and Nvidia, which is a neat company in its own right, I know which one I'd rather own. So there's my rationale, you don't have to agree wholeheartedly, but maybe you get a better idea of the big picture and why I think DIS is a better buy than NVDA right now.

You'll definitely sleep much easier this way.\n\nIf you're asking if you should sell, assuming you currently hold shares of Ryanair, my advice would be yes, especially if you've made any profit. Strikes aside, Ryanair isn't a quality company--and they're only competing on price--which is not enough of a competitive or even dynamic in business, in my personal opinion. Even the employees of Ryanair are generally dissatisfied with their jobs; ask most Ryanair workers about whether or not they like working for Ryanair and the consensus is skewed negative. You can even check out the employee reviews online for verification. Even so, the strikes across Europe speak for themselves.\n\nNow, from the perspective of a consumer: I very recently flew Ryanair. It is without a doubt not a company I'd invest a single penny of my cash into. Why? It's just not a good business. Ryanair competes on price, and price alone; in my own opinion, this is not enough of a competitive or even sustainable dynamic in an industry ripe with cost-cutting competition. Furthermore, this becomes apparent when you become a passenger. You are constantly faced with baloney advertisements throughout the entire process of being a Ryanair passenger. There are spam ads for upgraded services from the point in which you book, the days preceding your flight, before you board the plane, and even during the flight itself--they even advertise a goddamn ham sandwich for 10 euro inches from your face on the seat in front of you for the entire duration of your flight. Moreover, there aren't even seat back pockets, the seats that don't recline are no more comfortable than a folding conference chair, and you have to pay to bring anything other than a backpack on the plane. The cabins have been battered through the years of use, and it seems Ryanair is not interested in spending a dime to refresh them--even the overhead compartments have turned white-ish/yellow from the countless hours of service. Logistically, the airline is also a headache. It's such common knowledge that Ryanair will be delayed, that most people already account for it in their travels. Overall, this is just not a company I'd like to own a single piece of, and even if I had to choose an airline, it definitely wouldn't be this one. So in sum, if you hold shares, sell.

Major props to you for using a demo account before investing your real money. I myself did the same thing for a year, and I can't recommend it enough; I learned so many lessons without any of the risk. I'd like to suggest using the Investopedia stock simulator for this. You can adjust your budget and various other settings and compete against others if you want, all for free. Nowadays, I manage my own portfolio via Charles Schwab, which outperforms the benchmark (S&P 500 index), and I'm thankful I learned some key basics beforehand. I'd be happy to offer some tips and advice to help you start off. If I were to sum the best piece of advice I could ever give in one sentence it would be:\n\nDon't *speculate*, but i*nvest* in shares of quality, financially strong, well-managed companies (treat them like *companies*, not stocks) with a clear competitive advantage at a fair (or even undervalued) price. **It's really just as simple as that.**\n\nNow, for many, that is simply too much work, not enough thrill, or they do so and then quit due to a lack of discipline and patience. For the enterprising investor starting out just like yourself here are some investment landmines that you must try to avoid stepping on if you want to build long term wealth:\n\n* Avoid penny stocks. They are that cheap for a reason.\n* Don't day trade. Very, very, *very* few people can do this well, and those people are not us. An even smaller percentage can do it consistently. Also, save the headache of constantly trading shit companies and staring at decimals all day long. You won't sleep at night this way. Don't play yourself here.\n* Don't trade options or leverage unless you are a real professional investor. Seriously. Let's not play ourselves into thinking we are. At one point you'll be tempted by leverage and derivates and think \"huh, easy money?\" --nope. There's a reason why the vast majority of folks lose money on options. They got in over their heads. Don't let that be you.\n* Diversifying for the sake of diversification is important if you do not want to spend your time picking companies; it will protect you from risk over the long term. ETFs are an excellent way to get instant diversification. However, once you become good enough to identify good investments and you wish to devote some more time to researching, diversifying for the sake of it just becomes protection against ignorance. Pick a handful of investments, and run with them into battle. Nobody ever get rich on their 10th best idea.\n* Discipline, patience, and rationale are probably just as important as research; if you've got a great investment, you do not have to worry about a 25% decrease in share price, you're young (presumably) so ride it out. Just make sure you buy in at fair or undervalued prices to begin with.\n* Buying shares of a great company isn't the same as making a good investment; you must greatly consider the price at which you purchase shares to make any sort of profit. There will be companies you absolutely love that do not currently sell for good prices, it's perfectly okay to sit on the sidelines and wait for a good deal to come by; in short, you can't own all of your favorite companies and be guaranteed profits--and that is totally fine.\n* Take internet advice with a grain of salt. Even when using excellent investment sources such as Morningstar, form your own opinion given the facts. Don't blindly follow anybody. Also, please don't be a sucker for the \"must buy,\" \"top 10 best,\" or \"this stock is a sure thing\" language. Be immediately suspicious of this tone. If their ideas were so profitable, they wouldn't be sharing them with you. At some point you'll end up on Zacks, Seeking Alpha, or even r/stocks, and that's okay, but keep in mind that this is not gospel.\n* Make your investments worth something: don't buy $100 worth of shares in a company. It's not worth it. Your commission fees with end up being like $5/trade, meaning you'd need to make a 10% ROI just to break even. Even if you make a 25% ROI, you're still only taking home $15 before taxes! Bring a few thousand to the table at least, this is the only way to make it worth your time. Making x% is great, but if it's only a few bucks here and there, it's better just to save it and come back with some more substantial capital. Think about it, a minimum wage job in America will pay you on average \\~$10/hr, so in order to make the stock market worthwhile, bring thousands. Otherwise, hone your craft and *invest in your own self-improvement*, which will make more money in the end. At that point you'll be able to bring serious money to the table and start making worthwhile gains.\n* Speculation and investment are 2 totally different things; be honest with yourself and know when you're doing which. Checking and challenging yourself is so crucial before you buy. Internally debate yourself before you buy as a stress test. Play bear to your own bull, and if bull wins with your ego set aside, and everything else in that 1 sentence I said earlier applies, march into battle.\n* Always stay learning. Be hungry for more knowledge and open to hearing challenging opinions. Also, be willing to listen from the pros and others who know more than you. Surround yourself with smarter people and you will be greatly helped. Dudes on this forum saying \"I'm thinking about going all in on *this dogshit and/or overvalued company that I certainly do not understand but have convinced myself I do*\" are booby traps for speculators. Watch, listen, laugh, but listen to your gut.\n* Don't panic sell. If you see your investment decline by a few percent in a day, learn why, and understand that it's okay. Hold. Perhaps even buy more. All of this is in consideration that you followed the 1 sentence of advice earlier. Think about your investment decisions like home ownership. If you bought yourself a damn good house for $1,000,000 today, and somebody offered you $950,000 tomorrow for the same house, would you accept that offer? Fuck no. You bought a damn good house. Damn good houses don't lose 5% of their value in 24 hours unless the front porch is missing. That being said, be objective with what you hold--be honest with yourself when an investment simply isn't going according to plan and likely won't. It's okay to be wrong, but have a damn good reason to.\n\nThat's just my 2 cents. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!

I'm just trying to understand why and i definitely will try them with the demo-thing. Aren't pennystocks the same concept as normal stock? If you buy a large quantity and the stock rises you still make a profit right?\n\nAvoid penny stocks because they are worth pennies for a reason. The vast majority of these companies are highly speculative, unnecessarily risky, less-stable, prone to high volatility, far less liquid, and have comparatively limited information on hand to make an educated investment decision. Yes, they work just like other stocks, but don't be tricked into thinking that the only way to make sizable gains is by buying penny stocks. If you'd like, use your stock simulator to trade penny stocks (keep in mind, in real life, it will be harder to fill your orders due to low liquidity); you will eventually learn that you're speculating unnecessarily and will be making more consistent profits in the long term by investing in more established businesses.\n\n>Found a dude who has a youtube channel that i've been watching. But he does exactly that: speculating. And i don't understand how anyone could read the charts just from the shape of the up's and down's\n\nThe classic dude on YouTube staring at charts all day to speculate. Guys on YouTube blabbering on about all this technical analysis shit. You don't see Buffett, Munger, Graham, etc. spending their entire day starting at lines and graphs; of course, they do their research, but they are more focused on the companies themselves than their stock prices. This is what you must do. People often lose sight of the fact that they are buying shares of a company--don't treat these stocks like tickers and graphs; see them for what they really are.\n\n>While the founder of \"Billa\", which is a large supermarket chain in austria only got successful after 7 or so tries is get where you are coming from\n\nIndeed. I'm not saying you can't have 7 or even 70 ideas! What I'm trying to say here is don't just buy another stock because you feel like you have to own a different company for the sake of it. If you have 7 top-class investment ideas, and you couldn't drop a single one, run with it. Just make sure to stay core and get to the heart of the companies you can really make a case for. You don't need 7 Earth-shattering ideas to get rich. A handful will do.\n\n>And right now where there is such a rise in different social media apps and new startup companies you don't really know what to invest in.\n\nLike I said before, here is what you invest in: Don't *speculate*, but i*nvest* in shares of quality, financially strong, well-managed companies (treat them like *companies*, not stocks) with a clear competitive advantage at a fair (or even undervalued) price. It's a timeless strategy. Startups may disrupt, but if you invest in these great companies, they'll have decades of experience dealing with competition; that's why it's important to look for a clear competitive advantage. Additionally, startups don't always have the resources to hang with these moaty businesses. It is absolutely crucial that the companies you invest in have a real economic moat, or an element of their company that makes the uniquely competitive in their industry. \n\n>Can i DM you if i have anything else that i would like to know?

Ryanair employees in Germany are having a strike on Friday. would you sell stock to make a profit off of that?\n\nEdit: not an actual air strike. typo ", "parent_text": "Thank you for taking the time to type all that out and helping others!\nIf i have anything that i wanna know i'll be sure to ask you :)\n\n-Why not pennystocks exactly? I'm just trying to understand why and i definitely will try them with the demo-thing. Aren't pennystocks the same concept as normal stock? If you buy a large quantity and the stock rises you still make a profit right?\n\n-Day trading is why i actually got into trying out this whole thing. I always knew that it sounded too easy. Found a dude who has a youtube channel that i've been watching. But he does exactly that: speculating. And i don't understand how anyone could read the charts just from the shape of the up's and down's\n\n-just tried trading forex with a x20 leverage. I sold one and bought one. And of course the opposite happened. Is there a way or some sort of pattern that you can loosely stick to when a stock will rise or fall at a certain time of day?\n\n-While the founder of \"Billa\", which is a large supermarket chain in austria only got successful after 7 or so tries is get where you are coming from. I saw myself doing that, mostly because i was new to the whole thing and wanted to see which outcomes different actions have. If you don't want to try day-trading i can only see a handful of good companies over a long-term investment becoming profitable\n\n-You're right. I'm still under 30. It's gonna be a while until i'm confident enough to use my own money so i have time to actually watch several different stocks. One question to this subject: Do i have any restriction in stocks i am allowed to trade because i live in austria? I currently use plus500 and also downloaded thinkorswim today and am getting used to the UI. In Plus500 i don't have certain Stocks available to trade but in Thinkorswim i do. Is this due to the fact that P500 does not offer them or that they mainly cover the european market?\n\n-The thing with this is that you never know if a company will be as great as you currently think it is. Think of the people that bought Blockbuster shares ages ago. That didn't work out, right? :) And right now where there is such a rise in different social media apps and new startup companies you don't really know what to invest in.\n\n-I've heard everyone say this. So that is definitely what i'm gonna do.\n\n-What i've noticed is that at the moment i really try to analyze what could happen next. At least today i tried going through live news reports and tried buying and selling off that. But as the original post explains, that did not work out so good. Currently at -203 with the ryanair stock.\n\n-I am happy to say that i'd rather listen to someone who knows a decent amount about something than to think that i know everything without any experience so i got that going for me :)\n\n-And this is the worst thing i've noticed myself do. I don't even know how many times i said: shit, this is going down and then sold my shares and immediately bought to cover the losses. Which of course never worked. I'm really glad that these Demoaccounts exist.\n\nCan i DM you if i have anything else that i would like to know?
