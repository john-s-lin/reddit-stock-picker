We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales. Trading is currently halted. Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be.

Trading is currently halted. Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months.

I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales. Trading is currently halted. Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash.

While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_score": 230, "parent_ratio": 0.021739130434782608}, {"time": 1546470320.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed40fl4", "body": "Can someone explain why trading was halted?

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year.

I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_score": 230, "parent_ratio": 0.030434782608695653}, {"time": 1546473043.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed43wan", "body": "This should have been expected.

Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_score": 230, "parent_ratio": 0.008695652173913044}, {"time": 1546470102.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4054g", "body": "Who is NOT buying the \"dip\" tommorow?", "score": 5, "num_replies": 6, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.021739130434782608, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

Trading is currently halted. Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea.

We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.

While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months.

Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea.

Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond.

Trading is currently halted. Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year.

This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales. Trading is currently halted. Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond.

Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months.

As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_score": 230, "parent_ratio": 0.0}, {"time": 1546469544.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed3zebe", "body": "My Next shorts are Tesla and Boeing.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years.

As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Unreal, hours after I buy 100 shares.", "parent_score": 246, "parent_ratio": 0.23170731707317074}, {"time": 1546487618.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4lda8", "body": "Dollar cost averaging maaaaaan!!

And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services.

One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac.

Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Unreal, hours after I buy 100 shares.", "parent_score": 246, "parent_ratio": -0.11788617886178862}, {"time": 1546476552.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed48a16", "body": "\"Google seems to finally have figured out that people want OS upgrades and no vendor customizations and released Android One\" \n\nThis is called Android FRAGMENTATION and Google hates it but can't fix it because everybody is allowed manufacture an Android with any hardware they want.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results.

In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "We already knew all this?

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business.

Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "its going to be interesting to see if Buffet is buying at these levels or if he is selling or if he already sold.

Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Forgive me because I\u2019m extremely new to the stock market, but couldn\u2019t a low quarter/going cash neutral be ultimately beneficial to shareholders?

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Steve Jobs would have never allowed iPhone Xs, Xs Max, Xr, models.

We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Steve Jobs would have never allowed iPhone Xs, Xs Max, Xr, models.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Apple isn't going anywhere and this'll likely be some buying opportunities, but what's the next innovation?

In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "I was up $800 on the day.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Can someone explain why trading was halted?

We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Who is NOT buying the \"dip\" tommorow?", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 2.2}, {"time": 1546472400.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed43349", "body": "Dip?

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world.

Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Who is NOT buying the \"dip\" tommorow?", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.2}, {"time": 1546484079.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4hcbx", "body": "Icahn sold at $95/share.", "score": 15, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.06521739130434782, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Hello reddit,\n\nI tried to warn you not to buy today.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/abqw4h/apple\\_in\\_serious\\_trouble/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/abqw4h/apple_in_serious_trouble/)\n\nBut of course, I was mocked because my argument goes against the group think here.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months.

And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac.

We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "ouch, sorry to hear that.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac.

As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business.

We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "This! It's just pure rip-off.

Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Bufffet probably already sold.

And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "I would love for Apple to do package deals like that.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services.

This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Agree ... still not sure if the XR or the XS is the cheap model.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now.

Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond.

We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "AR glasses & autonomous car system. 2020-2023.", "parent_score": 5, "parent_ratio": 0.2}, {"time": 1546527216.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed5i6qr", "body": "The issue is, I could see this selling off even harder once earnings come out at the end of the month, unless they somehow beat the extremely low bar they've set.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "55 billion gone in a day my friend \ud83e\udd74 what would you do?

And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Icahn sold at $95/share.", "parent_score": 15, "parent_ratio": 0.13333333333333333}, {"time": 1546484217.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4higc", "body": "good for you if you called the top at 220", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.013043478260869565, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "I disagree on Tesla.

While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Alternatively, buy a put or 2.", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 0.3333333333333333}, {"time": 1546558449.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed6pe2j", "body": "I'm not selling til Warren does.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.

Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 23, "parent_ratio": 0.043478260869565216}, {"time": 1546492693.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4qtz5", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "num_replies": 2, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.0391304347826087, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "That's also true, but I think Tim Cook is also (and obviously) downplaying the failure of their management to foresee how bad of an idea continually raising prices was in the midst of competition equalizing.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Seems like you have a personal issue with the guy", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.5714285714285714}, {"time": 1546498501.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4vte8", "body": "So did mine back in 06", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.008695652173913044, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services.

This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "price could drop below 130 tomorrow, imo", "parent_score": 4, "parent_ratio": 1.25}, {"time": 1546473415.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed44dd0", "body": "lol I find that hard to believe.", "score": 0, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.0, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results.

In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "You must be kidding.", "parent_score": -9, "parent_ratio": -0.4444444444444444}, {"time": 1546479601.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4byoj", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.02608695652173913, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 9, "parent_ratio": -0.1111111111111111}, {"time": 1546484036.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4hafl", "body": "But recycling is of zero cost to you if your community already supports it, so that\u2019s not the same at all.", "score": 10, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 230, "submission_ratio": 0.043478260869565216, "submission_title": "Apple revises Q1 Guidance, sighting lower iPhone sales.

In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "But Buffett was yelling for years how the rich don't pay enough taxes, how his secretary pays a higher rate than he does, and how he wants to pay more.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond.

The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 6, "parent_ratio": 0.16666666666666666}, {"time": 1546498834.0, "submission_id": "aby4q2", "comment_id": "ed4w2md", "body": "I was honestly just impressed with Fi when I was travelling this fall.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed.

Trading is currently halted.", "submission_text": "Tim Cook just posted the following message to shareholders:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\n\nTo Apple investors:\n\n\nToday we are revising our guidance for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2019 first quarter, which ended on December 29. We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance. I\u2019d like to go a bit deeper on both. \n\n\n**Emerging Market Challenges**\n\nWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China. In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "Google was demoing self driving cars in 2009.

In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad.\n\n\nChina\u2019s economy began to slow in the second half of 2018. The government-reported GDP growth during the September quarter was the second lowest in the last 25 years. We believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States. As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed. And market data has shown that the contraction in Greater China\u2019s smartphone market has been particularly sharp.\nDespite these challenges, we believe that our business in China has a bright future. The iOS developer community in China is among the most innovative, creative and vibrant in the world. Our products enjoy a strong following among customers, with a very high level of engagement and satisfaction. Our results in China include a new record for Services revenue, and our installed base of devices grew over the last year. We are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace.\n\n\n**iPhone**\n\nLower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year. \n\n\nWhile Greater China and other emerging markets accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year iPhone revenue decline, in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. While macroeconomic challenges in some markets were a key contributor to this trend, we believe there are other factors broadly impacting our iPhone performance, including consumers adapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies, US dollar strength-related price increases, and some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements. \n\n\n**Many Positive Results in the December Quarter**\n\nWhile it\u2019s disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges. \nOur installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high\u2014growing by more than 100 million units in 12 months. There are more Apple devices being used than ever before, and it\u2019s a testament to the ongoing loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. \n\n\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, revenue outside of our iPhone business grew by almost 19 percent year-over-year, including all-time record revenue from Services, Wearables and Mac. Our non-iPhone businesses have less exposure to emerging markets, and the vast majority of Services revenue is related to the size of the installed base, not current period sales. \n\n\nServices generated over $10.8 billion in revenue during the quarter, growing to a new quarterly record in every geographic segment, and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the size of this business from 2016 to 2020.\nWearables grew by almost 50 percent year-over-year, as Apple Watch and AirPods were wildly popular among holiday shoppers; launches of MacBook Air and Mac mini powered the Mac to year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of the new iPad Pro drove iPad to year-over-year double-digit revenue growth. \nWe also expect to set all-time revenue records in several developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. And, while we saw challenges in some emerging markets, others set records, including Mexico, Poland, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nFinally, we also expect to report a new all-time record for Apple\u2019s earnings per share.\n\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nOur profitability and cash flow generation are strong, and we expect to exit the quarter with approximately $130 billion in net cash. As we have stated before, we plan to become net-cash neutral over time.\n\n\nAs we exit a challenging quarter, we are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business. We manage Apple for the long term, and Apple has always used periods of adversity to re-examine our approach, to take advantage of our culture of flexibility, adaptability and creativity, and to emerge better as a result. \nMost importantly, we are confident and excited about our pipeline of future products and services. Apple innovates like no other company on earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas.\nWe can\u2019t change macroeconomic conditions, but we are undertaking and accelerating other initiatives to improve our results. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in a phone in our stores, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the current to the new phone. This is not only great for the environment, it is great for the customer, as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it is great for developers, as it can help grow our installed base. \nThis is one of a number of steps we are taking to respond. We can make these adjustments because Apple\u2019s strength is in our resilience, the talent and creativity of our team, and the deeply held passion for the work we do every day.\nExpectations are high for Apple because they should be. We are committed to exceeding those expectations every day.\n\n\nThat has always been the Apple way, and it always will be.\n\n\nTim", "parent_text": "If you think self driving cars are the totality of artificial intelligence then I\u2019m not surprised you don\u2019t understand the number of ways you interact with AI on a probably daily basis at this point and the extent to which advancement in the field is exceeding the expectations that AI professional would have forecasted over the timeframe you\u2019re referring to.\n\nThey also have a lot to show for it, the fact that the average road vehicle isn\u2019t self driving doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t advancing what could be considered one of the loftiest goals in human history.

We now expect the following:\n\n\nRevenue of approximately $84 billion\nGross margin of approximately 38 percent\nOperating expenses of approximately $8.7 billion\nOther income/(expense) of approximately $550 million\nTax rate of approximately 16.5 percent before discrete items\n\n\nWe expect the number of shares used in computing diluted EPS to be approximately 4.77 billion.\n\n\nBased on these estimates, our revenue will be lower than our original guidance for the quarter, with other items remaining broadly in line with our guidance. \n\n\nWhile it will be a number of weeks before we complete and report our final results, we wanted to get some preliminary information to you now. Our final results may differ somewhat from these preliminary estimates. \n\n\nWhen we discussed our Q1 guidance with you about 60 days ago, we knew the first quarter would be impacted by both macroeconomic and Apple-specific factors. Based on our best estimates of how these would play out, we predicted that we would report slight revenue growth year-over-year for the quarter. As you may recall, we discussed four factors:\n\n\nFirst, we knew the different timing of our iPhone launches would affect our year-over-year compares. Our top models, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, shipped in Q4\u201918\u2014placing the channel fill and early sales in that quarter, whereas last year iPhone X shipped in Q1\u201918, placing the channel fill and early sales in the December quarter. We knew this would create a difficult compare for Q1\u201919, and this played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nSecond, we knew the strong US dollar would create foreign exchange headwinds and forecasted this would reduce our revenue growth by about 200 basis points as compared to the previous year. This also played out broadly in line with our expectations.\n\n\nThird, we knew we had an unprecedented number of new products to ramp during the quarter and predicted that supply constraints would gate our sales of certain products during Q1. \n\n\nAgain, this also played out broadly in line with our expectations. Sales of Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro were constrained much or all of the quarter. AirPods and MacBook Air were also constrained.\nFourth, we expected economic weakness in some emerging markets. This turned out to have a significantly greater impact than we had projected. \n\n\nIn addition, these and other factors resulted in fewer iPhone upgrades than we had anticipated. \n\n\nThese last two points have led us to reduce our revenue guidance.

You're betting that Apple or whatever will fall and you re-purchase stocks from the market at 115/ share to put back in his account and pocket the profits of 30/ share, thus making money as companies tank instead of making it as they profit. Bob never is any the wiser.\n\nNow, the pitfall is you decide to short Apple and buy Bob's shares at 145/ share. Except, tomorrow Apple announces the Apple XXX with more pixels than ever and twelve cameras and mood lighting for even better selfies and it's the greatest thing ever. Their shares jump to 290/ share overnight. Bob, being a smart man, sees the bubble and sells. Vanguard calls you up and you have to cover that 290/ share purchase from the market to repay those shares you bought so he can sell. That means you just lost 145/ share.\n\nI mean, that's the basics.\n\nHave to do it before the market moves. It's high stakes betting with money you may or may not have.
