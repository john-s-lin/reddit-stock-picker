I find it hard to believe the Fed and the rest of government was unaware of institutions that were making loans based on income that was not verified, otherwise known as stated income.\n\nI studied macroeconomics in college but I'm not an economist or hold an advanced degree but I listen to what companies say and keep up on things that have an effect on people. I realized in May of '07 when people who were making substantially more income than 3 years earlier and had a house that had greatly increased in value having to settle for another 3 year ARM and denied a fixed rate loan. I knew that meant banks were in trouble but I didn't know when it would get critical. Going into '08 after the market peak in Oct. I started to lighten up and by July, i was virtually out of the market. Meantime, despite the events and  collapse of several financial firms, the Fed seemed blissfully unaware along with the rest of the government.\n\nCould a systemic crisis catch us unaware in the future?

Or do you think that the people who buy apple products will stop buying them and go for samsung instead?\n\n1. Better display, is hard to argue for. In what sense? Because it has a better pixel count? I think that both phones have pretty damn good screens to look at. Apple played a marketing trick long time ago, when they switched to those \"retina\" screens, but the effect of screen upgrades is not that visible anymore.\n2. Expandable storage. What a joke, Apple would never want to have a microSD card in their phones and apple users would never want to use one. This is 2018, those things are done for, it's just that manufacturers like Samsung keep them around so they can say \"hey our phone has expandable storage, boo apple\". Who cares if it's slow af. And who cares that cloud has made this deprecated. Cloud is where the future is for expandable storage.\n3. Same as above, deprecated technology. Wireless headphones are the future. That said, Apple doesn't provide them for free which is a shitty move from them (but not a surprising one).\n4,5. bigger, stronger, bla bla, the question is how it works in practice. An iPhone user doesn't care if his phone has 4gb of ram or 16. He does care if his phone has imessages though.\n\nAll of these were true a few years ago, they are true of Macs, yet Apple is still around. Their consumers don't care about these and those who do compromise.\nSpeaking for me, as a \"loyal\" Apple user, what annoys me more is the milking that's has intensified even more the past 1-2 years with increased prices over everything, from phones to cases and apple care.\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 0.6666666666666666, "submission_title": "After reading through Apple's Q4 transcript here's what i think about the reaction by analysts", "submission_text": "The obsession over this change is a blatant attempt to cool the stock off and lower the price of a company that is executing at the highest level and will  probably replace FANG as the stock that can cover up a shitty portfolio with its gains.

All the media reports talk about unit sales, which mean very little compared to more important metrics like revenue, profit, services, and user base.\n\nApple is obviously pushing the narrative that they are a services company that sells hardware.  So of course they will present information that focuses on services growth and install base growth.\n\nUnit sales are an obsolete metric for Apple at this point.  Much more important is install base and how much each user spends on services.  Its the razor and razor blade theory.  Less important is how many razors they sell (iPhones) which is a 1 time transaction.
