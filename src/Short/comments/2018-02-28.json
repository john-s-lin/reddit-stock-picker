In your example, the 10 shares vest at $20 each, so you have an extra $200 of income that month. This will be reflected on your paystub from your employer, and will appear on your W2 at the end of the year.\n\nBecause it is income, you owe income tax *regardless of whether you decide to sell at this time*. Your employer is required to withhold a portion of the RSU income to remit to the IRS, the same as they do with any other income. You'll need to decide how to pay that withholding. Whichever broker is handling your RSUs on behalf of your employer will require you to make a \"tax election\". There are 3 options:\n\n* **Sell all shares immediately upon vest**. The shares are sold for $200. Income tax is withheld--say, 30% for federal and 8% for state, for a total of 38% or $76. You receive $124, probably by direct deposit to your bank account.\n\n* **Sell to cover**. 4 shares are automatically sold for a total of $80, of which $76 is withheld for income tax. You receive the remaining $4 as a direct deposit. You now own 6 shares of your company's stock, and they are treated from now on exactly as if you had purchased those shares for $20 each on the date of vesting. I won't go into the details here, but that means when you sell those 6 shares, if the price has gone up above your $20 cost basis you will owe capital gains tax; and the amount of the tax will depend on whether you own the shares for less or more than 1 year after the vest date. Because $20 is your cost basis, you do not pay capital gains taxes based on the first $20 of the stock's value, since you already paid your income tax on that portion.\n\n* **Retain all shares**. Your RSU broker will require you to pay $76 in cash to cover your employer's income tax withholding obligation. This rarely makes sense; if you really want to own more of your employer's stock, you could just use sell-to-cover, retain 6 shares, and buy another 4 shares for $20 each on the open market--or even better, wait for an opportune time and buy those 4 shares for $15 each rather than being forced to buy them on the specific date when your shares are vesting.\n\nFor all of this, think carefully about the risks involved with depending on a single company for your current paycheck, your long-term career, *and* a significant part of your savings/investments.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 15, "submission_ratio": 0.13333333333333333, "submission_title": "Stock Tax Question", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1519830733.0, "submission_id": "80wobf", "comment_id": "duyo6d2", "body": "You need to keep in mind that $NFLX has a huge market share in the video streaming industry.

Playing earnings is a big gamble, as you've experienced yourself first hand. Aside from knowing a company's financial situation inside and out, you have to forecast their predicted earnings and guidance correctly. Ontop of which, you have to decide whether or not the SP has already been priced in. This is where technical analysis comes in handy to identify these scenarios. Not to mention general market trends, like the SP500 recently taking a fat dump, which is more than likely why you don't see bull momentum in HD. The correlation is too high. This is not to say that this is the only reason. Other factors might be HD's guidance being lowered, etc (I have not looked at HDs report, this is an example, idk if they raised their guidance).\n\nSee how many factors there are? Since you're just starting out, there are too many moving parts, too many factors, too many decisions, that you'll just end up getting burnt.\n\nMy advice to you:\n\n1. Avoid holding through earnings until you're A LOT better\n\n2. Observe, at a minimum, the general trend of DJI, and SP500 to get a feel of how your ticker will move and to analyze any correlation between them.\n\n3. Follow the news, even if it's just a quick 5-10 minutes to read the headlines each day.\n\n4. Since you've identified yourself as a trader and not an investor, I'd suggest learning the charts on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/) a bit more and then playing around with a paper account first. Now's a good time since the global market is in a very volatile state, which means a lot of good money can be lost/made, not the best environment for someone just starting out.\n\n5. Probably what you've been looking for in this long drawn out answer. If you have no need for this money in the near future, I'd hold. Why? SP500 entered a 10% correction, and HD followed. It's unlikely that this is the start of a bear market, simply because it happened too fast too soon. Usually a bear market starts after a period of consolidation/market plateau, and since that never happened, we should see the SP500 recover to it's former glory (most of it anyways). How long this will take, only time will tell. All you need to know is when the SP500 recovers, so should HD.\n\nYes, it's true there's opportunity costs out there, but IMO, as someone starting out, you have a higher risk of losing even more money as the SP500 consolidates, which is why I would suggest holding. As an investment, HD is a pretty solid company, and I don't see your $ disappearing regardless.\n\n\n(Last thing, from what I understand a lot of professional traders don't trade earnings.

Which isn't much btw.", "parent_text": "Playing earnings (buying before the report, and holding through it) is extremely risky. Playing earnings is a big gamble, as you've experienced yourself first hand. Aside from knowing a company's financial situation inside and out, you have to forecast their predicted earnings and guidance correctly. Ontop of which, you have to decide whether or not the SP has already been priced in. This is where technical analysis comes in handy to identify these scenarios. Not to mention general market trends, like the SP500 recently taking a fat dump, which is more than likely why you don't see bull momentum in HD. The correlation is too high. This is not to say that this is the only reason. Other factors might be HD's guidance being lowered, etc (I have not looked at HDs report, this is an example, idk if they raised their guidance).\n\nSee how many factors there are? Since you're just starting out, there are too many moving parts, too many factors, too many decisions, that you'll just end up getting burnt.\n\nMy advice to you:\n\n1. Avoid holding through earnings until you're A LOT better\n\n2. Observe, at a minimum, the general trend of DJI, and SP500 to get a feel of how your ticker will move and to analyze any correlation between them.\n\n3. Follow the news, even if it's just a quick 5-10 minutes to read the headlines each day.\n\n4. Since you've identified yourself as a trader and not an investor, I'd suggest learning the charts on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/university/technical/) a bit more and then playing around with a paper account first. Now's a good time since the global market is in a very volatile state, which means a lot of good money can be lost/made, not the best environment for someone just starting out.\n\n5. Probably what you've been looking for in this long drawn out answer. If you have no need for this money in the near future, I'd hold. Why? SP500 entered a 10% correction, and HD followed. It's unlikely that this is the start of a bear market, simply because it happened too fast too soon. Usually a bear market starts after a period of consolidation/market plateau, and since that never happened, we should see the SP500 recover to it's former glory (most of it anyways). How long this will take, only time will tell. All you need to know is when the SP500 recovers, so should HD.\n\nYes, it's true there's opportunity costs out there, but IMO, as someone starting out, you have a higher risk of losing even more money as the SP500 consolidates, which is why I would suggest holding. As an investment, HD is a pretty solid company, and I don't see your $ disappearing regardless.\n\n\n(Last thing, from what I understand a lot of professional traders don't trade earnings.
