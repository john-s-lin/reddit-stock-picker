If so, you can treat it and your 401k as part of the same thing for diversification purposes. If you have good domestic choices in your 401k but poor international choices, maybe use this account to hold some international funds with low expenses.   Otherwise, if you want to treat them seperately and want great 1 fund diversification, a Target Retirement fund will get you US/International stocks and bonds. You can find those pretty easy.  For the rest of the post I'll assume you just want a US stock index fund (just as an example)\n\nUse this screener to look around.\n\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/fund-screener/\n\nLook at funds with no transaction fee, low expense ratios, and a minimum investment of 2500 or less. \n\nSorting by Assets under management (to see the biggest funds), I found this total market fund:  \nFSTMX - Fidelity\u00ae Total Market Index Fund - Investor Class  \nhttps://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911404  \nThis will track the total US market. Expense ratio here is 0.09%, pretty good, Once you have 10k you can get premium share class for lower expense ratios.  \n\nIf you go the ETF route, the expense ratios are lower. You can google around the differences between ETFs/Mutual funds, but don't sweat it too much. As I mentioned earlier, auto investments aren't a thing with ETFs. There are no minimum investments, but you have to buy whole shares. The options are comparable. Fidelity also offers zero commision iShares funds, which are large popular funds (not that it really matters, almost all \"Total US Market Index Fund\"s are going to be near identical). \n\nhttps://research2.fidelity.com/pi/etf-screener  \nWorks just like the other screener.   \nHere's a total market ETF with $0 comission: \nISHARES CORE S&P TOTAL US STOCK MARKET (ITOT)  \nhttps://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=ITOT  \n", "parent_score": 3, "parent_ratio": 0.3333333333333333}, {"time": 1514857811.0, "submission_id": "7nj5z4", "comment_id": "ds27cps", "body": "Should I just create an account with someone else (Thats a bit easier to invest with smaller amounts) before starting?
