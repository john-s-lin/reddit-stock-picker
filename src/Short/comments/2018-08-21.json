Three of the top  global social/communication media platforms today are owned by Facebook. FB, Instagram and Whatsapp. And with things like Instragram TV & monotizing whats app.. both of these are no joke and should be a major bullish catalyst. With whatsapp, a simple flip of the switch and billions of dollars are added to Facebook's revenue. Things like this make it hard for me to say FB will go negative in the long term.\n\nSo when you are a start up and some one offers you billions of dollars(when you are multi million at best).... Unless your competition is offering better deals, chances are very high you would take it... Very rare for the new guys to believe they can do better. Especially when Facebook has the power, the influence, the following, the money and even the ability to just copy your idea otherwise (Snapchat being beaten down by Instagram by FB just copying their formula with stories and such... you know that company that zuckerberg tried to acquire them 4 years ago but refused like you think success stories would... Now do you think facebook has any reason to buy them now that they just \"took\" the ideas? THey are beating snapchat at their own game! The same logic was always uttered by linux & apple guys regarding microsofts domination in the PC market.  That Microsoft wont last and the future generations will all use Linux. However the opposite is true and it has only gotten bigger.  In the server world, as big/secure/better(potentially) Linux is... the vast majority still opt for Microsoft and with their new cloud services its only going to get worst. Another example is Google's G suite... it came out 6 years before Microsoft started competition with its own cloud office/email suite with office 365. Guess what? Microsoft owns 90% of that market today, why because like Facebook with social media... they held a monopoly on the email/office suite industry and for them to flip the switch and integrate unoriginal ideas with no problem. Microsoft wont succeed against google in the search business... and google wont succeed in the race for office/email business (enterprise at least, gmail is very popular). Just like google didn't succeed in its attempt to make its own Facebook. Never sell these monopolies of specific tech specialization short in the tech industry. Their monopolization is only growing stronger and stronger.  They evolve like no other industry because of how easy it is to change the whole business (change the code and it will change the product the customer already have at an instant... this is the power of software)\n\nYour example of all those old corporations are exactly that. Old Companies that dont evolve. They followed the old model of keeping things as they are. Every tech company that did this fell apart or went in the negative. Microsoft, Facebook, Apple,  Amazon, etc dont follow this route and shouldn't be considered as the 2018's version of MySpace. These guys have no problem buying or taking ideas and implementing them. Amazon starting its own Netflix/\\\\Spotify service when nothing in their business relates back to it. Especially with the kind of competition they will have now. Apple more recently realized they need to expand heavily in the software business and not rely on their hardware alone. I could go on and on. But you get the idea. Facebook does and will continue to do the same unless we see otherwise.\n\nI am interested to see how Facebook competes with MTCH with its newly dating platform in development... considering the sheer amount of users FB/IG already have to add a feature for dating. Plenty of people already use IG for meeting people/trying to hook up. I think it hits close enough to home for it (social media goliath adds another social media platform). They wont have a hard time advertising at all.

Keep in mind that this is not advice, and I am just some rando on the internet. Very brief, but multifactorial reasons:\n\n* We have entered the \"euphoria\" stage of the cycle - indices are at all-time highs again, we've been in a true bull market for probably the longest time in history, consumer confidence is high (though recently below projections)  \n* Increased utilization of leverage in the market. This has been directly or indirectly responsible for virtually every major total market decline in history, and this is what ruins people's lives when it happens (say, if they have variable rate loans/mortgages or lose almost the entire value of their investment portfolio)  \n* Regardless of your political affiliation, it should be evident that if Democrats retake the house/senate the hammer will come closer to dropping on Trump. Either directly through injunctions/potential impeachment proceedings, or indirectly by continually feeding off of negative press to fuel them into 2020 elections. I have no dog in this fight, I am a registered independent in an open caucus state and for the sake of full disclosure, I lean moderately left on most issues.  \n* Narrowing of the yield curve. We haven't yet reached inversion so there is likely still a good amount of time for a truly major crash to occur, but this is one of the most accurate indicators of upcoming market troubles  \n* Another tech bubble. Similar to #2, when it seems like every dotcom and startup is getting money shoved in their face left and right when their core business models/plans are absolute shite, a greater proportion of ventures will be unsuccessful. I wouldn't expect anything as severe as the dotcom bubble in early 2000s because much of the silicon valley/finance relationship was still very much in its infancy at the time and many investors are experienced enough to remember this (though it was almost two decades ago now... some younger investors may not have yet learned the lessons from that crash)  \n* Rising federal funds rate. It's been artificially kept low for a very long time now, rising inflation/CPI substantially. We're approaching the point where the Fed will keep slowly increasing the fed funds rate, which will directly discourage investments (despite whatever Trump tweets about keeping fed funds rate low - it's not within his discretion to do so, to my knowledge)\n\nPersonally, I'm not calling doomsday and still have much of my savings capital invested in the market because I'm young and very risk-tolerant and also because many total stock market indicators have *not* reached a disconcerting level yet, but I am not leveraging my investments and have a substantial cash balance. I plan to dump that cash balance and leverage my investments once the next crash occurs. Specifically, I'll wait and see whether the midterms lean towards Democrats retaking the house/senate (they are currently favored at least in the House of Representatives according to 538, though this is no guarantee and we are still several months away) before adjusting how much exposure to the market I have.\n\nEdit: I noticed votes on this particular comment have been very controversial so far, and have wavered between +5 and -5.
