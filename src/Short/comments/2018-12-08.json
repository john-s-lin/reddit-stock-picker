The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!\n\n*****\n\nHave a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!", "parent_text": "Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018! Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n> The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect.

Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

The S&P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n> As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n> There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n> Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n> The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n> Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n> The S&P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n> \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n> The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n> \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n> \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n> Redler said he expects the S&P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n> In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n> Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n> On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n> In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n> Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n> Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n> Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n> 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n> Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n> Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n> These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$ADBE** \n> * **$AEO** \n> * **$SFIX** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$DSW** \n> * **$PLAY** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$PVTL** \n> * **$ASNA** \n> * **$INSE** \n> * **$FRAN** \n> * **$GTIM** \n> * **$CDMO** \n> * **$ASPU** \n> * **$ARWR** \n> * **$DLHC** \n> * **$CASY** \n> * **$PLAB** \n> * **$VRA** \n> * **$NCS**\n> * **$NX** \n> * **$TLRD** \n> * **$SEAC** \n> * **$ROAD** \n> * **$CHKE** \n> * **$IRET** \n> * **$OXM** \n> * **$NDSN** \n> * **$FTI** \n> * **$VERU** \n> * **$PHX** \n> * **$CIVI** \n> * **$SKIS** \n> * **$SMMT** \n> * **$PURE** \n> * **$STRM** \n> * **$MMMB** \n> * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n> **Adobe Systems, Inc.

While Google and Facebook still hold dominant positions, Amazon's advertising business is growing rapidly enough to cause concern. Given Google's lack of diversification, that's more than a bit of an issue.\n\n2. Culturally Google has had a number of issues over the last couple of years. While people may not regard this as material, I think it's concerning including recent walkouts.\n\n3. A number of the \"other bets\" have been somewhat disappointing, including Google Fiber. Verily has had disappointments (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/google-s-health-moonshot-comes-back-to-earth), as well. I don't think Nest has lived up to expectations. Some neat other projects that weren't part of the other bets (Project Ara) were given up on. Boston Dynamics - the robots whose demonstration videos go viral every time one is put out - was sold to Softbank. Even look at something like the Pixel phones, which have gotten good reviews (as did the Google Nexus phones line previously), but I don't think that Google has put enough of an effort behind either line of phones to get any sort of material market share.\n\n4. Google has to push towards diversifying the business over the next 5-10 years. Waymo has to work. I think there's a lot of pressure on Waymo to become a significant business in regards to Google's need to become a more diverse business in the coming years and move away from becoming so reliant upon ad revenue.\n\n5.

The truth if their dragging their feet as long as they can on EVs because the transition itself will most likely bankrupt them.  \n\nThey have substantial sunk costs already made in the factories that produce ICE cars.  These costs are amortized over 20 years and on top of having to produce new assembly\u2019s plants their engine factories will become outdated and non profitable. \n\nThey don\u2019t understand battery technology as well as Tesla.

This quarter I expect that the margin numbers to improve even more.  The cap and trade credits are available to everyone and  are  not going away.  When I hear critics mention them I have one question.  What do you expect Tesla to do with their credits if not cash them in? They\u2019re not producing ice cars so they have no need to keep them. They will continue to sell these until we\u2019re in a place where humans don\u2019t need to lower their C02 consumption.\n\nThe comparison to go pro is interesting however the one downfall of go pro is that they relied on one product,  Tesla has a very extensive roadmap, they will be doubling revenue every year and a half for the next 10 years at least if they bring all their planned products to market.  Have you looked at the year over year sales of BMWs or Diamler recently?  Things are not looking good. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious about the autpilot tech you mentioned on Mercedes cars.

Meaning if there is less demand, they simply produce less. They are also vertically integrated for repairs, warranty, charging stations. The bulk of profit made from dealership is maintenance. Tesla will be eating up that profit.\n\n2) Just look at I-Pace coming to U.S. in late 2019, the car was suppose to have 300+ range comparable to Tesla. As it turn out, that range is 234 miles in EPA standards while Model 3 is at 310 range. You might see 234 range as enough, but is it really? Tesla's 310 range gets a 70% reduced range when temperature drop below 10 degree. Imagine i-Pace range dropping 70% on an already reduced range. None of the car including VW coming out with good range for 2019. Range is extremely important especially for EVs. None of them also built charging stations across America as comprehensive as Tesla even though Tesla's charging stations are not that comprehensive at all.\n\n3) While true that REAL competition is coming out in 2020/2021, but Tesla roadster is set to have 600+ miles range by then with their new battery technology. So, sure that competition will be out, but by then Tesla already have a head start.\n\n4) Software is HARD. There is a reason why phone only has iOS, Android, and Windows. Dont think for a second that building an AI will be a piece of cake. There is a reason why silicon valley is the center of software tech because it requires a lot of man power and ingenuity. This is not something you can just whip up or piece together. That requires tons of innovations. That's also be frank here, when was the last time tech really innovated in a traditional car? They are still clunky and slow. Tesla's center console feels as buttery smooth as your iPhone. I highly doubt that GM or Ford can manage to create great software at all. While GM was planning to launch super cruise in Cadillac CT6 2019, that dream had ended. [https://jalopnik.com/dead-the-cadillac-ct6-and-a-ton-of-other-gm-cars-1830656192](https://jalopnik.com/dead-the-cadillac-ct6-and-a-ton-of-other-gm-cars-1830656192)\n\n5) Innovations. Simple as that. Taking boring company for instance. Elon musk is combining research from SpaceX rocket tech to improve the speed of the drill and battery tech from Tesla to prevent mono-dioxide building up in tunnels. Traditional boring gas machine will output tons of mono-dioxide in a close space tunnel where as battery wont. SpaceX is also launching thousands of near earth satellites for superior connectivity. That also allows Tesla cars to be connected anywhere in the world to utilize superior cloud services for huge number of applications like real time traffic monitoring to allow self driving AI to automatically reroute, major complimentary computation from cloud to boost Tesla's AI chip. Not to mention, NASA is sharing innovation with spaceX which can be applied to Tesla and that includes AI. \n\nThe list goes on and on. Let's say by some miracle that one company can solve all these monumental issues from battery to AI and outpaced Tesla's innovations. Tesla having just 10% of the overall global car market is already gigantic. Not to mention, Tesla is also planning to compete against Uber. They are also building massive Gigabyte worth of batteries. Then, dont forget solar roof. Finally, merging boring company with Tesla or even acquiring neurolink which are all Elon Musk's companies. \n\n&#x200B;", "score": 7, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 163, "submission_ratio": 0.04294478527607362, "submission_title": "TSLA has been on a tear", "submission_text": "It was 3% off of its all time high early Friday with Jeffries giving them a $450 price tag.   2019 will be the year the shorts finally get destroyed ", "parent_text": "It's possible that high end manufacturers will eat into demand for high end EV just as Tesla ramps up.

The truth if their dragging their feet as long as they can on EVs because the transition itself will most likely bankrupt them.\n\nThat is just not true. BMW for example released their i3 in 2013 and sold 93,000 in total until 2017.  The i3 is quite expensive, but it is also not made in huge numbers, so they don\u00b4t have economy of scale yet. This will change if every single car manufacturer is building a large portion of their cars as EVs. The transition is not difficult. Not from a financial standpoint and also not from a technoloigical standpoint. Car production lines are extremley dedicated to one model. Those models never run longer than 8 years, so after that time, the prodction lines have to be swapped out anyway. EVs are not difficult to build either. The technology is extremely simple. Extremly simple! The only issue so far was that the batteries could not be made cheap enough. This will change!\n\n>They don\u2019t understand battery technology as well as Tesla. Sure they can LG produce the batteries but without engineers that understand batteries their cars will never be fully optimized for performance and longevity. Look at the battery degregation of the leaf, it\u2019s atrocious.\n\nTesla is using Panasonic batteries. They don\u00b4t have their own technology. Any other car manufacturer can start a partnetship with Panasonic too. There is also Samsung and LG Chem as well as CATL and BYD. All of them are esentially building the same thing. Even Teslas grid storage battery in Australia was built by Samsung. Surely Tesla would have used their own if they could make so many of them and if they were so great?\n\n>I don\u2019t know what you mean by their profits came from one time subsidies which aren\u2019t sustainable? https://www.businessinsider.de/tesla-and-gms-tax-incentives-are-about-to-run-out-2018-6?r=US&IR=T\n\"Once a manufacturer hits the 200,000 EV mark, they\u2019ll finish that quarter and will go one more quarter beyond at the $7,500 incentive level. A phase-out period begins with incentives cut in half at $3,750 for the next six months; it then goes down to $1,875 for the next six months before it goes away entirely.\" \n\n>Their gross profits were over 20% on all their vehicles and that\u2019s while their model 3 lines are ramping and not fully efficient.  \n\nThis is because Tesla calculates their gross margin completely different than all other manufacturers. They exclude the costs for R&D, services costs and warranty costs. See it this way: Does it make sense that a brand new car manufacturer with a new technology, operating out of a tent is more efficient than all other car manufacturers? Even more efficient than the Germans? \n\n>I\u2019m curious about the autpilot tech you mentioned on Mercedes cars. I did a quick google search and haven\u2019t found anything.

It steers the car on most roads, not just the highway. It doest emergency braking, lane changes, it keeps the distance to other cars, it helps you steer in corners. It also parks the car with you inside, or outside of the car. So you can park in tight spots where you cannot open the doors anymore. It works. The only difference I see is that in the Mercedes you have to touch the steering wheel every 15 secods, whereas the Tesla allows you to take them off for 60 seconds. Google and Nvidia are also developint self driving cars which are thought to be already far superior than Teslas AP. \n", "score": 0, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 163, "submission_ratio": 0.0, "submission_title": "TSLA has been on a tear", "submission_text": "It was 3% off of its all time high early Friday with Jeffries giving them a $450 price tag.   2019 will be the year the shorts finally get destroyed ", "parent_text": "None of the other OEMs have demonstrated that they\u2019re able to build any type of EVs on scale at all.  Even the concepts they put out aren\u2019t comparable in performance to the Tesla\u2019s Gen 2 vehicles (model S and X) and those are 6 years old already.  The truth if their dragging their feet as long as they can on EVs because the transition itself will most likely bankrupt them.  \n\nThey have substantial sunk costs already made in the factories that produce ICE cars.  These costs are amortized over 20 years and on top of having to produce new assembly\u2019s plants their engine factories will become outdated and non profitable. \n\nThey don\u2019t understand battery technology as well as Tesla. Sure they can LG produce the batteries but without engineers that understand batteries their cars will never be fully optimized for performance and longevity. Look at the battery degregation of the leaf, it\u2019s atrocious. \n\nLastly the dealer network is not friendly to EVs.  They have no maintenance, other than tires and windshield wipers EVs aren\u2019t on a regular maintenance schedule and since maintenance is how dealerships make most of their profits they are reluctant to sell them.  \n\nAll the talk of compelling EVs has been vapourware for the last 6 years.  https://www.topspeed.com/cars/audi/2013-audi-a3-sportback-e-tron-ar147840.html.

Their gross profits were over 20% on all their vehicles and that\u2019s while their model 3 lines are ramping and not fully efficient. This quarter I expect that the margin numbers to improve even more.  The cap and trade credits are available to everyone and  are  not going away.  When I hear critics mention them I have one question.  What do you expect Tesla to do with their credits if not cash them in? They\u2019re not producing ice cars so they have no need to keep them. They will continue to sell these until we\u2019re in a place where humans don\u2019t need to lower their C02 consumption.\n\nThe comparison to go pro is interesting however the one downfall of go pro is that they relied on one product,  Tesla has a very extensive roadmap, they will be doubling revenue every year and a half for the next 10 years at least if they bring all their planned products to market.  Have you looked at the year over year sales of BMWs or Diamler recently?  Things are not looking good. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious about the autpilot tech you mentioned on Mercedes cars.

Meaning if there is less demand, they simply produce less. They are also vertically integrated for repairs, warranty, charging stations. The bulk of profit made from dealership is maintenance. Tesla will be eating up that profit.\n\n2) Just look at I-Pace coming to U.S. in late 2019, the car was suppose to have 300+ range comparable to Tesla. As it turn out, that range is 234 miles in EPA standards while Model 3 is at 310 range. You might see 234 range as enough, but is it really? Tesla's 310 range gets a 70% reduced range when temperature drop below 10 degree. Imagine i-Pace range dropping 70% on an already reduced range. None of the car including VW coming out with good range for 2019. Range is extremely important especially for EVs. None of them also built charging stations across America as comprehensive as Tesla even though Tesla's charging stations are not that comprehensive at all.\n\n3) While true that REAL competition is coming out in 2020/2021, but Tesla roadster is set to have 600+ miles range by then with their new battery technology. So, sure that competition will be out, but by then Tesla already have a head start.\n\n4) Software is HARD. There is a reason why phone only has iOS, Android, and Windows. Dont think for a second that building an AI will be a piece of cake. There is a reason why silicon valley is the center of software tech because it requires a lot of man power and ingenuity. This is not something you can just whip up or piece together. That requires tons of innovations. That's also be frank here, when was the last time tech really innovated in a traditional car? They are still clunky and slow. Tesla's center console feels as buttery smooth as your iPhone. I highly doubt that GM or Ford can manage to create great software at all. While GM was planning to launch super cruise in Cadillac CT6 2019, that dream had ended.

Taking boring company for instance. Elon musk is combining research from SpaceX rocket tech to improve the speed of the drill and battery tech from Tesla to prevent mono-dioxide building up in tunnels. Traditional boring gas machine will output tons of mono-dioxide in a close space tunnel where as battery wont. SpaceX is also launching thousands of near earth satellites for superior connectivity. That also allows Tesla cars to be connected anywhere in the world to utilize superior cloud services for huge number of applications like real time traffic monitoring to allow self driving AI to automatically reroute, major complimentary computation from cloud to boost Tesla's AI chip. Not to mention, NASA is sharing innovation with spaceX which can be applied to Tesla and that includes AI. \n\nThe list goes on and on. Let's say by some miracle that one company can solve all these monumental issues from battery to AI and outpaced Tesla's innovations. Tesla having just 10% of the overall global car market is already gigantic. Not to mention, Tesla is also planning to compete against Uber. They are also building massive Gigabyte worth of batteries. Then, dont forget solar roof. Finally, merging boring company with Tesla or even acquiring neurolink which are all Elon Musk's companies. \n\n&#x200B;", "parent_score": 7, "parent_ratio": 0.0}, {"time": 1544366589.0, "submission_id": "a4bjd4", "comment_id": "ebfgkal", "body": "They are under investigation!

I didn't think they'd be buying anything in the marijuana sector just yet, let alone at that price. Management has repeatedly said in the past that they have no plans for marijuana right now. In hindsight, I guess they were holding their cards close to their chest. That being said, I'm sure they have a game plan for their MJ play. They probably anticipate legalization taking place soon and wanted to get their foot in the door to have some products ready for the market when the time comes. Altria will get to elect 4 of the 7 board directors for CRON. They'll be able to steer the company in a way that's profitable for both. I too am hoping management sheds some light on what their vision is for CRON.\n\nThe JUUL stake (if it happens) make sense. JUUL has handily beaten big tobacco in the e-cig market. As opposed to continuing a weaker product (the Mark Ten never seemed to have good reviews [https://vapingdaily.com/best-electronic-cigarettes/mark-ten-review/](https://vapingdaily.com/best-electronic-cigarettes/mark-ten-review/)), they've decided to cut their losses and use the power of their balance sheet to see if they can join the leader in the space. JUUL has a good product (and a little depressingly have managed to hook a new younger generation onto nicotine). Altria on the other hand has significant expertise dealing with the FDA. Both can benefit from a partnership. \n\nTruth be told, I was hoping for an increase in buybacks at these prices and a boost in their BUD stake. However, PM and MO have a history of careful capital allocation because of the nature of the industry they operate in. I'm willing to give management the benefit of the doubt. My cost basis is currently 58.30. I will gradually keep averaging down. I think there's chance we might see MO drop some more in the next few months.

Go pickup Juul at a discounted rate as their viability has been all but shattered (and you failed in the vapor space already), squeeze out any profit you can from them, get in on the early stages of corporate marijuana involvement, utilize Juul as a way to maximize marijuana vapor in the future.
