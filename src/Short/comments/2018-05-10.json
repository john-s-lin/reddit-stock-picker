Neither homeowners nor renters. Now that is awesome\n\nNot everyone is forward thinking to 2020 (much less 2050) and has the financial means to make that leap now. There is a large difference between the green world that some would like and reality. I'm not saying anything against green or solar; I'm simply offering a view that there is a large part of the world without the means and/or desire to spend what to many people consider to be a fortune on something like solar panels. The lack of consideration (and not directing this towards you, just saying I've seen it broadly) towards the reality for many people is probably where a fair amount of the upset towards the green movement comes from. I constantly read on here about how \"solar is great so why isn't it everywhere\" - and I've read that on here for years, even through the Sun Edison bankruptcy (where the constant refrain was, \"it's solar so it has to be good, right?\".... all the way to ch 11.) We're still at the point where - for many people - solar is a luxury. Maybe - as has often been discussed - panel prices will come down much further over time, but there's going to be some real losers in the business of continually trying to produce a commodity product a bit cheaper than your competitor. As much as some may not understand this, there are people who do not want a solar panel and are not going to be thrilled that they didn't have the choice not to.\n\nPeople need to invest in the world that there is, not the one they'd like. There's tons of stories about solar panel leases complicating or even entirely getting in the way of home sales (https://www.dailyrepublic.com/projects/home-seller/solar-panel-leases-a-growing-problem-for-home-sellers/.) People need to understand that not everyone wants a panel on their house as much as you think it's right for them to have it and some people don't want that cost no matter how wonderful for the environment you think it is. It's just human nature. People will still drive gas powered vehicles in the years ahead, no matter how awful for the environment you believe it to be. Some will do it because they want to, some will do it because they have to. Some perhaps a little bit of column A, some a little bit of column B. \n\nAdditionally, I remain fascinated by how much focus there is on Reddit on solar panels and luxury EVs and how little there is on things like clean water. (shrug)\n\nSo, I'm not being negative on solar or green in general, I'm pushing for some consideration towards human nature and the reality for many people and for the green obsessed to perhaps consider that when they invest. There is this belief on Reddit that \"there should be a solar panel on every roof and a Tesla in every driveway\" and act perplexed as to why that hasn't happened yet. That would be because it's not reality/remotely realistic. \n\nCalifornia is going to now *force* the added cost of a solar panel on every roof of newly built houses (how's that going to go over in rural/lower income areas?) and it will - IMO - run into a lot of upset on one side and a lot of people on the other side who have good intentions but will not consider the reasons why the other side is so upset and will just tell them, \"but it's good for the environment\".

There is a large difference between the green world that some would like and reality. I'm not saying anything against green or solar; I'm simply offering a view that there is a large part of the world without the means and/or desire to spend what to many people consider to be a fortune on something like solar panels. The lack of consideration (and not directing this towards you, just saying I've seen it broadly) towards the reality for many people is probably where a fair amount of the upset towards the green movement comes from. I constantly read on here about how \"solar is great so why isn't it everywhere\" - and I've read that on here for years, even through the Sun Edison bankruptcy (where the constant refrain was, \"it's solar so it has to be good, right?\".... all the way to ch 11.) We're still at the point where - for many people - solar is a luxury. Maybe - as has often been discussed - panel prices will come down much further over time, but there's going to be some real losers in the business of continually trying to produce a commodity product a bit cheaper than your competitor.

People need to understand that not everyone wants a panel on their house as much as you think it's right for them to have it and some people don't want that cost no matter how wonderful for the environment you think it is. It's just human nature. People will still drive gas powered vehicles in the years ahead, no matter how awful for the environment you believe it to be. Some will do it because they want to, some will do it because they have to. Some perhaps a little bit of column A, some a little bit of column B. \n\nAdditionally, I remain fascinated by how much focus there is on Reddit on solar panels and luxury EVs and how little there is on things like clean water. (shrug)\n\nSo, I'm not being negative on solar or green in general, I'm pushing for some consideration towards human nature and the reality for many people and for the green obsessed to perhaps consider that when they invest. There is this belief on Reddit that \"there should be a solar panel on every roof and a Tesla in every driveway\" and act perplexed as to why that hasn't happened yet. That would be because it's not reality/remotely realistic. \n\nCalifornia is going to now *force* the added cost of a solar panel on every roof of newly built houses (how's that going to go over in rural/lower income areas?) and it will - IMO - run into a lot of upset on one side and a lot of people on the other side who have good intentions but will not consider the reasons why the other side is so upset and will just tell them, \"but it's good for the environment\".
