It carries some of the largest debt in the industry and if interest rates pick up (which they are) they are going to be unable to maintain a cash flow to handle all there obligations.

This is a oil stock with its roots in deepwell drilling. It also pays a great dividend and after the collapse of oil they were able to restructure and gather more assets to take advantage of the new increase in oil. Now if you believe oil is going on the wayside dont buy this. However, i believe oil is going to keep rising due to the many geopolitic issues that are driving demand up and supply down.

This is a oil stock with its roots in deepwell drilling. It also pays a great dividend and after the collapse of oil they were able to restructure and gather more assets to take advantage of the new increase in oil. Now if you believe oil is going on the wayside dont buy this. However, i believe oil is going to keep rising due to the many geopolitic issues that are driving demand up and supply down.

As we are witnessing right now China is a huge powerhouse player that rivals American corporations and laughs at the attempts to impose tarriffs on it. Also with chinas ever growing population and the acces to a 1/3 of the worlds population in its backyard they have a plenty of ways to develope growth.
