Set it up so that it happens automatically and don't set an end date. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to put some meat on the bone here are the numbers: \n\nLet's say your loan is for 10k, you leave it in the stock market for those 5 years that you have the loan. Let's say the market does great and gives you an annual return of 8%. At the end of those 5 years your 10k has grown to $14,693.\n\nNow at the same time let's take your loan and say you pay it off the 10k according to the loan schedule at a interest rate of 8% over 5 years. When you are done with the loan you will have paid $12,166.\n\nOn one hand you earn +$4,693\n\nand \n\nOn the other hand you lose -$2,166\n\nMaking your total gain +$2,527\n\nIn that case your dad would be correct, because the your market interest is compounded as the market grows and because of that you will have more money at the end of the day by leaving it in the market. \n\nThe obvious flaw with this thinking is that there are no guarantees that the next 5 years of the market will provide you any gains at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you however do what I suggest \"pay the loan then pay back your account\" this is what will happen: \n\nYou pay off the 10k and own your car saving you from the $2,166 in interest that you would have paid. Then you pay your car payment into the your stock account for 5 years. Even if you don't invest it you will end those five years with about $12k in the account. If you account for the fact that you did not lose money in the loan you are pretty darn close to the 8% year over year returns that you were hoping for in your dad's ideal situation. Only by doing it this way it is guaranteed.\n\nYou will  have saved $2k above the initial $10k you have in stocks today. \n\n From there if you decide to invest that money as it goes into the account AND you are lucky enough to get the average 7% return over those five years you could end up with about $14k. \n\n$2k saved and $2k earned in investments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost any way you chop it up it is better to pay the loan **BUT** you must put that money back into your investments to make it work. If you don't have the discipline to do that then your dad is 100% correct and you should leave it where it is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 7, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 30, "submission_ratio": 0.23333333333333334, "submission_title": "What should you do during a recession?

Set it up so that it happens automatically and don't set an end date. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to put some meat on the bone here are the numbers: \n\nLet's say your loan is for 10k, you leave it in the stock market for those 5 years that you have the loan. Let's say the market does great and gives you an annual return of 8%. At the end of those 5 years your 10k has grown to $14,693.\n\nNow at the same time let's take your loan and say you pay it off the 10k according to the loan schedule at a interest rate of 8% over 5 years. When you are done with the loan you will have paid $12,166.\n\nOn one hand you earn +$4,693\n\nand \n\nOn the other hand you lose -$2,166\n\nMaking your total gain +$2,527\n\nIn that case your dad would be correct, because the your market interest is compounded as the market grows and because of that you will have more money at the end of the day by leaving it in the market. \n\nThe obvious flaw with this thinking is that there are no guarantees that the next 5 years of the market will provide you any gains at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you however do what I suggest \"pay the loan then pay back your account\" this is what will happen: \n\nYou pay off the 10k and own your car saving you from the $2,166 in interest that you would have paid. Then you pay your car payment into the your stock account for 5 years. Even if you don't invest it you will end those five years with about $12k in the account. If you account for the fact that you did not lose money in the loan you are pretty darn close to the 8% year over year returns that you were hoping for in your dad's ideal situation. Only by doing it this way it is guaranteed.\n\nYou will  have saved $2k above the initial $10k you have in stocks today. \n\n From there if you decide to invest that money as it goes into the account AND you are lucky enough to get the average 7% return over those five years you could end up with about $14k. \n\n$2k saved and $2k earned in investments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost any way you chop it up it is better to pay the loan **BUT** you must put that money back into your investments to make it work.

If I take a look at my girlfriend's family I can see some clear differences. No one has any savings, and the only one who's owned a stock got burnt pretty bad in the 90s boom and then quit. I've spent many years convincing her that savings and investing is important, and I'm happy that she's now transferring those 10% of the wage to an index fund.\n\nI'm not really trying to deny that people are responsible for their own economy. And you could call every non-investor and bad investor idiots, and you wouldn't be wrong. But if no one has explained to you how to make educated financial decisions it's not surprising you'd make dumb decisions. It's a bit like people not having a clue about safe sex imo.

Currently only ONE game (available for consumers) supports RTX, and in its current form DX12 does not fully support ray tracing.  For RTX to be fully realized you will need massive support from developers.  But again, even IF all that was realized right now, (lets play make believe and say 90% of the markets game are RTX compatible), it is STILL a terrible buy.  Why? because it is so power hungry that a near 2 thousand dollar video card can barely run it at 1080p, and at 4k?? not even close.  The only redeeming thing about the 2080ti, and the quatro rtx (when it comes out) are their AI processing systems, which (on paper) sound amazing.  But again, its tech that is \"built\" into the card, but no one as yet supports it.   Think of it like this, you buy a Tesla, and it has \"cross charge\" which allows you to charge your car in 30 seconds, dead to full.. But no cross charge is not widely available, in fact only one person has it, oh and if you use a cross charge system it limits your cars speed to 35mph.  Sound like someone people are willing to drop their money on?  Another thing to look at is availability, even though the 2080 and 2080ti were released in limited stock... Almost every online retailer still has them, meanwhile the 1080, 1080ti, and titan V were almost permanently out of stock for MONTHS after launch.   All this tells me is that Nvidia is trying to play the loss close to the chest, get some new tech on the market in a desperate attempt to retain market share, and if the AI deal with Google does not get completed by mid December I FULLY expect AMD to drop their next line of GPUs, which could tank Nvidias current strategy.   Nvidia is losing mobile share as more manufactures turn to in house graphics chips, they are still winning Gaming share, and production share, but the margins are waxing, and it will not take much for AMD to give them a serious run for their money.

But before you ask any question make sure you see the following links:\n\n* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy\n* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell\n* If you're asking about basic terminology, see [Tastytrade glossary,](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/glossary) then feel free to ask a more in depth question afterwards, basic terms:\n * **exercising an option** - when you use your call option to buy 100 shares or put option to sell a 100 shares\n * **strike price** - The price at which stock is purchased or sold when an option is exercised\n * **ITM** - when a call option's strike price is below the stock price, or put's strike price is above the stock price\n * **OTM** - when a call option's strike price is above the stock price, or put's strike price is below the stock price\n * **ATM** - when the option's strike price is at or very near the stock price\n * **long options** (aka long call or long put) - buying options\n * **short options** (aka short call or short put) - selling (or writing) options\n * **combo or option strategy** - buying and/or selling multiple options\n * **debit** - what you're paying to buy an option or combo\n * **credit or premium** - what you're receiving (money) to sell an option or combo\n * **covered call** - when you buy stock and then sell calls\n * **naked** - when you sell calls or puts without owning stock or other options for the same stock\n* Wondering what those [option strategies are:  OptionsPlaybook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/), common combos:\n * **Debit call spread** (vertical debit spread) - generally a *bullish* combo that involves buying a call and selling a call at a lower strike; the cost of buying the spread combo is lower than just buying a call, however this reduces your max profit, but also reduces your max loss \n * **Credit call spread** (vertical credit spread) - generally a *bearish* combo that involves selling a call and buying a call at a lower strike; this reduces your max loss compared to just selling naked, but it also reduces your max profit, however you get the full credit upfront\n * **Strangle** - Two naked options, a call and a put, this creates a *neutral* combo and you profit as price stays between the two strike prices\n * **Iron condor** - same as the strangle except with protection, reduced profit but also reducing your max loss\n* A thorough explanation of nearly every [option strategy explained by TastyTrade here](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn)\n * [Vertical debit spreads video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptxT5wdWfJQ) - Mike and his whiteboard\n * [Iron condors video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Q9BSaF7cY) - Mike and his whiteboard\n * [Iron Fly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqB7BGBLXYw) - Mike and his whiteboard\n* [Book recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8qfs14/options_book_list_review_of_all_books_that_helped/) by the options community at r/options (subscribe while you're at it)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is Theta,\" then google \"investopedia theta\" and click the investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nSee past & current [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  And use this link to see past stock [options discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+options%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n", "parent_text": "I am not...I almost sold at 290ish but I was overseas....\n\nI bought at 10-14 though.", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1542299234.0, "submission_id": "9xbkdf", "comment_id": "e9r6ok5", "body": "My interpretation is that he was tipped off by executives, but used the meteorology as a cover when interviewing for the Phoenix Club ", "score": 10, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 7, "submission_ratio": 1.4285714285714286, "submission_title": "Can anybody please tell me what is happening here, it is about how Eduardo Saverin made 300k with oil futures?", "submission_text": " \n\nAccording to wikipedia:\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Harvard, Saverin took advantage of Brazil's lax insider trading regulations and made $300,000 via strategic investments in the oil industry.\n\nAccording to the book 'Accidental Billionares':\n\n(These are random paragraphs that mentioned how he made it)\n\n\"We focus mostly on oil futures.

Sometimes it\u2019s nice to message people especially those who don\u2019t have iphones with iMessage and you get to see if they screenshot if you send something sketchy. However people who post stories you can get double or even triple the views if you post it on instagram because people tend to only have 100 snapchat friends vs hundreds or thousands of insta followers. Snapchat is winning if you want to send a quick picture to someone. Nobody sends pictures to eachother on instagram. Also, instagram is winning in the filter competition and kids love their filters. I know i\u2019m all over the place so I will summarize by saying... Snapchat isn\u2019t going anywhere because sending quick pictures and private messages are too important to young people.

How come?", "parent_text": "Nobody else answered the basic, beginner aspect of your question:  Earnings per share (EPS) has nothing directly to do with stock price (you seem to think that if a stock goes from 1.50 to 2.00 it should have 0.50 EPS, this is backwards.  You, the share holder, earned 50 cents per share, but EPS is the COMPANYS earnings, and has nothing to do with share price, at least, directly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCalculating EPS is simply the companies earnings (for a beginner, call it profit) divided by the number of shares that exist for this company.  ECYT, as a company, is losing money, so a negative number divided by number of shares equals a negative earnings per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe better question might be \"why does the stock price go up for a company that is losing money?\"  And there are tons of answers to that question.  Typically, it is the market's opinion of how much the company will earn in the future.  Other times it can be based on how much the market thinks the stock could be bought-out for.  In biotech, it is usually this last one.
