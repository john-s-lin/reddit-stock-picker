When you buy stock, you're not buying this little green or red number that flickers up and down all day long. When you invest in a company, you become a *part owner* of that company, just as if you were buying an apartment building or a farm, you'd want to know a lot about them. Think about owning that company for a long time, and prepare yourself by learning in advance.\n\n2. Only invest in *companies you're capable of understanding.* Don't even bother with things you hear people talk about on t.v. or tips you read about online. Stick to what you know and you'll do well.\n\n3. Invest as though you'll only be able to invest in 20 things in your lifetime. Like you got a punch card with 20 holes you can punch, each for a different investment. If you think this way you'll spend more time thinking about each company, and your investing results over your lifetime will be much better.\n\n4. Great investors read *all the time.* I've never met an outstanding investor who wasn't always reading; pay special attention to a company's annual report. If you don't know how to order one and have a paper version mailed to you, just go to the investor relations section of the website and enter your info. If you'd rather read a PDF annual report you can download it instantly from the \"Investor Relations\" section of the company's website. Most people tell me they buy stock without ever reading the company's annual report - that' s a huge mistake, in my opinion. It's an *enormous benefit* to read the annual report before ever investing. Warren Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger read all day long, hundreds of pages a day.\n\n5. Write down the five companies you understand massively well. Write them down right now: on a piece of paper, or open a note on your phone and just type the names. *Learning about these companies is your priority now.* Learn as much about them as you can, so you become an *expert* in them. One day you'll know more about them than some Wall Street analysts. Think of yourself as an investigative reporter, and just find every detail you can until you know more than most people.

Hotel chains are fighting back. I'll agree that PCLN is also doing better than EXPE, but aside from maybe CTRP or something travel is just really not something I want to invest in in general but moreso lately.\n\n\"What really worries Sorenson are the OTAs, because they could potentially undermine Marriott\u2019s value proposition to its hotel owners. Sites like Expedia.com and Priceline.com have become increasingly valuable to owners as a way to fill in gaps between the bookings that come from Marriott\u2019s system. But for every room booked, the owners pay a fee to the OTA\u2014on top of what they\u2019re already paying to Marriott. The danger is that down the road owners might start deciding to drop Marriott (and its fees) and go exclusively with OTA bookings. That\u2019s why Sorenson led the charge for hotels in the negotiations with Expedia in late 2015. He saw that the travel sites were gaining leverage. \u201cThe OTAs were only booking about 8% of our rooms,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that was up from 4% three or four years earlier, and I thought it would keep growing.\u201d\n\n\"Led by Sorenson, the owners of Marriott brands formed a united front. Their position: If Expedia declined to make the concessions Sorenson was demanding, the owners would pull their offerings from Expedia en masse. The negotiations were in a standoff until 24 hours before the deadline. Expedia finally broke the deadlock by giving ground and, for instance, reducing the booking fee for owners from around 16% to 12%. And Sorenson scored a coup that bound owners more tightly than ever to Marriott.\n\n\"So far, Sorenson\u2019s strategy of building scale is working. The OTAs\u2019 share of bookings remains flat at around 8%, and more new hotels are signing with Marriott and other branded hoteliers than ever before. The combined rewards programs are growing faster than ever, says Marriott, at around 1 million new members a month. As long as those higher-margin direct bookings remain strong, Marriott\u2019s owners will be happy and its business healthy.\"\n\n (article from last year, but well worth a read: http://fortune.com/2017/06/14/marriott-arne-sorenson-starwood-acquisition-airbnb/)\n\n", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "Expedia down 35% since June", "submission_text": "Thoughts? revenue up Y/Y but didn't meet forecast expectations four quarters in a row so it keeps tanking.", "parent_text": "Expedia down 35% since June Thoughts? revenue up Y/Y but didn't meet forecast expectations four quarters in a row so it keeps tanking.", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1518229459.0, "submission_id": "7wilda", "comment_id": "du0mzjv", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 0.5, "submission_title": "Expedia down 35% since June", "submission_text": "Thoughts? revenue up Y/Y but didn't meet forecast expectations four quarters in a row so it keeps tanking.", "parent_text": "Expedia down 35% since June Thoughts? revenue up Y/Y but didn't meet forecast expectations four quarters in a row so it keeps tanking.", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}, {"time": 1518279127.0, "submission_id": "7wilda", "comment_id": "du1esoz", "body": "It's still almost double its price from 5 years ago...
