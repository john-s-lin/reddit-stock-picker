Movie pass did the opposite and attracted the free loaders instead of limiting the offer.  I will tell you that AMC theaters have made it way more complicated to go to the movies as you have to pick your seat at the one I went to for Avengers.  \n\nIf I was AMC though, I would simplify the movie and also bundle with tickets a small popcorn and a drink for 20 dollars.  Right now, pricing between 12-20 dollars is incredibly more flexible and people don't see a difference between 12 and 18 as much on a psychological level unless they are penny pinchers.  That is just me though.  Movie pass still says though that people overuse it in the first few months then drag it out and probably cancel.

So you\u2019re going to go up against HMNY, full knowing that they lose money and you have no contacts with the B&M theaters? Basically, you\u2019ll have to burn money until you erase them from history or you\u2019ll just burn all of your money and become nonexistent. \n\nGreat example is??? Groupon! Basic codes and up and running within weeks, months. Everyone copied Groupon\u2019s concept of \u201cGroup-buys\u201d. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re familiar with the concept of a GroupBuy, but it has been around for a long time. I used to participate in Group Buys when I was a poor kid, trying to buy cool parts for my \u201cJDM\u201d Honda/Acura. Any who, after everyone saw Groupons success, every single idiot was trying to be the next Groupon. I mean, it\u2019s a simple code like you say, nothing serious. But Groupon burned tons and tons and tons of cash. And so tons and tons of money was poured into these copycat Groupons and many people lost billions investing in these copycats.\n\nGroupons largest competitors? Amazon! LivingSocial, Walmart, Best Buy? BH Photos? So yeah, you can\u2019t just copy people and think you\u2019ll win by beating prices or some silly idea like opening shop in a month. Groupon acquired Living Social for $0. They won because they were first to market and because they dominated. They dominated because of their contacts. \n\nAny who, I can see HMNY MoviePass as a profitable company. There\u2019s gonna be some major changes, just like when Groupon in it\u2019s early stages to now. Shit changes, that\u2019s how companies mature. They\u2019re not gonna go to zero. I don\u2019t see it. But you never know, I doubt it though. Especially if someone like you are so short on it, I\u2019m feeling it\u2019ll be the next biggest comeback.
