Maybe the reward isn\u2019t worth the risk in this case.

So the question is basically, if you take AMZN as an example, are there greater chances AMZN will see $1970/share ever again in the next 7 months, in the event I bought today and the stock went down? I think the chances are yes it will come back to $1970/share so maybe I should just continue random day trading of let\u2019s call it AMZN, and if ever it goes down, I\u2019ll hold my position until I\u2019m back up.

More on how that might have worked:\n\nUnder that scenario, one step would have involved the spinoff or sale of FCA\u2019s Magneti Marelli parts business, a move FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne still wants to pull off this year.\n\nAnother step would have combined Alfa Romeo and Maserati into a separate company to be sold. A third would have seen the Jeep and Ram brands being sold as a package. Finally, the remaining European, U.S. and Latin American businesses would have been offered to a fourth buyer, possibly a Chinese group.\n\nThe second source said FCA was open to accepting a $22 billion deal if Alfa and Maserati were excluded.
