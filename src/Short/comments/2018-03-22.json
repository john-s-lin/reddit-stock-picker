I back my belief with 4 arguments: 1) this is an old bull (and old things get sick), 2) reversal of interest rate trend, 3) return of volatility, and 4) stretch valuation especially among growth stocks relative to history. \n\n1st, this is a very old bull market relative to all bull markets. There are two implications. One, market participants are conditioned to expect gains for a longer period of time this time around than almost any other bull market. This makes them sloppy in their analysis, which results in substandard business activities to flourish (frauds, hype, accounting gimmicks, short-termism, etc.). Some of the activities I\u2019m seeing out there from a short prespective is just insane, for example LFIN being added to the R2K despite being a \u201cquestionable\u201d business.  Second implication: if you believe that the life of bull markets are finite, and you believe that the life expectancy of a bull market distributes around a mean, then it is logical to assume that the current bull market\u2019s life cycle is closer to \u201cdemise\u201d. \n\n2nd, interest rate is rising while we are seeing signs of inflation. This is a massive change from the trend of lower interest rates from the financial crisis through the middle of 2016. The government knows that the monetary stimulus is dead and attempted to stimulate the stock market though massive fiscal intervention (tax cut, big recent spending bill). Much of the tax reform will be one-time in nature as EPS of full-tax payers go up by over 20% or so, and capex is purchased in Year 1 and Year 2 of the reform, etc. What the capex tax incentive does is actually pull forward depreciation benefits (to cash flow), which is the equivalent of giving the market a shot in the arm and setting it up for lower depreciation benefits later. In other words, there is little the government can do to stimulate the stock market after this point. Maybe they\u2019ll try raise geopolitical tension so to justify more military spending, which is historically a great way to stimulate the economy while being palatable to the republican base, but at this point they are getting desperate trying to buy time, hoping the crash will come after the election. Every politican wishes to manage the market to their political career, but on the aggregate they are not competent enough to do so with any consistency.  \n\n3rd, the return of volatility shows that the market is waking up to the massive risks from all sides. FB can blow up, which exposes the weakness of those seemingly unstoppable tech giants. GE may be a fraud. Trade wars, potentially. Political risks.  \n\n4th, valuation is getting crazy, especially the valuation of growth companies. For example, look at the multiple MULE is getting acquired or the multiples of SZ, a recent IPO (if you don\u2019t know how to look \u2014 they are high). In my view, the valuation of growth stocks is the best measure of investor optimism.  To justify higher price targets, people are starting to reach into their imaginations rather than using historical multiples, peer multiples, or discounted cash flow models (especially with rising interesting rates). This reminds of of the stories I\u2019ve heard during the dot.com bubble, when people started pulling reasons out of thin air to justify price targets. This kind of forced optimism is collective self delusion, and delusion tend to end poorly.

For example, look at the multiple MULE is getting acquired or the multiples of SZ, a recent IPO (if you don\u2019t know how to look \u2014 they are high). In my view, the valuation of growth stocks is the best measure of investor optimism.  To justify higher price targets, people are starting to reach into their imaginations rather than using historical multiples, peer multiples, or discounted cash flow models (especially with rising interesting rates). This reminds of of the stories I\u2019ve heard during the dot.com bubble, when people started pulling reasons out of thin air to justify price targets. This kind of forced optimism is collective self delusion, and delusion tend to end poorly.

Is this the beginning of the next market crash or just a correction? Who's got the factual data to back up their ideas?", "parent_text": "This is likely a set up for a crash, in my opinion. I back my belief with 4 arguments: 1) this is an old bull (and old things get sick), 2) reversal of interest rate trend, 3) return of volatility, and 4) stretch valuation especially among growth stocks relative to history. \n\n1st, this is a very old bull market relative to all bull markets. There are two implications. One, market participants are conditioned to expect gains for a longer period of time this time around than almost any other bull market. This makes them sloppy in their analysis, which results in substandard business activities to flourish (frauds, hype, accounting gimmicks, short-termism, etc.). Some of the activities I\u2019m seeing out there from a short prespective is just insane, for example LFIN being added to the R2K despite being a \u201cquestionable\u201d business.  Second implication: if you believe that the life of bull markets are finite, and you believe that the life expectancy of a bull market distributes around a mean, then it is logical to assume that the current bull market\u2019s life cycle is closer to \u201cdemise\u201d. \n\n2nd, interest rate is rising while we are seeing signs of inflation. This is a massive change from the trend of lower interest rates from the financial crisis through the middle of 2016. The government knows that the monetary stimulus is dead and attempted to stimulate the stock market though massive fiscal intervention (tax cut, big recent spending bill). Much of the tax reform will be one-time in nature as EPS of full-tax payers go up by over 20% or so, and capex is purchased in Year 1 and Year 2 of the reform, etc. What the capex tax incentive does is actually pull forward depreciation benefits (to cash flow), which is the equivalent of giving the market a shot in the arm and setting it up for lower depreciation benefits later. In other words, there is little the government can do to stimulate the stock market after this point. Maybe they\u2019ll try raise geopolitical tension so to justify more military spending, which is historically a great way to stimulate the economy while being palatable to the republican base, but at this point they are getting desperate trying to buy time, hoping the crash will come after the election. Every politican wishes to manage the market to their political career, but on the aggregate they are not competent enough to do so with any consistency.  \n\n3rd, the return of volatility shows that the market is waking up to the massive risks from all sides. FB can blow up, which exposes the weakness of those seemingly unstoppable tech giants. GE may be a fraud. Trade wars, potentially. Political risks.  \n\n4th, valuation is getting crazy, especially the valuation of growth companies. For example, look at the multiple MULE is getting acquired or the multiples of SZ, a recent IPO (if you don\u2019t know how to look \u2014 they are high). In my view, the valuation of growth stocks is the best measure of investor optimism.  To justify higher price targets, people are starting to reach into their imaginations rather than using historical multiples, peer multiples, or discounted cash flow models (especially with rising interesting rates).
