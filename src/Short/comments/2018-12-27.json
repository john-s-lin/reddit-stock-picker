How about the potential of a massive war between nation states, probably as a result of one of the above factors?\n\nYou have a strategy here, a very very basic one, which HAS worked wonders for the last 3 decades, but if you look back in time there are very long periods when the stock market made absolutely no gains (usually after a bubble popped *cough cough*), and these were times when the planet was still capable of supporting more humans, we had no headwind of climate change over our heads (even if you don't believe in it, governments do, and they'll tax us like it is real, so the effects on the economy will exist regardless), etc. Between 1929 and 1954 the Dow Jones made absolutely no gains, and even when it got back to the levels it was at in 1929 in nominal terms, in real terms, in terms of purchasing power, it was still very far behind.\n\nIt is just crazy for me to think that people like you don't even consider these risks, just blindly throw your money in \"for the long-term\" thinking that \"long-term\" it will 100% go up, when really that thinking has only worked well for about 30 years. History is mired in periods where the stock market didn't go up, when certain headwinds that exist today didn't even exist. Sure, other economic headwinds existed...But most of those are/will eventually be relevant again today.\n\nThe market has pretty much always had an upward slant... A lot of that has to do with depreciation of money though, don't forget this very important factor. Don't think that someone who bought the Dow in 1995 at $4000 in 1994 now has 5.5x the purchasing power that they had back then... It is more like 2.5x - 3x as much (if you believe the government stats...and this is at a bull market peak.. hell, they probably had *less* purchasing power at the bottom of the 2008/2009 meltdown)... And if you look at housing prices? Man.... It is more like *equal* purchasing power. And this was during an incredibly good time for stocks, historically speaking.

How about the potential of a massive war between nation states, probably as a result of one of the above factors?\n\nYou have a strategy here, a very very basic one, which HAS worked wonders for the last 3 decades, but if you look back in time there are very long periods when the stock market made absolutely no gains (usually after a bubble popped *cough cough*), and these were times when the planet was still capable of supporting more humans, we had no headwind of climate change over our heads (even if you don't believe in it, governments do, and they'll tax us like it is real, so the effects on the economy will exist regardless), etc. Between 1929 and 1954 the Dow Jones made absolutely no gains, and even when it got back to the levels it was at in 1929 in nominal terms, in real terms, in terms of purchasing power, it was still very far behind.\n\nIt is just crazy for me to think that people like you don't even consider these risks, just blindly throw your money in \"for the long-term\" thinking that \"long-term\" it will 100% go up, when really that thinking has only worked well for about 30 years. History is mired in periods where the stock market didn't go up, when certain headwinds that exist today didn't even exist. Sure, other economic headwinds existed...But most of those are/will eventually be relevant again today.\n\nThe market has pretty much always had an upward slant... A lot of that has to do with depreciation of money though, don't forget this very important factor. Don't think that someone who bought the Dow in 1995 at $4000 in 1994 now has 5.5x the purchasing power that they had back then... It is more like 2.5x - 3x as much (if you believe the government stats...and this is at a bull market peak.. hell, they probably had *less* purchasing power at the bottom of the 2008/2009 meltdown)... And if you look at housing prices? Man.... It is more like *equal* purchasing power. And this was during an incredibly good time for stocks, historically speaking.

Student debt is insane, theres debt all over the place the pentagon lost trillions of dollars, quanitative easing is fueling inflation. I dont see how anyone can think we arent fucked. We have some serious problems that people keep ignoring and i think silver and gold is the lifeboat for me and my family. If im wrong ill eat my hat.
