He charges a low fee and utilizes rebalancing and all those strategies. \n\nI took this step mainly because of how close I am to retirement. Of course immediately after, we had a bull market and I did ok, but nothing like the indexes. Now we're in a correction and I think I'm still in good shape. The point is, I'm way too conservative the closer I get to retirement. Using a professional has allowed me to relax a little while still getting a return that should be adequate well into retirement years. \n\nBe mindful of your feelings. Getting a top high risk return or 100% safety isn't the goal. Being able to sustain yourself during the retirement years is the goal. Even cash has a risk. It can have a negative return if inflation roars back.  I've never fooled with bonds at all, and indeed they were a poor investment for years. Now they're coming back and having about half my money in them I can see the benefit.

To find the truth we must challenge our perception of the problem... **What we think we know about volatility is all wrong**.

Namely, a statistic measuring the past outcomes of a game to keep score, but existing externally from the game. **The problem is volatility isn't just keeping score, but is massively affecting the outcome of the game itself in real time**.
