The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its total assets in securities of the index or in depositary receipts representing securities of the index.\"\n\nWhat I've highlighted in bold seems to be a key distinction between both funds; ARKK is actively managed by fund managers who are seeking to fill the portfolio with companies that they find to be \"disruptive innovat\\[ors\\].\" ROBO however, is tracking a certain index. It is important to note the ARKK's net expense ratio is 0.75%, while ROBO's net expense ratio is 0.95%; ROBO has a higher cost of maintenance. Both funds are non-diversified. It is also important to note that ARKK's strategy allows for the fund to hold up to 35% of assets in non-investment-theme-related securities, while ROBO has the flexibility to invest in only 20% of non-related securities. If you look through the holdings of both funds themselves, it will be quite apparent that their performance will be different; additionally, ARKK has about 1/2 the number of holdings that ROBO does, and 47.26% of ARKK's holdings are it's top 10 holdings, whereas for ROBO, it's roughly 19.42%--in plain English, ROBO has more assets spread across a wider investment plane.\n\nSo therefore, I cannot give you an answer as to which one is better than the other because simply, they are different kinds of funds!

Not that it really matters, just a small improvement to consider. No one wants to click \"enter\" every time they want to return to the dashboard. \n\nTake a peak at this site : [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) has a sweet interface, and nice and comforting visuals. Tbh, the visuals are too friendly on this site for me, and gives me a sense of unease in their professionalism. But that's just me being a pessimist. \n\nFurthermore, what do you think about adding computational metrics, in order to differentiate yourself from the millions of other similar investment sites. Everyone has volume, neat graphs, PE, but to set yourself apart I'd consider other metrics like DCF, or RFR etc. This is something I've been considering doing, but hey give it a shot as well. Zoom-able graph feature would be nice, or pulling up specific time periods. Additionally, something I really like about [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) is they add little bubbles which contain descriptions of what made the stock jump at that time. \n\nI would also consider the ability to change the stocks you can compare your stock to. As far as I've noticed, you can only compare to the FB GOOG GOOGL etc. Maybe I'm just not seeing the button that lets me change them though. \n\nYour Earnings chart is sweet, I like that aspect of your page when reviewing a stock, makes tracking the cash flow much easier, bravo. Take it a step farther, let people track any aspect from a 10K/Q by choosing the category they wish to track. Let them compile all their data onto one graph. (This would be awesome). Ex: Net Income, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, Net Cash Used In Financing, etc. etc. Imagine all those on one graph would be pretttttttty cool imo.\n\nPerhaps some reasoning behind your Analysts pie chart would be nice. As of right now it comes off a little under analyzed. Not willing to trust a circle that doesn't at least explain why it is so. \n\nHope you take CnC well, enjoy.

In the case of Apple, I would argue that they are still fairly valued. It's an incredible deal for a real investor. Why not small cap substitutes? Because of the fact that they are often less stable and prone to higher degrees of speculation and therefore risk. That's not to say they're horrible investments, but if you gave me the choice between buying Apple and Small Cap Corp. XYZ today, I know damn well where I'd put my money, without even delving into the all the reasons why Apple is a great investment. By comparison to these small cap companies, I'd say the same about Google and Amazon.\n\nSomething to think about: try going a day without seeing, hearing about, interacting with a product or service from Apple, Google, or Amazon.
