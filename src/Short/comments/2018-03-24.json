I don\u2019t have any money in them myself besides whatever little parts of my index funds holds them but have been watching them closely for awhile now. To be frank, the company is an absolute train wreck.\n\nGE has a well established brand name, vast resources, incredible production lines, and all the tools needed to be a successful company. Yet poor management, comical accounting, and basically choosing the opposite path of the road they should be on has led them into the disaster of a company they are today. They basically admitted their books were all wrong so you can\u2019t even truly go off their own financial figures when looking the company. They managed to underperform during one of the longest bull markets in recent history. They have issues with their pensions for their employees and have cut their dividends down. They continue to get into sectors they have no business being in rather than focusing on and improving their bread and butter. There\u2019s so many god damn issues with this company, it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere is no denying that there is a lot of potential in GE and a good way to describe them is as a sleeping giant. However, we\u2019ve been saying this for a decade now and year after year they continue to fail and underperform. Will they finally find a management team and the right leaders to get them back on track and in the right direction? If the last decade is any indication, probably not. At some point, GE is going to reach a point where it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re there yet but they\u2019re getting close. If this company can\u2019t do it in a bull market, what\u2019s going to happen during a bear market or crash?\n\nTo sum it all up, GE has the foundation and potential to be a great pick for any portfolio at the price it\u2019s selling at right now. This makes it very tempting but I can\u2019t stress how this company continues to fail year after year.
