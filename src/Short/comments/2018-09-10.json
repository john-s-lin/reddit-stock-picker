Usually before going in to be taken for a ride by the dealer, the car buyer does homework to figure out what price to offer for the car.  The buyer's offer can be confused by option packages and service plans that cost more. The dealers tend to play a lot of games to manipulate buyers especially if they don't have people skills or know the value of the car and options.  Probably car buyers play a lot of games as well.  Some dealers have web sites, but they steer you into going to a dealer.\n\nIn looking around, I found that Carvana and Carmax.com online sell only USED CARS and have them delivered.  They also buy and pick up trade-ins.  The web site has information about the car and pictures and ways to view the car. They have financing options and warranties.  They have a policy that the buyer maybe able to return the car and have it picked up within five days or so if the buyer don't like the car.\n\nAlthough another online company, cars.com, apparently sells the online car shoppers to dealers.  It seems they help buyers get information, yet I'd guess they somehow get the buyers phone number or email and then the buyer finds a bunch of dealers telephoning them or spamming them with junk email. This is why a car buyers in the USA should get information about the pricing of the car some place other then the dealer or web site they buy the car from.\n\nThere also are auction web sites such as copart.com that does online auctions and vehicle marketing. I'm not sure if this is wholesale or for dealers or car used parts dealers or if individuals can sell or buy a car through them.\n", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 190, "submission_ratio": 0.005263157894736842, "submission_title": "Will Amazon.com start selling new cars?", "submission_text": "Amazon.com should start selling new cars.

This implies that the company has a lot of room to grow locally and internationally. \n\nThe company is also significantly growing the number of Amazon Go stores in the US. This development offers retail growth potential beyond that of online retail. \n\nLooking at other areas of business, Amazon's AWS offering is clearly a leader in the cloud technology space and has solidified its position in a highly capital intensive business with few strong competitors and a fast growing market. The rise of IoT, Artificial intelligence and autonomy is causing exponential growth in the demand for data storage and analysis with cloud computing services as the key bemeficiaries. This arm of the business definitely will definitely be a key driver for growth in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to content, Amazon is lagging behind Netflix in terms of content and user experience, but it's definitely putting up a fight and Amazon Prime overall has proven to be hugely successful. As chord cutting continues and streaming takes over as the primary medium for video consumption Amazon will also be well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. A much more promising Amazon subsidiary that's shaking up the online video streaming industry is Twitch, a video streaming platform focused on e-sports. The massive growth in this space led by games such as Fortinite, PUBG and League of Legends  has made Twitch a highly successful investment. \n\nAmazon is currently exploring multiple sectors and markets to penetrate in the near future. The company has built investor confidence over the past twenty years and has managed to maintain its status as a growth based investment even as its market cap hits 1 trillion USD. Also, it's newly achieved market cap will probably lead many, like yourself, to doubt it's ability to grow beyond this number. This might possibly lead to a slight sell off and a better valuation for new investors. \n\nKeep in mind 1 trillion is just a number and while it's not something to ignore it's definitely not something to base investment decisions on. \n\n", "score": 129, "num_replies": 9, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 89, "submission_ratio": 1.449438202247191, "submission_title": "SeekingAlpha: The Risk/Reward Of Owning A $1 Trillion Amazon Is Terrible", "submission_text": "[http://www.thefinancist.com/results\\_article/?article\\_id=5231410544192262](http://www.thefinancist.com/results_article/?article_id=5231410544192262)\n\n## Summary\n\nAmazon has been in an extended bull market for nearly two decades.\n\nExtended bull markets obscure logic, causing price and value to become irrelevant as investors chase momentum.\n\nCongratulations to Amazon bulls on your successes so far, but to actually buy AMZN stock at a $1 trillion valuation makes absolutely no sense.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nthoughts?", "parent_text": "SeekingAlpha: The Risk/Reward Of Owning A $1 Trillion Amazon Is Terrible [http://www.thefinancist.com/results\\_article/?article\\_id=5231410544192262](http://www.thefinancist.com/results_article/?article_id=5231410544192262)\n\n## Summary\n\nAmazon has been in an extended bull market for nearly two decades.\n\nExtended bull markets obscure logic, causing price and value to become irrelevant as investors chase momentum.\n\nCongratulations to Amazon bulls on your successes so far, but to actually buy AMZN stock at a $1 trillion valuation makes absolutely no sense.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nthoughts?", "parent_score": 89, "parent_ratio": 1.449438202247191}, {"time": 1536584228.0, "submission_id": "9ekz2r", "comment_id": "e5pxzeg", "body": "I'm in the military and on my third deployment since 2012.

An investor todsy needs to believe that AWS will continue to grow at roughly the same pace it is currently at (40% yoy) to maintain its current valuation. All of the new ventures are speculative, lower margin endeavors, that should not be rewarded so excessively yet (amazon starts and fails at plenty of projects). \n\nI also, personally, believe there is material risk of regulation for amazon on a monopolistic level. It is no secret that aws subsidizes the other divisions at amazon, and intentionally operating at a loss in order to put your competitors out of business is against the law. Forays into the Brick and Mortar grocery space will exacerbate these issues, as people need food, and grocery stores going out of business will be a major red-flag for politicians. \n\nI like amazon as a company, and use a metric ass load of their services, but I think the company is both spread out too think, and far too richly valued for new money right now.

(50k +6%) (minus fees/commision) Is this a horribly risky thing to do?\n* Was the dive in price related to Musk smoking a blunt on Joe Rogan's podcast? I often see stocks take a big dive after something dramatic happens, and usually inevitably make-up the price loss over a week. Is it a common strategy to sell/trade stocks on this pattern? I don't know much about the stock market, but obviously you wanna buy a stock cheaper so aren't these dramatic moments almost always a great time to snatch up stock despite the marketing showing a lack of confidence?\n\nThank-you!
