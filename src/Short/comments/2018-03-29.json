I am a financial advisor myself, which is the career that evolved from \"stock brokers\". See we live in an age where you can pick up your computer, tablet, or even cell phone and place trades or even purchase options contracts instantly. There isn't a need to broker a trade, what you get from a financial advisor is advice- which often times you are not allowed to give.\n\nSee financial services have been plagued by so many scum bags it's almost impossible provide your clients a unique service. We can't have our own opinions, create our own research or analysis, or put our clients funds into much else besides the structured products we offer. Essentially you are an expensive middle man for the real talent who are the portfolio managers making cookie cutter mutual funds consisting of low cost etfs that generate little to no Alpha. On the other hand, if you have a wealthy enough client (several million) you can get a custom managed account set up for them which is essentially an expensive custom mutual fund strategy with specific exclusions (ie. the client isn't allowed to own certain securities).\n\nTo break that down for you, essentially as a \"broker\"/\"advisor\", you are a middleman (read: salesman) who charges .7-3% on the assets your manage for your clients, with the only value you really add being your annual \"reviews\" where you essentially make sure they still fall under the same risk tolerance as before, and move them into a different cookie cutter strategy. Often times you are forced to stand out by effectively bribing the clients with a fancy experience in your \"office\" like a catered in meal, fancy menu of complimentary drinks, and your own personal friendship.\n\nNot to mention you don't even make that much from your high expense ratio. Let's say you have a $500,000 client and you charge him .5%, he's paying $2,500 per year. Well, as a new advisor you're likely only collecting 20%-30% of that, but let's say 40% and you have $1,000. This means per month this client gets you $83 pre-tax. You'd need 50 of these accounts to make 50k. So reasonably you'd have to charge at least 1.25% for it to even be worth it for you so $6250 annual client cost, $2500 annual revenue, $208 monthly, and 20 accounts for 50k.\n\nNow here's the clincher. Their \"strategy\" (cookie cutter structured product) likely has an expense ratio of about .5-1%. If it's moderately conservative it's likely underperforming the S&P to adjust for the lower risk which has an average return of  11%, annualized to 9.8%, and about 7% accounting for inflation. Let's use a beta of .9 so only 90% of these returns are being captured- 11%*.9, 9.8%*.9, etc.- comes to 9.9% average, 8.82% annualized, 6.3%, inflation adjusted. Net your fees that (1.25%) and the expense ration (.5%), means they could be making as little as 4.55%. The majority of \"self-made\" men and women who are didn't inherit the money (and likely an advisor) will review the numbers and realize these margins are not good and that what you offer isn't that unique. Perhaps you can prey on the older folks who aren't savvy enough to invest monthly sums into an index fund, but even they are likely to work with low cost \"advisors\" in call centers at Fidelity or a credit union.\n\nMy advice- understand that being an engineer and understanding math is helpful, but if you want to be employed for using advanced trading strategies then study computer science and coding. You'll be able to find employment with a quantitate strategy alternative fund writing trading algorithms and you'll be comped handsomely.\n\nAlternatively get very good at hedging strategies and speculative trades, get your MBA or CFA and find employment at a hedge fund as a trader or at a boutique trading desk (rare these days). Final conclusion, don't be a broker.\n\nEDIT: I do not believe I will continue to stay in this field.

Recommendation? experience?", "parent_text": "No offense, but it sounds like you have a long way to go before you even get to a point where you adequately understand the industry. I am a financial advisor myself, which is the career that evolved from \"stock brokers\". See we live in an age where you can pick up your computer, tablet, or even cell phone and place trades or even purchase options contracts instantly. There isn't a need to broker a trade, what you get from a financial advisor is advice- which often times you are not allowed to give.\n\nSee financial services have been plagued by so many scum bags it's almost impossible provide your clients a unique service. We can't have our own opinions, create our own research or analysis, or put our clients funds into much else besides the structured products we offer. Essentially you are an expensive middle man for the real talent who are the portfolio managers making cookie cutter mutual funds consisting of low cost etfs that generate little to no Alpha. On the other hand, if you have a wealthy enough client (several million) you can get a custom managed account set up for them which is essentially an expensive custom mutual fund strategy with specific exclusions (ie. the client isn't allowed to own certain securities).\n\nTo break that down for you, essentially as a \"broker\"/\"advisor\", you are a middleman (read: salesman) who charges .7-3% on the assets your manage for your clients, with the only value you really add being your annual \"reviews\" where you essentially make sure they still fall under the same risk tolerance as before, and move them into a different cookie cutter strategy. Often times you are forced to stand out by effectively bribing the clients with a fancy experience in your \"office\" like a catered in meal, fancy menu of complimentary drinks, and your own personal friendship.\n\nNot to mention you don't even make that much from your high expense ratio. Let's say you have a $500,000 client and you charge him .5%, he's paying $2,500 per year. Well, as a new advisor you're likely only collecting 20%-30% of that, but let's say 40% and you have $1,000. This means per month this client gets you $83 pre-tax. You'd need 50 of these accounts to make 50k. So reasonably you'd have to charge at least 1.25% for it to even be worth it for you so $6250 annual client cost, $2500 annual revenue, $208 monthly, and 20 accounts for 50k.\n\nNow here's the clincher. Their \"strategy\" (cookie cutter structured product) likely has an expense ratio of about .5-1%. If it's moderately conservative it's likely underperforming the S&P to adjust for the lower risk which has an average return of  11%, annualized to 9.8%, and about 7% accounting for inflation. Let's use a beta of .9 so only 90% of these returns are being captured- 11%*.9, 9.8%*.9, etc.- comes to 9.9% average, 8.82% annualized, 6.3%, inflation adjusted. Net your fees that (1.25%) and the expense ration (.5%), means they could be making as little as 4.55%. The majority of \"self-made\" men and women who are didn't inherit the money (and likely an advisor) will review the numbers and realize these margins are not good and that what you offer isn't that unique. Perhaps you can prey on the older folks who aren't savvy enough to invest monthly sums into an index fund, but even they are likely to work with low cost \"advisors\" in call centers at Fidelity or a credit union.\n\nMy advice- understand that being an engineer and understanding math is helpful, but if you want to be employed for using advanced trading strategies then study computer science and coding. You'll be able to find employment with a quantitate strategy alternative fund writing trading algorithms and you'll be comped handsomely.\n\nAlternatively get very good at hedging strategies and speculative trades, get your MBA or CFA and find employment at a hedge fund as a trader or at a boutique trading desk (rare these days). Final conclusion, don't be a broker.\n\nEDIT: I do not believe I will continue to stay in this field.

Recommendation? experience?", "parent_text": "I can\u2019t say that it hasn\u2019t changed, but when I entered college 12 years ago, less than a third of graduates in America went into a field related to their major. This includes education and engineering, which I would bet would be very high proportions and happened to be the most popular jobs for college grads at the time. \n\nOf the finance people I know (not specifically stock brokers): lots of engineering majors, some computer science, lots of econ majors, a classics major, and more that are other random stuff or I just don\u2019t know. \n\nI recommend knowing why you\u2019re going to college for before you get there so you can make the most of it. Engineering, especially something like industrial engineering has the perk of leading to a lot of high paying jobs related to the degree. At the vast majority of schools, it has the drawback of being more like a trade school in that you get very little education outside of engineering. There just isn\u2019t the time. \n\nI didn\u2019t go to college to get a certain job. I went to learn. I majored in economics, which only required about 14 courses out of 32 to graduate. That gave me the chance to take courses in about ten other departments. In fact, I went to college thinking I wanted to study physics which I did, but I fell in love with economics after trying a course and majored in that instead. Had I studied engineering at my school, I\u2019d have never had the chance to try more than one non major course per year. (Obviously not every school is this narrow).

Their chosen index(es) is/are almost always some variation of the S&P500,  total market, or total world. As more people follow this same strategy or some variation thereof, price discovery starts to decay since there's a price-insensitive bid for *everything*. \n\nThink about it like this: \n\nLet's say you and 9 of your friends are the only people allowed to buy stocks in the some made up country. This country only has 100 publicly traded companies. At first, each of you decides to invest in a different way: 2 or 3 of you are trading on fundamentals, 2 or 3 are trading on the subsequent momentum, 2 or 3 are using a technical contrarian strategy, etc. At the end of the day, with this many different strategies at play, there will be volatility as people move around, but the mean reversion will be towards the price required by the buy and hold people to hold the stock. If it dips below where they will buy and hold, they'll buy more and push the price up. If it rises above, they'll sell and push it back down. \n\nBut let's say you all decide that you just want to buy the index of all 100 companies and dollar cost average. Movement between strategies (and therefore stocks) will diminish, reducing volatility. You'll see that your market has lower volatility than it used to and returns are great, so you keep doing the buy and hold and DCA thing since it's working great. All of you are happy. But there's a problem--without the buy and hold guys that *used* to look at each company to determine what the mean reversion price should be (although they would consider it the intrinsic value), everyone's just buying everything. One of the companies in the 100 could be doing something really stupid, but you're not going to pay attention because you're diversified between all 100 companies so that one doesn't hurt you much. Since you don't really mind, you're not going to short that stock, and since it's part of the index, you're actually going to *keep buying more*. \n\nThis all works fine as long as *most* of the companies are growing and doing well, which you could say is an extension of the overall economy of your made-up country doing well. But what happens when there is an economic contraction and instead of 1 out 100 companies with slowing/shrinking earnings, you have 20, or 30, or even 50? Your options are to be long the index and short the bad apples or just sell the index. Most would choose to sell the index since it's easier and less risky. Now, instead of those 99 good companies holding up that 1 bad company, you have those 20-30 bad companies dragging down the 70-80 good ones. Where there used to be a price-insensitive *bid* even for bad companies, now there will be a price-insensitive *ask* even for good companies. \n\nI took the long way around but my point was that it's possible that the rise of passive investing and the availability of cheap ETFs and funds has created a market where price-discovery is broken. **IF** I'm correct in thinking that (which we won't know until we hit the next bear market, I guess), that would mean that it's also possible that price-discovery will be broken on the way down and the next bear market could be deeper than a run-of-the-mill bear. For example, high correlation and low volatility became normalcy in 2017, and volatility mean-reverted in 2018 but correlation has not. Normally, you would expect high vol to lead to low(er) correlation since quality stocks would retain their prices, at least relative to zombie stocks. But the past two months have shown us that correlation is staying, at least for now, so quality or not, stocks will move together.\n\nI could be wrong about all of this obviously, but this is the lens I'm looking through for my own account right now. I'm just uncomfortable with what you realized with your post here--when I can tell you how all of my positions are doing on a given day just by looking at the P/L of my entire account for that day, there's something wrong. \n\nSorry I droned on, I figured I'd put my thoughts in writing and set a reminder so I could come back to this during the next bear market and see where I was right/wrong.

This country only has 100 publicly traded companies. At first, each of you decides to invest in a different way: 2 or 3 of you are trading on fundamentals, 2 or 3 are trading on the subsequent momentum, 2 or 3 are using a technical contrarian strategy, etc. At the end of the day, with this many different strategies at play, there will be volatility as people move around, but the mean reversion will be towards the price required by the buy and hold people to hold the stock. If it dips below where they will buy and hold, they'll buy more and push the price up. If it rises above, they'll sell and push it back down. \n\nBut let's say you all decide that you just want to buy the index of all 100 companies and dollar cost average. Movement between strategies (and therefore stocks) will diminish, reducing volatility. You'll see that your market has lower volatility than it used to and returns are great, so you keep doing the buy and hold and DCA thing since it's working great. All of you are happy. But there's a problem--without the buy and hold guys that *used* to look at each company to determine what the mean reversion price should be (although they would consider it the intrinsic value), everyone's just buying everything. One of the companies in the 100 could be doing something really stupid, but you're not going to pay attention because you're diversified between all 100 companies so that one doesn't hurt you much. Since you don't really mind, you're not going to short that stock, and since it's part of the index, you're actually going to *keep buying more*. \n\nThis all works fine as long as *most* of the companies are growing and doing well, which you could say is an extension of the overall economy of your made-up country doing well. But what happens when there is an economic contraction and instead of 1 out 100 companies with slowing/shrinking earnings, you have 20, or 30, or even 50? Your options are to be long the index and short the bad apples or just sell the index. Most would choose to sell the index since it's easier and less risky. Now, instead of those 99 good companies holding up that 1 bad company, you have those 20-30 bad companies dragging down the 70-80 good ones. Where there used to be a price-insensitive *bid* even for bad companies, now there will be a price-insensitive *ask* even for good companies. \n\nI took the long way around but my point was that it's possible that the rise of passive investing and the availability of cheap ETFs and funds has created a market where price-discovery is broken. **IF** I'm correct in thinking that (which we won't know until we hit the next bear market, I guess), that would mean that it's also possible that price-discovery will be broken on the way down and the next bear market could be deeper than a run-of-the-mill bear. For example, high correlation and low volatility became normalcy in 2017, and volatility mean-reverted in 2018 but correlation has not. Normally, you would expect high vol to lead to low(er) correlation since quality stocks would retain their prices, at least relative to zombie stocks. But the past two months have shown us that correlation is staying, at least for now, so quality or not, stocks will move together.\n\nI could be wrong about all of this obviously, but this is the lens I'm looking through for my own account right now. I'm just uncomfortable with what you realized with your post here--when I can tell you how all of my positions are doing on a given day just by looking at the P/L of my entire account for that day, there's something wrong. \n\nSorry I droned on, I figured I'd put my thoughts in writing and set a reminder so I could come back to this during the next bear market and see where I was right/wrong.

Remember, this is a derivative contract. It is its own product, and trades separately from the stock, but the value is derived from the value of the stock price.\n\nFB, Jan 2019 expiration, $200 strike call option.\n\nLike any contract, there are two sides to this option contract, the buyer and the seller (aka the writer). Upon creation of the contract (or opening) a *call* option gives the buyer of the option contract the *right* to buy 100 shares of FB for $200/share on or before 1/18/19. The seller is granting the buyer this option, per the contract, and as such, is obligated to sell those shares to the buyer at that price if the buyer chooses to exercise this contract. The seller of the call is granting the buyer with that right because the buyer is paying them some amount (premium) for this right. That amount, which is determined by the open market, is the value of the contract. For this particular option contract, the last trade was $6.00. The pricing is stated on a *per share* basis, so in reality the last transaction for this contract was $600. The buyer paid $600 for the right to buy 100 shares of FB from the seller on or before 1/18/19. The seller collected $600 in cash for allowing the buyer to have that right. If a different seller would have given up the right for $550, the buyer would have gone to that seller instead. This covers opening a contract. We will now talk about holding, and closing a contract. \n\nOnce the contract is written (buyer has bought to open, seller has sold to open), the value will change over time. If FB goes up $50/sh tomorrow, obviously having the right to buy shares for $200 at any time this year is going to be worth a lot more than that right was today. The option market will re-price this contract accordingly. The value of an option contract is the sum of two parts, intrinsic value and time value. An out of the money option has no intrinsic value because there is no value in exercising the contract. Buying shares for $200 instead of on the open market for $160 has no value. If FB went up to $210, the intrinsic value of the option would be $10/share. Time value is trickier to figure out, and that's where the greek symbols come into play. At a basic level, more time remaining on the contract is more valuable because is gives the stock more time to go higher which creates more intrinsic value. At expiration, time value is 0 so intrinsic value is all that matters at that point. But in the interim, they both add up to price the option. AT ANY TIME, either the seller or the buyer or both can close the contract on the market with any other seller or buyer of the same contract. If I am the buyer and I paid $600 to buy and open and tomorrow the market is valuing the option at $700, I can sell to close and make $100 in profit and never touch any FB stock. If I am the seller and I sold to open, I could decide I don't want to be obligated potentially sell those shares in the future and I can buy to close and lose $100. The vast majority of the time, this is how contracts end, rather than exercising. That should cover the pre-expiration transactions, let's fast forward to expiration to understand what sort of liabilities each party has.\n\nAt expiration in Jan 2019, let's say FB has indeed gone up to $210. At 3:59pm Eastern Time, the time value of the option is $0, the intrinsic value of the option is $10. The buyer can either sell to close for $1000 total and profit $400, or exercise the option. If he exercises, he sends $20,000 to the seller and receives 100 shares. If he doesn't have $20,000 in his account in cash or margin, he wants to make sure he sells to close rather than trying to exercise. He might have to sell to close for a few bucks less than intrinsic value, but that's negligible. Otherwise he can exercise, and get the shares. He would pay $20,000 on top of the $600 he paid to open the contract, so his cost basis will be $206/share. He can sell those shares on the market for $210 and make that same $400 profit, or just hold. So the buyer is in a good spot.\n\nThe seller is more interesting. If the option is out of the money, the contract won't be exercised and the seller just keeps the $600 cash and no longer has any obligation. If it is in the money, they have to either buy to close or fulfill the contract by selling shares. At $210, they can buy to close for that same $1000 and lose $400. Or they can wait for it to be exercised. $20,000 would go into their account and 100 shares of FB would go out. If they bought the 100 shares for $160, no big deal, they still made $4,000 on those shares, plus the $600 premium. Equivalent to selling shares for $206. If FB went to $400, still no big deal, they just made a lot less money than they would have had they not sold the call. Owning the underlying shares is selling a *covered* call. Now, if they don't own the shares, but sold the call anyway, that is selling a *naked* call and that's where it gets dicey. Say the seller assumed FB was trash and would never go above $200. Easy $600, right? Sure, if that's true. But if FB goes to $400, the seller would have to buy $40,000 worth of FB shares, but they are only getting $20,000 in cash from the option contract buyer, so they lose $20,000. Bummer.

Puts are similar, but instead of granting the right to buy shares at a certain price, a put option contract grants the buyer with the right to sell shares at a certain price. For the seller, the liability is buying those shares regardless of what the market price of the stock is.\n\nLet's say I sold a naked FB 1/18/19 $125 put option for $5. If FB goes to $50/share, if I did not buy to close I would need to pay the buyer $12,500 for 100 shares which I could then only sell to the market for $5,000. I originally took in $500 as a premium when I sold the contract, so I lost $7,000. If FB only goes down to $130, or stays the same, or goes up, the option is out of the money and expires worthless. I keep that $500.  \n\nAs the seller, to be selling a covered put is much safer (as opposed to naked), but confusing. You cover a sold put with short shares of a stock. Shorting is borrowing shares of a stock, and then selling them into the market to buy back later at a cheaper price. If you short 100 shares of FB at $160, you have $16,000 cash in your account and pay some interest on the shares you borrowed to sell. If FB does go down to $50 and you are obligated to buy 100 shares at $125 because of the put you sold, you have $16,000 in cash from your short that you can use to buy those shares, so you are covered. You buy the shares for $12,500 and then you return those 100 shares you now own because you previously borrowed 100 shares. All the trades are done and you have $3,500 more in cash than when you began. If you had no sold the put, you could have bought the 100 shares you shorted back fro $5,000 instead of $12,500 and you would have made $11,000 instead of $3,500. But let's say FB doesn't go to $50, it goes to $130. Short + sold put would net you $3,000 + $500 where as shorting alone would have netted you only $3,000. If FB goes up to $180 and you want to close your short, you lost $2,000 on the short but still made $500 on the sold put, so only $1,500 loss instead of $2,000 had you not sold the put. So selling a covered put on top of a short position limits your max gain in exchange for a premium, juts like selling a covered call does for a long position.

Bonds typically have a fixed rate (coupon rate) and are issued at par value. They can be held to maturity at which time you\u2019d receive your principal investment amount back.
