However, the money will come a lot faster if you pursue those two things instead of money.  And in a big city, you will find more capitalist and entrepreneurs.  You'll have more opportunities.\n2. Advance your job.  Constantly look for a new job that offers better pay and position.  This is fastest way to make money.  A new job can bring in thousands more a month, which you can use to increase our investing capital.  And with the law of compounding, you'll get rich faster.

Since I early graduated from high school I don't have much to do a T the moment so I said I'd run it. The idea is to roll dice every day for the stocks to go up or down, we invest in stocks like a normal market and then we take out our money on poker night (with maximum buy-in for playing) to play with, then at the end od the night we re-invest it.\n\nThis creates long-term effects and creates consequences for playing poorly, thus creating stakes without using real money, but still has value as simulated money.\n\nWe also have a loan system that's between each other but I'm not too worried about that.\n\n_____________\n\nSo what I'm here to ask is for some input on my current system.\n\nI'm thinking I generate a random number between 1 and 4 - this determines how many dice will be rolled for each side (up and down) per stock, that amount of dice is rolled and then subtracted from the others, for example, say the green dice up is a 5 and down is 3, so the total would be 2, this is done for all dice and then the totals are split up with the highest being paired with the lowest and the second highest being paired with the 3rd highest, those dice are done with normal subtraction from the largest number and then those numbers are again subtracted from each other with the highest (or added if simulations show the number is always very negative). This will give us a number and that will be how much the stock is going up or down - if it is over 3.5(?) then it will be turned into a decimal.\n\nIf a stock has gone up the previous day one die will be added to the positive side and to the negative if it has gone down, this creates the ability for trends to form so its not completely random.\n\n____________\n\nI don't know how this will perform without running some simulations and obviously I will refine it as needed, but I wanted to get the advice from some people who watch the real market to see what you all thought about how well this simulated an actual stock market but on a quicker and more volitile scale so that way money can be made and lost within 1 or 2 weeks so poker night changes a bit and poeple with little money and make more to use and then gain during poker and roulette.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading and I'd love to hear all thoughts!", "parent_text": "Coming in abit late... (am searching for poker night 2 steam keys lol),\n\nI think this stock market thing is abit.... elaborate. If someone bankrupts, being friends, wont you guys just chip them in again? \n\nThe problem you have is lack of scarcity of \u00a4 credit. So you need to artificially make one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Everyone gets \u00a41000 credits upon joining. Every official sanctioned game they attend, add \u00a4200 to their \"wallet\".\n\n2) Have a limited buy in. I'm not sure how you are playing roulette in a no-gambling place, but assuming its poker, lets say the buy in is \u00a4500 with a \u00a4250 rebuy option.\n\n3) Have a tax. Assuming you have 6 buddies, thats an inflation of \u00a41200 from \u00a46000 therefore a 20% inflation. So a house rake of 2-5% *(which the host doesnt take, it is a economic tax)* on the pot would balance the economy. Some maths would be needed to be sure.\n\n4) Have no other way to gain \u00a4X or it will be about who has the largest bank account or begs the best.\n\n4.5) Loser clears the table, tidies the cards/chips/table, washes the dishes, throws the trash. The rest can straight on to watch tv with beer n shit.\n\n4.5.5) If they do a good job, as determined by the host, they get another entry bonus of \u00a4200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow about 2, you would note the first night they cant spend their whole bankroll. Like real life, one should keep some cash spare for the next day not gamble it all. Someone would have to lose twice in a row to totally clear their bankroll. \n\nActual number of \u00a4 credits is up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "parent_score": 1, "parent_ratio": 1.0}, {"time": 1547411198.0, "submission_id": "afettj", "comment_id": "ee00sdr", "body": "We have - but we also want to have fun and introduce stakes to an otherwise mundane poker game.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 1.0, "submission_title": "Creating a Fake Stock Market", "submission_text": "Howdy everyone!

I think about the company and the product, is it good, would I use it, and will others use it.  I think about what I use at work.  I look at the market cap to determine if it's worth that amount and is there room to grow.  I check P/E if the company has been around long enough.  I started near the end of 2017, so real results are TBD, but this led to some interesting results so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some I've purchased:**\n\n**MDB** (MongoDB) - Used this for about five years now.  I've gone to most of the MongoDB World conferences and have been in their offices.  Once I heard they IPO'd I jumped in at an average cost of around $30.  Since they've gone up so much I've sold some.\n\n**SNAP** (SnapChat) - I compared the market cap and thought about number of users and how active it is.  I bought in at $14 a share.  Clearly, this did not work out for me.\n\n**AMD** \\- Intel has been having issues since the end of 2015 and more recently AMD has been stepping up their game.  Considering that and a comparison of their market caps it feels like AMD should have a larger slice of the pie.  I entered this when AMD was ranging between $10-$14 in the end of 2017.\n\n**ETSY** \\- Used this for wedding supplies and liked the platform.  The market cap seemed low for what it is and how well known it was.  I got lucky with the management shake-up.  I got in at $17 a share and have since sold the profits to maintain my original equity amount.\n\n**TSLA** \\- Not many people/companies innovate on large engineering projects.  Buying the man as much as buying the company.  Long-term play.  Risk/reward profile fully accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some I've avoided:**\n\n**ESTC** (Elastic) - I've used this some and wanted it at a market cap of $2b.  By the time I had a chance to buy it, it's market cap was $5b.  I compare this to Red Hat's market cap and think about how long Red Hat has been around and their current P/E.\n\n**NVDA** (Nvidia) - They make great video cards.  Their market cap is too high for what they are.  Glad I avoided this.  They are messing up with their current gen GPUs as they're overpriced and released late.  I would've bought an Nvidia GPU over Christmas break if there was one worth buying.  I've ranted about this on my [personal blog](https://codelie.com/2018/08/20/nvidia-rtx-2080-looking-fast-and-expensive/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to let me know your thoughts.", "score": 3, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 9, "submission_ratio": 0.3333333333333333, "submission_title": "Let\u2019s talk strategy", "submission_text": "What are the first things you look at when accessing a stock?
