This really seems like an overhyped article that pitches a heavy headline, but by the end curves into a bizarre \"what if\" situation and then continues contradict it's initial statement by providing likely alternatives to the fund just shutting down. \n\n**Immediately after they talk about the fund potentially shutting down they acknowledge it would be a radical move. It's less than likely, but possible.**\n\n>It\u2019s a big \u201cif\u2019\u2019 -- custodians tend to be in it for the long haul -- but U.S. Bancorp is actively reviewing whether it will remain the fund\u2019s custodian...\n\n**Shareholders would also have a 90 day notice of the shut down and the remaining funds would be distributed amongst shareholders**\n\n>Custodians are typically allowed to terminate their contract with an ETF issuer after a notice period of about 90 days, depending on their agreement. Minus a custodian -- a legal requirement under the Investment Company Act of 1940 -- a fund\u2019s board would be pushed to liquidate the ETF, with shareholders splitting the proceeds.\n\n**And they go on to note that this end up being nothing or that an alternative custodian (there's already one doing this in Canada) could pick up where U.S. Bank leaves off**\n\n>Of course, U.S. Bank could decide in favor of ETFMG. Or another custodian could step in. CIBC Mellon Trust has custody of the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF in Canada, where weed will become legal for recreational use later this year.\n\n**Not to mention, they could even custodian themselves...**\n\n>Technically, ETFMG could even decide to be custodian for the fund itself, although that route is subject to strict rules and surprise audits that lawyers say make it almost untenable for most providers.\n\n**And finally they state the obvious. It's all about the $$$ and Cannabis is green to begin with, who's gonna just let this ETF disappear?**\n\n>What\u2019s clear is that there\u2019s a lot of money at stake -- for investors, for the manager and for a custodian.

It will help get a better feel and understanding of the company. They had a great idea and make good products but they just have so many flaws and problems that are unlikely to improve or go away.\n\nFor example, their products are rather unique and basically something you buy only once or maybe every 5-10 years. The technology and product simply doesn\u2019t improve or change considerably fast enough. People may be happy with their products but they\u2019re not buying multiple GoPros or buying one every year or so like people do with iPhones.\n\nAnother issue they have is that they really haven\u2019t expanded their products either. It\u2019s good to stick to your bread and butter but you also have to provide an edge over your competitors once they catch up. There are now several companies out there now offering similar products with some better made, some cheaper, or both. I can\u2019t really think of anything else the company is known for besides their cameras. What has changed these last 5-10 years? What new products do they have on the horizon? Again, do their products change or improve enough to attract consumers to do business with them again after buying their first GoPro?\n\nI also think their products and target market are too niche and small. I can\u2019t really think of anyone else who buys GoPros besides outdoorsy people, extreme sports, and maybe some camera enthusiasts. Is this target base growing or are they expecting a broader target audience? What are they doing to accomplish such things? They tried getting it to the drone market and failed miserably so where else do they look?\n\nTheir financial numbers aren\u2019t impressive either. They missed most expectations and seemed to have underperformed yet again. They\u2019re implementing a subscription based program now which has been met with mixed reviews/opinions. They laid off a couple hundred employees last month and have begun desperately slashing prices hoping to attract customers which will likely influence their numbers as well.\n\nAnother bad sign is that their management has practically all but said they are looking for and waiting for a buy out. To me, this isn\u2019t a sign of confidence by the people who should be most confident in that company. Also, there isn\u2019t really anyone out there right now who\u2019s interested in buying or running them.\n\nGoPro had an awesome idea and actually made a pretty solid product. They just failed to adjust and monetize their product over time and placate themselves in the industry for the long term.

Its niche because you had to be into action sports or relatively extreme activities that needed an action cam. Gopro has/had that market cornered but its shrinking, most people that would get use out of a gopro most likely already own one and dont constantly need to buy the newer model. Also for the general population most recording needs can be met with a decent phone. They dropped the ball by not developing drones and other products sooner, they waited for others to pave the way in things gopro should have dominated. Imagine how easy it would be if say google or apple decided to create a serious action cam gopro would be screwed as the big dogs dominate. Just look how much of an impact the apple watch had on wearables and traditional watches.\n\nThe management at gopro was horrendous, Newman fucked up all time. Products were launched at the wrong time. Business decisions weren't always made in the best interest for gopro. \n\nGopro to me was always an uphill battle. Too niche, and directed at a small demographic. I feel that competitors are taking more market share and gopro can easily be replicated at a lower price. Businesses like action cameras, dlrs cameras, speakers, headphones, and other businesses like that eventually fizzle out.

Here\u2019s the basics of what I do when it comes to stocks:\n\nI find a few companies that I'm familiar with (I will only keep about 5 at a time typically), in an industry I know, that I think have a great future, which is full of potential, and also isn't way overpriced. Each month I put in whatever cash I can afford to invest. I spend maybe 60% or 75% of my available cash on those companies, then monitor their news, earnings, etc. constantly. If I still think those companies have a great future (say 5 years out) based on the ever-changing news, I keep them; otherwise, I sell them and look for better companies. \nAs far as the other 25%-40% of my available funds - I hold those just in case the stocks I've chosen drop. If they drop 10% or more (and I still believe in the company!) I'll buy back in at that lower price. \nIf the stocks go up as planned, then next month I'll add however much more cash I can afford to invest; then have have this month\u2019s cash, plus whatever I didn\u2019t invest from the prior month. I spend 60%-75% of that on whichever of my companies has the best news at that time. If I can\u2019t decide, then I\u2019ll split my funds among all of my stocks, or maybe just hold it until next month.\nI never stress over price much. In the long term the market always goes UP! As long as my companies have a good future (5 years out), price fluctuations in the short term are just noise.\nOh and I stay away from mutual funds completely because I don't think their returns are anywhere near worth the fees that they charge. \nI do pretty well with this methodology, but it's all my opinion; everyone has their own ideas. \n\nGOOD LUCK TO YOU", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Back when I was inexperienced and silly.

There are just too many variables to know what it will do short term.\nAs an investor, Earnings Reports are about the lowest timeline i focus on.  Its a way better indicator than the daily/weekly noise.  And after a few quarterly reports, you have a much better picture of where the company stands and where its headed\nDepending on the stock and their product lines, there are different things to look for.  If its a growth stock like netflix with a huge valuation, then you better see double digit growth or that stock price/valuation will start to drop.\nMy personal rule of thumb for earnings-\nproducts/marketing catching customers and converting them into sales.\n\n Does the company do a good job in turning revenue into profit/earnings.   Is it doing a billion in sales, but only at a 1.2 margin or doing 500 million in sales with a 33% margin\n\n what is the trend year over year, or quarterly.  Are sales and revenue slowly shrinking, or margins getting tight, etc.\n\nGood companies should have improving revenue/margins/etc over 4-12 quarters. you should be able to spot trends.\n\n Lastly look for the future guidance and does it make sense. example-Disney announces its taking content off of netflix and doing their own stream in 2019. How will this effect the stock.\n\nQuarterly reports are much better indicators as opposed to short term- \"Stock X is down 6% this week, should i sell\"  I don't worry about that shit, but if i see apple 2 quarters in a row have shrinking revenue or something like that, then i know its legit and may start to worry and ponder their future.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 0, "submission_ratio": 100, "submission_title": "Back when I was inexperienced and silly.
