The market is a bunch of stocks  with s&p500  average winner of 9% yty but on vanguard asset classes you will see how much it is good for you and your investments there is a bunch of categories like small mid high cap s&p   S&p Aristocrats that outperform s&p with 30% in the last ten years  , if you go for 1000 investment that pays dividends at least my tactic would be tgat one also assume that if the company is strong enough to pay you off calculate price growth vs dividends and in this theme what can hurt dividebds or reverse \n I would suggest read or search about them low price high yield not come off like 80$ pays 0,43 with 800$ you would just get 4,3 in one dividend payment rather than that look in the middle price high dividend based on your cash investment.\n i just found today in the school in about 30 mins that evraz plc has 564 pound annual share but it pays off 30.pounds in dividends so 1000 you will have 60 gbp  in 4x year thats just 240 gbp in a year with a 1000 investment also llok on company history dividends payment . Dont get me wrong do your research invest the time and information in yourself im not in the market i just do research and try to learn about it . \nits not a must do advice its to compare dividend yield overtime price growth but ic somebody does this those have a lot of diversification with 10 stocks that cant beat the market but pays more just of s&p 500 index with 0.19 in 20 years if you invest 1000 monthly you will get some market crashes if you dont rouch it fine just leave it for 24 years for price correction but if a market crashes and your 1.2 mill will lose 600k thats a big yikes if you dont reinvest even in a downfall thats why i said try calculations in the s&p500 if you understand it fully then you can try and discover diversified portfolio that can be at the not so much loss against s&p. \n Feel free to have anybodys comments to reply for me about everything if i see something wrong. I just started it 3 days ago read nearly 3 books so this is what i see with my invested time in it.\n For the evraz  plc  i dont know why some stocks are more pricey rather than in the US with like us company is 1000 uk company is 2000.", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 0.6666666666666666, "submission_title": "Mutual Funds Vs.

We can't sell products anymore\", then it is a big problem.\n\n\n>There is only one reason to hide unit sells. That is declining or slowing unit sale growth.\n\nEvery industry and product eventually reaches a level of maturity. So, the fact that they are hovering around 200 million phone sales per year isn't particularly disturbing to me. Fact is they still are selling a ridiculous amount of phones. And beyond that, demand for smartphones will continue to growth over time, though almost certainly more slowly than it has in the past. \n\nBeyond this, they have been on the cutting edge of integrated digital services for the past decade as well. An area they are clearing growing in and pushing hard. So it isn't just the sale.of the phone itself that makes them money, but they are continuing to make money off of the customers as long as they are using the phone.\n\nI also disagree that this move means that they think phone sales are going to drop or completely stall. I think it has more significance that they believe it is not the most important metric or that it is detracting from the progress they are making in other areas.\n\n>The profit margin game is a losing one in the end. At some point their margin will no longer grow either and will likely shrink as phones become more commodities.\n\nPeople have been saying this for a decade or more for Apple products, and yet they still get away with charging ridiculous amounts for their phones and other devices. \n\nCommunication technology has never just been a commodity, communication as a service certainly could be seen more as such, but not the technology that drives it. And smartphones are clearly much more than just a communication device. They are an integral part of everyday life for most people in many different ways. Until a technology comes along to replace smartphones (whatever that may be), there will always be demand for the newest and greatest and people will eventually need to replace their old devices. Further integration of these devices into different parts of our lives will keep demand up.

Loyal customers. And further, moves like removing the headphone jack and not including dongles in the iPhone box anymore, pushing people to buy AirPods.
