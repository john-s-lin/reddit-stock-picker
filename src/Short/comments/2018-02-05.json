The Nikkei high was back in the 80s so if you started investing in the 80s Nikkei, then you still would not have made that investment back.\n\nTo account for that type of risk, my suggestion is to determine a price level at which you will reduce/close your position and a price level at which you re-open.  Conversely, determine a set of rules where you will get back in.  This way, when the market surprises to the downside, you aren't panicking and making an emotional decision.  The key is to reduce the emotions in your decision making and to reduce subjective decisions.\n\nLet's say, screw it, if the S&P 500 closes below 2200 on a month end basis (which would be one heck of a downside), then you can say I am closing 50% of my SPX position or all of it.  Since you are in the mid-long haul, that kind of downside is not bad.  That way, when the SPX is bouncing around 2400-2500 or below you aren't swayed by that decision.\n\nSuggest starting off with some basic technical analysis and price pivot points to understand support/resistance levels.\n\nThe smaller the timeframe, the more noisy it is.  I would also suggest not staring at hourly or daily charts all the time unless you are a short term/swing trader and want to capture volatility.  Longer term, it is just noise.

See the Japanese stock market.  The Nikkei high was back in the 80s so if you started investing in the 80s Nikkei, then you still would not have made that investment back.\n\nTo account for that type of risk, my suggestion is to determine a price level at which you will reduce/close your position and a price level at which you re-open.  Conversely, determine a set of rules where you will get back in.  This way, when the market surprises to the downside, you aren't panicking and making an emotional decision.  The key is to reduce the emotions in your decision making and to reduce subjective decisions.\n\nLet's say, screw it, if the S&P 500 closes below 2200 on a month end basis (which would be one heck of a downside), then you can say I am closing 50% of my SPX position or all of it.  Since you are in the mid-long haul, that kind of downside is not bad.  That way, when the SPX is bouncing around 2400-2500 or below you aren't swayed by that decision.\n\nSuggest starting off with some basic technical analysis and price pivot points to understand support/resistance levels.\n\nThe smaller the timeframe, the more noisy it is.  I would also suggest not staring at hourly or daily charts all the time unless you are a short term/swing trader and want to capture volatility.  Longer term, it is just noise.  Weekly and monthly charts are where it's at for long term.
