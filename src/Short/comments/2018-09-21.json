Dividends are announced as an actual price and are paid out on a per share basis. Typically the dividends are announced and paid out quarterly, however most sites will be showing the annual dividend amount. \n\nI see you mentioned T in one of your comments. Here is the quarterly dividend announcement from T from June: http://about.att.com/story/att_declares_quarterly_dividend_2018.html. You can see they announced a $0.50 quarterly dividend that is paid out on Aug 1st if you owned the stock as of July 10th. You'll notice on Yahoo Finance for example, they have the dividend listed as $2.00 ($0.50 x 4). You can see their dividend history here: https://investors.att.com/stock-information/historical-stock-information/historical-dividends/att-inc. \n\nT is not 100% guaranteed to announce a $0.50 dividend for Q4 (would be announced around Oct 1st) though it is very likely to be $0.50 in this case. The hope is that the dividend goes up over time, but it's not guaranteed. If for some reason T dropped to $10 per share, I highly doubt they'd keep the $0.50 dividend as that would be a 20% annual dividend and honestly if the price dropped that much, they would probably be better served using that money to improve their business rather than pay out a 20% dividend. There is also the chance they simply won't have the money to keep doing that. On the reverse side, if things go great and T is trading at $60 per share, there is a chance the dividend would increase more than normal and might jump to $0.75 quarterly. This would be a 5% annual yield, but you'd be getting $0.75 per share per quarter rather than $0.50 even though it has a lower yield.\n\nJust for an example if you were still interested, let's say T was trading at $35 per share on July 1st, this means that quarterly dividend has a 1.4% quarterly yield (0.50 / 35.00). You buy 100 shares on July 1st at $35 for a total of $3500. Aug 1st comes around and you get your $50.00 ($0.50 x 100 shares), which is that 1.4% quarterly yield again ($50 / $3500).\n\nI was late to the game however and bought T on July 8th when it was trading at $40 per share. My quarterly yield is 1.2% (0.50 / 40.00). I bought 100 shares at $40 for a total of $4000. Aug 1st comes around and I get my $50.00, which is still a 1.2% quarterly yield ($50 / $4000).\n\nSo in the end we both got $50, but it cost me $4000 to get it and it only cost you $3500 to get it. That is how the yield can be used to compare one stock to another as well as deciding when the dividend for a particular stock is attractive. Independent of the dividend though, you also made $500 on appreciation with the stock going up to $40.
