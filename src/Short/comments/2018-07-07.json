Essentially, all processors are based on an \u201carchitecture\u201d and in that architecture you have what\u2019s called the lithography, which is essentially the node size of a transistor on a processor. The smaller that is, the more efficient it can be (both in power consumption and in executing instructions). AMD is set to have a 7nm lithography in their upcoming processors, while Intel is struggling to manufacture a 10nm that is stable. \u201cnm\u201d being nanometers. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of factors to it and really it\u2019s more complicated than that, but I hope that helps to answer your questions", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 0, "submission_score": 191, "submission_ratio": 0.005235602094240838, "submission_title": "Best stocks to buy now and forget?", "submission_text": "for 5 years?\n\nIn tech niche : which one?\n\nHealthcare :  which one?\n\nDriveless  autos: which one?", "parent_text": "> They\u2019ve taken a small portion of market share in the gaming and productivity side of things (relatively speaking), but they\u2019re just adding a lot of competition that intel didn\u2019t used to have.

Their new generation of CPUs scale incredibly well, so you have chips that don\u2019t consume a lot of (again, relative) power but at the same time are powerful and priced VERY competitively.
