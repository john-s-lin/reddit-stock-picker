They're boring, but reliable. This is a great aspect to have if you like getting a steady income, are ready to retire (because huge market swings won't take a dent out of your retirement investments, etc).\n\nNon dividend paying stocks are re-investing that money into their company, or saving it for investments that will pay off greatly over a short time. However, companies can fail at this and their stock can drop. It's more risky, but with more risk comes more reward. Many investors buy these types of stocks to speculate on breakthroughs or changes in the market.\n\nI'm on board with your plan of dividends that pay out frequently. Monthly sounds pretty cool, especially if you can re-invest those funds or use the monthly payouts to fund a lifestyle. I also like lowering risk.\n\nAnother thing to consider is index funds that are focused on high dividend payouts, as they have more safety embedded inside of them.\n\nThat being said, this advice applies to my perception of the stock market.

This composition contrasts sharply with most other dividend-yield based indices, which tend to be more value-oriented in their holdings and are more heavily weighted toward financial, telecommunication and utility stocks..

I have a 50k acct but with day trading 4:1 leverage I have 200k in day trading buyin power.\n\nMy STRICT rule I do NOT budge on is losses. I ONLY risk $1000 per trade, meaning immediately after placing a trade I set a stop order equal to a $1000 loss. No exceptions!\n\nI do not play the pray and hope game, the second I'm down $1000, I close the trade immediately.\n\nThe next thing is profits. One thing I hate even more than losses is missed profits! Meaning, when I take profits too early and the stock just keeps rising and I leave so much money on the table. \n\nI fixed the problem one simple way. Setting alerts! So when I place a trade, I immediately set an alert on when I am up $1000 on the trade. \n\nOnce I am up $1000 on a trade, instead of taking profits, I set a stop order to close the trade when the stock falls to where I'm up $500.\n\nIf it never falls enough for the stop order to trigger and lock in a $500 profit, I let it ride to the closing bell.\n\nPERFECT example is the SPY trade on Friday. Got the alert when I was up a grand, placed a stop order to close the trade when I'm only up $500, and just left it alone until 3:55 PM.\n\nDidn't take profits too early and as a result made an extra $2500. Alerts are an EXTREMELY important tool I use every day. \n\nReally day trading boils down yo robot like discipline.
