A few comments in here hit it right on the nose and now I realize the assumption I made in error.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Re: Losing out on money from transaction costs** \\--- I'm using Robinhood for this ETF, so commission free trading keeps me from losing money on the trades, which is why I even considered this strategy in the first place, however...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Re: Losing out on money from taxes** \\--- that's a very good point that I hadn't considered. Even before getting to my bunk math later in this post, it is now clear to me that my plan was an ineffective way to accumulate shares, and that I should just stick to buying on dips like a smart person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Re: \"timing the market\" and \"buying high and selling low\"** \\--- the joke is all well and good, but the point of this whole plan was that I wasn't trying to time the market at all, but instead using my profits to add to my position at a target value, regardless of the price trend moving up or down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I thought I had something, but the two below comments zeroed in on my main error in logic:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You forgot that you need to pay the same price for ALL 18 shares- 18 times 32.98 is 593.64.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The point you overlooked is that the price of $41.99 (i.e. the profit that you made from the sale) holds only for buying the 18th share. In order to buy back the remaining 17 shares you would need to buy them at or below the sale price of $32.03. Instead you considered any price below $32.98 as the buy price for all 18 shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**That's exactly what happened...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I saw that if my 17 shares hit a price of $31.50 or higher, then the total value of my shares would be at least $535.50 (17 x 31.50 = 535.5).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If I sold at that point, I would have a profit of $32.98 (535.5 - 502.52 = 32.98)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[My current position was worth $502.52 (17 x avg. cost of 29.56 = 502.52) \\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I ended up selling my position of 17 shares at a price of $32.03 for a total of $544.51. This left me with a profit of $41.99 (even higher than my target profit of $32.98, so I thought I was golden)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut as u/PAdogooder pointed out, *I was only applying that target price to the 18th share* I wanted to buy, not the whole position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **So effectively, the incorrect math I was using was:** (17 x $29.56) + $32.98 \\[or lower, the target price I was using for the 18th share\\] = $535.50 --\"Cool! That's plenty below the amount I made from the sale of my position ($544.51), I'm golden!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When in reality, the math is 18 x $32.98 = $593.64 - well OVER the amount I made from the sale of my position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you all so much** for taking the time to assess my situation and point out my error. It has helped me quite a bit and I can now walk away from this untimely sale with a lesson learned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecial thanks to u/TheAncient1sAnd0s , u/PAdogooder , and u/Crazy-Cat-Gentleman\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.....now I'm just really hoping that price dips below $30.94 again so I can get back on this train and continue to add to my position like I should have been doing in the first place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 2, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 10, "submission_ratio": 0.2, "submission_title": "Please help me find the error/incorrect assumption in my math that led me to Sell prematurely", "submission_text": "Hello all,\n\n\nI'm investing in a stock, and had a plan to sell at a certain price and then re-buy immediately with the profit from that sale paying for an additional share in the same stock.\n\n\nBut I messed up my math somewhere.

Obviously, louis vuitton is first and foremost in people's minds, but there's also the wine/spirits business and Sephora. LVMH is 70 different houses across 6 sectors; I think there's flexibility to continue to evolve over time given the broad view of \"luxury\". I mean, LVMH owns a theme park (https://www.lvmh.com/houses/other-activities/jardin-dacclimatation/)\n\nEVGBX is a particularly unique mutual fund. \"99.4. \u201cActive share\u201d measures the degree to which a fund\u2019s portfolio differs from the holdings of its benchmark portfolio.  High active share indicates management which is providing a portfolio that is substantially different from, and independent of, the index.  An active share of zero indicates perfect overlap with the index, 100 indicates perfect independence. The active share for Evermore is generally near 100, which reflects extreme independence plus the effect of several hedged positions.\" (https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2017/08/evermore-global-value-evgbxevgix-august-2017/)", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}, {"time": 1535574647.0, "submission_id": "9az7bk", "comment_id": "e5227uk", "body": "Thank you - I remember that, and the feelings mutual - I have a short list of people around Reddit where when they speak, I listen, and you're on it.\n\nAlso - glad someone took advantage of that AbbVie dip!

Some examples of what I'm looking for would be the Brown family owning large amounts of Brown-Forman, or the Shoen family and Amerco, or the Herlin family and KONE Oyj.  I'm less interested in companies where a founder owns a large stake in the company, like Google or Sam Adams, but may as well include those if you like - they may be the \"family owned\" businesses of the future.  For example, the Ortega family looks primed to become a dynasty after the wild success of Inditex.  Situations like RPM International, too, would be of interest, where the family doesn't own much of the company, but has been managed for generations (three in RPM's case) by the same family.   I'm especially interested in situations where high family ownership reduces the float, like Rollins Inc. or Wal-Mart.  FRP Holdings and the Baker family is another one.\n\nMaybe it's survivorship bias, but every time I run across a company like the ones above, with a high percentage of family ownership across generations, the companies always seem to be high quality compounders.  Unfortunately, \"family ownership\" isn't an easily screenable characteristic.  So, I'd love to find more companies like these - either with fantastic track records as possible investments, or with terrible track records to serve as a case study.\n\nSo, with that in mind  - what family owned, publicly traded companies are you all interested in?", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}, {"time": 1535468933.0, "submission_id": "9aysh0", "comment_id": "e4z7ty3", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 3, "submission_ratio": 0.3333333333333333, "submission_title": "Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc.
