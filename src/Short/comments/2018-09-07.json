So consumers are worse off straight up, as they have to buy this instead of the international good. It\u2019s true that some demand will move from international goods to domestic goods, *increasing* demand as you say, but don\u2019t forget the marginal rate of substitution. The increased price point will mean some people purchase a different product instead, which has a *decreasing* effect on demand.\n\nI think it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll see competitors join as these are industries being propped up by lobbying power.

Trump complains about RMB manipulation. If you decrease the demand for foreign exports (Chinese), you decrease the demand for the RMB. Downward pressure means the currency falls in value.
