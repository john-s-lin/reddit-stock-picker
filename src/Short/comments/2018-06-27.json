You get this strange sort of anticipation and traders trying to out play other traders, etc. It's specifically a time when no one believes it that it works best.\n\nThis can be said about the Active vs Passive investment debate. Passive investing works so well, because when everyone is trying to be active, then value is hard to find. When everyone is passive, then finding value is easy. Meaning when people believe most strongly in passive investing, then you should be actively searching for value.\n\nI'm very hesitant to comment on technical analysis here, because I usually end up arguing with a crowd of idiots, but the reality is that if you believe stocks represent ownership in companies, then you must also believe by logical extension that the price action of those companies also represents the underlying prospects for that business. There's a reason people say that, \"X is low for a reason\", because if no one is willing to pay for it, it's because the underlying business is junk.\n\nThe sad reality is that everyone uses TA. It's just most people don't want to believe it, or don't want to admit it. Don't fool yourself into thinking that revenue/profit projections are anything other than a clever application of TA. Buying a momentum business whether fundamentally, or technically is really the secret key that most successful people understand. Value investors are buying when downward momentum has exhausted itself and technical investors(if you're worth your weight) are buying when upward momentum is beginning.

It really needs to be private for the next few years in order to quietly make the changes they need as well as the capital they need too as they have a great product but their cash flow is bad and the stock price of HMNY is going to put a negative perception of the technology while they try to build it up.

They lost 2xs for every sale.  It is probably worth putting 500 dollars in for a speculative buy but it probably will go bust if they can't get enough cash to fund their operations.
