P/E ratio and the entire concept of value investing (Intelligent Investor) was for a different timeframe and a different investor but those underlying rules won't help you profit in the year of tech. If you are constantly only searching for small P/E, you'll lose out on other great opportunities that have a higher p/e ratio or are deemed \"expensive\". While many were just buying companies with low p/e that really didn't move much, there was tremendous profit to be made by \"buying high and selling higher.\"\n\n2. Never put a cent in Penny Stocks or Crapto or Ambition-killing plants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.   In stocks, always start small. Buy just a little bit at first. If it moves one way or another, you can either easily add more, hold or sell as needed. But when you start with too much of a first initial investment, you're in deep trouble should the stock go south and you'll drive yourself insane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.  Only invest what you're willing to lose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.  Invest in companies that you, your friends, your family and everyone you know could never do without.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6.   Don't invest in companies where its products and services are easily replicated by other companies or have been bested by other companies. ie. Snapchat, Fitbit, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7.  Use the \"Block\" feature on Stocktwits readily. Block anybody who constantly pumps up a stock or constantly bags down on a stock without sufficient data or evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8.  Think like the president and buy the stocks that conform to his ideology. Think in terms of how he thinks and you can profit tremendously.  If he's talking war rhetoric, buy DEFENSE.  If he hates China, short China, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Only invest in companies in which your belief in that company is to the point that win or lose, the company is always a great investment. So for me, I believe in Google. If Google should drop, I'm always buying more. And if it should rise, all the better. But to me, Google is at a level of quality like no other company and my faith in it is as such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10.  However, and this is related to #9, know that things change and that you should never be 'married' to a company or an idea if the fundamentals have changed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11. Don't ever ever ever ever bother with trading applications that give you free trading.  They will cost you much more when the site should inevitably crash. Just one second can mean thousands and thousands of dollars. The engineers who maintain the site (site reliability engineers) are generally more reliable in paid platforms as opposed to unpaid.  There's empirical evidence for this shown with a simple Google search. Free apps tend to crash more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12. Don't just be a day trader. Don't just be an investor. Don't just be a swing trader. Do all three consecutively. Create separate accounts to keep you in focus. But have one account where you are day-trading Stockaroo,  holding Stockaroo forever and swing-trading Stockaroo. So you benefit from three areas. As an example, Apple. I still have shares of Apple back from years ago. That's my long term investment. I never touch it.  But in a separate account, I also pulled off swing trades where I bought at 175 and sold at 215/share despite the fact I already had shares from prior. And I also daytrade Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n13. Don't get too carried away on the notion of holding stocks for one year to avoid taxes. Yes, it's ideal to hold a stock for as long as you can to avoid capital gains taxes on a shortterm deal but sometimes you have to take your losses as you could lose far more by keeping it there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n14.  If any stock moves violently upwards, Nvidia in 2017-2018, it'll crash and burn hard just as quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 10, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 29, "submission_ratio": 0.3448275862068966, "submission_title": "What unspoken rules do you believe to be true about price movement on stocks?", "submission_text": "One I've found is that popularity of the stock/company seems to matter.

Does anyone know why the P/B ratio is so much lower than other insurance companies?", "parent_score": 15, "parent_ratio": 0.06666666666666667}, {"time": 1546144886.0, "submission_id": "aasruf", "comment_id": "ecuoes9", "body": "There will not always be a time when a fluctuating stock will go above the purchase price", "score": 9, "num_replies": 0, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 2.25, "submission_title": "Buying stocks and cashing out early", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Buying stocks and cashing out early [deleted]", "parent_score": 4, "parent_ratio": 2.25}, {"time": 1546145282.0, "submission_id": "aasruf", "comment_id": "ecuovs6", "body": "there are strategies out there that allow you to earn from the stock market, so if you do a bit of research as to how to, you can learn to do it without having to guess.\n\ni'd recommend the book intelligent investor by benjamin graham and learn the principles that will guide you in this.", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 4, "submission_ratio": 0.25, "submission_title": "Buying stocks and cashing out early", "submission_text": "[deleted]", "parent_text": "Buying stocks and cashing out early [deleted]", "parent_score": 4, "parent_ratio": 0.25}, {"time": 1546212050.0, "submission_id": "aasruf", "comment_id": "ecwmtfe", "body": "You are referring to swing trading.
