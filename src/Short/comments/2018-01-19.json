In the case of stock options, the price comes from how the stock price moves and how much time is left on the contract. They can be used for many things other than \u201cspeculation\u201d or betting on stock movements. They can insure a current investment and \u201chedge\u201d or protect against risk, or falling prices.\n \nThere are two main types of options, \u201ccalls\u201d and \u201cputs.\u201d The best way to describe this is, options are a contract between the buyer and the seller (often referred to as the \u201cwriter\u201d). They specify a price (strike price), period (or length of the contract) and the option to call or put.\nA call contract allows the owner to call the writer (seller) and buy the shares for the price of the original contract (strike price). A put allows the contract holder to sell (put) said shares on the seller (writer) for the contract price (strike price).\n\nSay a crop farmer wanted to ensure that he could sell his harvest. He could enter into an agreement with the local vendor and offer them the option to buy a certain amount of crop at the end of the season for a determined amount. The farmer would \u201cwrite\u201d the contract for the specified amount and specified time. For instance 1 bushel (100 ears of corn, its actually 40-60, but just go with it, makes sense later) of the upcoming seasons harvest 2 months from now for $10. The farmer would ask that the vendor pays a small deposit, maybe $1.00 now to secure the contract. If the vendor like this and wants to buy 10 bushels in 2 months, he would give the farmer $10, for 10 contracts. At the end of the two months, the vendor could, but is not required to, buy 10 bushels of the crop at $10 a bushel.\nThe magic of this contract insures the price of the crop for both the farmer and the vendor, not to mention, it gives the farmer a little up front money before the harvest season.  Should the price of the crop raise over the next two months to $15 a bushel, the vendor is happy because he has the option to buy 10 bushels at $10 each. The farmer may be unhappy, because he could have sold his harvest for more. But if the price drops to say $5 a bushel, the farmer would benefit slightly because the vendor would probably not want to buy the crops at $10, so he would forgo the original contract, the farmer would keep the premium earned two months ago, and sell the corn to the vendor at the current price.\n \nThis is where even more market magic with options happens; say the price rose to $15 a bushel. The vendor owns 10 contracts to buy 10 bushels of corn and the vendor down the street who doesn\u2019t know the farmer and cannot find a good price on corns since it went up, asks vendor 1 for help. Vendor 1 can sell vendor 2 some or all of his contracts. He originally paid $1 per contract when the price was at $10 a bushel. Now that the price rose to $15 a bushel, vendor one asks vendor two for $25 for all 10 contracts with the farmer. Once he sells them, he makes a $15 profit and vendor 2 can now buy 10 bushels of corn from the farmer at $10 a bushel. Vendor one makes a $15 profit and never bought corn, vendor 2 can buy corn for well below the market price and sell it for a premium and the farmer sleeps well at night knowing he sold all of his corn before it was even harvested.\n \nOf course this is a little glamorous and highly optimistic. If the stock market worked out like that we would all be rich. This is just an easy introductory explanation into the world of options. Some keynotes, options are sold in packets, each consists of the option to buy 100 shares of a stock. There is a difference between US options and European options. In the US, options can be exercised at any time, you can buy the stock if you\u2019d like any time during the contract period. In Europe, the option can only be exercised at the end of the period.

And in the US it can easily double overnight.\n\nEV range is no longer 50 miles. We're at 200-300 miles, which is getting into a comfort zone for lots of people. This will keep improving.\n\nCharging stations are everywhere now, to the point where I'd feel comfortable taking a long road trip in an EV.\n\nMaintenance on EVs is dead-simple. There are very few moving parts and fluids. Parts are still expensive, but this will come down with scale.\n\nWe're seeing EVs with over 100,000 and the batteries are holding up reasonably well, maybe a 30% decrease in total capacity.

And in the US it can easily double overnight.\n\nEV range is no longer 50 miles. We're at 200-300 miles, which is getting into a comfort zone for lots of people. This will keep improving.\n\nCharging stations are everywhere now, to the point where I'd feel comfortable taking a long road trip in an EV.\n\nMaintenance on EVs is dead-simple. There are very few moving parts and fluids. Parts are still expensive, but this will come down with scale.\n\nWe're seeing EVs with over 100,000 and the batteries are holding up reasonably well, maybe a 30% decrease in total capacity.

Psh. So basically nothing substantive that I could seriously consider.\n\nMoving on. Here is an update to my portfolio, what stocks I held, what stocks I swing traded, what stocks I sold, what stocks I had mentioned in my previous post that were missed opportunities.\n\nTo start off: (not doing dd on them again, read previous post)\n\nMARK: Bought in around 9.75s, then bought more at at mid 11s then a very small portion at low 13s. Started selling off when it reached high 13's.\n\nMade roughly 30% gain on MARK. No longer own any of it. SUCCESS \n\nSQ: Switched this out with MJX because I thought itd be at least 1-2 months before it started going up again and wanted to make a quick buck off MJX. MJX started buying in at mid 31's and decided to sell off around 36, made roughly 20% profit when I could have made around the same with SQ if I kept it (bought SQ at 35s) NEUTRAL.\n\nMSFT: Got impatient, sold it off because I wanted to invest the money into more volatile growth stocks. Still a good pick though. NEUTRAL.\n\nKEM: Had someone saying this was a bad pick on the post because it was a commodity, bought in at low 15s, more at high 16s and then even more at high 16s. Will sell half before earnings, half will sell after. Up 20% so far. SUCCESS\n\nETP: My sell off point for this was if it hit 20 a share. Bought in high 17s sold off high 19s. 10% profit. Mediocre but still SUCCESS.\n\nMOMO: My favorite Chinese growth stock along with BITA. Someone said to ditch MOMO in the previous thread but I said no thank you. It's been giving slow gains but I'm very confident about it. Bought in at 25s, up 10% so far. SUCCESS.\n\nBITA: God I wish I had more money to have bought into this, this is another company I am very confident about. At one point I had bought in at 29s but kept swing trading when it hit 32s for quick buck. Bought in today at 37s again.\n\nTEUM: Really good company with a bright future, management is doing all they can to expand business and increase shareholder value. I originally had bought in at .71 and sold at 1.35s a few months back. I now bought in 275 at mid 2.30s. I believe this can reach around 6-8$ by end of year.\n\nOverall portfolio up 30% since New Years\n\nI did upgrade and now use 2k margin additionally\n\nPics: https://imgur.com/a/leIE6", "parent_text": "[deleted]", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}, {"time": 1516396864.0, "submission_id": "7rl96p", "comment_id": "dsxtm2m", "body": "Ya no.\n\nDisney is way bigger then Netflix and absolutely has the capability to step on their throat in the next decade if management takes the right steps.\n\nYou are overating Netflix original content.

You can't just look back on 5 years of historical data and extrapolate that trend out for the next 10 years. \n\nIn the past, they've had new foreign countries to expand into to juice their subscriber numbers. They won't have that going forward (unless they get into China). So they may hit saturation points in these foreign countries if the content doesn't appeal to their specific territorial tastes. \n\nI do agree that licensing and merchandising will be a huge source of revenue for the company. I've worked at several  studios and seen the $$$ generated by original IP. That's a largely untapped goldmine for them.\n\nTh subscriber numbers are probably what I disagree with you about the most. You're assuming a 6-fold increase in subscribers. That's a very optimistic. The only way they reach 650M subs is if they start limiting shared accounts or restrict viewing to 2 or 3 screens. If that happens, then 650M is probably attainable. But limiting the number of screens will be a tough pill to swallow for most customers.\n\nI've owned this rollercoaster of a stock for over 7 years.
