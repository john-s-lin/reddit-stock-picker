Investing in stocks is very risky and you could lose future opportunities if you don't know what you're doing.  \n\nIf you have a 401k, I assume you are meeting any match your employer offers.  That is the first thing you should do.  If you have that, the next thing you should do is open an IRA.  You can invest from the IRA into stocks but I do not recommend this starting out. You need to do a lot of research about basic passive investing before becoming active or especially investing in individual stocks.  \n\nThink of it as building a house.

It's never really too late to start in my opinion. I have a somewhat decent retirement set up already, so it just started as some kind of game to me. I guess I got competitive, so I started putting effort into understanding it more. Had some bad days for a while, but then got it down fairly well and used it for a new toy fund. Currently almost done with a little account challenge while trading options. $500 on June 1st, now at just over 8k. It's tons of fun.\n\nNow for the real talk. Learn your shit. Keep learning. Analyze every trade you make, see what you did wrong, and see what you did right. If you're not sure, ask. Find the trading style that suits you. Don't take a trade if you're not 100% confident. Manage your risk and don't get greedy. Eliminating financial pain in the beginning will help keep the emotion out of your trades. Plan when you're getting in and when you're getting out, and know why the price is moving in the direction it's going. If you're hesitant to take one, write down how many shares you could have bought at the price you wanted it for, make sure it hits that price on the ask, and see if the bid hits your target. Hit the charts and study to see why it was a good or bad trade. If there's a pattern to your mistakes, identify and correct it. Make sure you keep a trade journal too. \n\nDon't fuck with options until you understand trading stocks. You can lose money easier than you can make it. You're basically starting back on the basics when you decide you're ready for that. Lots more to learn there. As an example, I once lost about 5k in an hour on some Amazon calls because I didn't know what I was doing. I've also let similar amounts bleed to nothing because I didn't understand what theta was or how IV drops after an earnings report. You'll have similar experiences and you'll just have to think of it as a tuition cost if you can learn a lesson from it. \n\nEdit: at some point you'll know some companies very well. Keep an eye on them daily. 20 tickers that don't run similar patterns will always provide you with an opportunity regardless of what the market is doing.

It's never really too late to start in my opinion. I have a somewhat decent retirement set up already, so it just started as some kind of game to me. I guess I got competitive, so I started putting effort into understanding it more. Had some bad days for a while, but then got it down fairly well and used it for a new toy fund. Currently almost done with a little account challenge while trading options. $500 on June 1st, now at just over 8k. It's tons of fun.\n\nNow for the real talk. Learn your shit. Keep learning. Analyze every trade you make, see what you did wrong, and see what you did right. If you're not sure, ask. Find the trading style that suits you. Don't take a trade if you're not 100% confident. Manage your risk and don't get greedy. Eliminating financial pain in the beginning will help keep the emotion out of your trades. Plan when you're getting in and when you're getting out, and know why the price is moving in the direction it's going. If you're hesitant to take one, write down how many shares you could have bought at the price you wanted it for, make sure it hits that price on the ask, and see if the bid hits your target. Hit the charts and study to see why it was a good or bad trade. If there's a pattern to your mistakes, identify and correct it. Make sure you keep a trade journal too. \n\nDon't fuck with options until you understand trading stocks. You can lose money easier than you can make it. You're basically starting back on the basics when you decide you're ready for that. Lots more to learn there. As an example, I once lost about 5k in an hour on some Amazon calls because I didn't know what I was doing. I've also let similar amounts bleed to nothing because I didn't understand what theta was or how IV drops after an earnings report. You'll have similar experiences and you'll just have to think of it as a tuition cost if you can learn a lesson from it. \n\nEdit: at some point you'll know some companies very well. Keep an eye on them daily. 20 tickers that don't run similar patterns will always provide you with an opportunity regardless of what the market is doing.

If you're on an option that is under the break even price the execution price retreats to zero very quickly as you approach execution date.\n\nAgain it's all based on people wanting to buy or sell- would you buy an option close to expy knowing it has a long way to break even?

From what I can tell, P/E is a ratio of price/earnings, so it's usually a value such as x.y (e.g. 3.7), but when I went to look at the P/E history for Twitter here: [https://ycharts.com/companies/TWTR/pe\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/TWTR/pe_ratio) I see the value in the thousands:\n\n>Twitter PE Ratio (TTM):  \n**4513.00 for June 26, 2018**\n\nAm I looking at something else or what am I missing here?", "score": 1, "num_replies": 1, "is_root": 1, "submission_score": 2, "submission_ratio": 0.5, "submission_title": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion Tuesday - Jun 26, 2018", "submission_text": "These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday and Friday's will stay up till Monday.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news\n* StreetInsider news:\n * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing\n * [Corporate News](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News)\n * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n * [Economic data](https://www.streetinsider.com/Economic+Data)\n * [FED](https://www.streetinsider.com/Fed) - Federal Reserve news\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EPS,\" then google \"investopedia EPS\" and click the investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nPlease discuss your portfolios in the [Rate My Portfolio sticky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/sticky) or see past portfolio discussions with [this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?sort=new&q=Rate+My+Portfolio+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&t=all&restrict_sr=on)\n\nSee past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+daily+discussion&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n", "parent_text": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion Tuesday - Jun 26, 2018 These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday and Friday's will stay up till Monday.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amd) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news\n* StreetInsider news:\n * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing\n * [Corporate News](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News)\n * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n * [Economic data](https://www.streetinsider.com/Economic+Data)\n * [FED](https://www.streetinsider.com/Fed) - Federal Reserve news\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EPS,\" then google \"investopedia EPS\" and click the investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nPlease discuss your portfolios in the [Rate My Portfolio sticky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/sticky) or see past portfolio discussions with [this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?sort=new&q=Rate+My+Portfolio+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&t=all&restrict_sr=on)\n\nSee past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+daily+discussion&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n", "parent_score": 2, "parent_ratio": 0.5}, {"time": 1530039952.0, "submission_id": "8tz6v5", "comment_id": "e1c3ekn", "body": "Is anyone looking at $HMNY?

It's almost as if PE ratios don't stick well to tech stocks (a financial company with a PE of 270 would probably get murdered).

That said only recently have people gotten comfortable with a PE of higher than 20, as you can see in the chart I linked to. Here's my n00b explanation for PE, if you have a stock that is trading at 20 share and earns 1 dollar, it's got a PE of 20, that also means that it's return on your investment is about 5% per year. If that stock were trading at $10 and earning you $1, it's got a PE of 10, and is earning about 10% per year, making it a better investment. If it were 30, and earning 1, it has a PE of 30 and is earning about 3% per year. Obviously the best investment would be the lowest PE provided all things are equal. \n\nEach sector has their normal range, and you sort of learn that as you do research. \n\nBut stocks also have trends that can push the boundaries of rational decision making (outside of stocks bitcoin at the end of last year/beginning of this year is a great example of people getting caught up in irrational exuberance). \n\nThe best thing to do is to try to find a few companies that you like in a few different sectors, follow the direction of the sector, is it in favor, out of favor etc.. Follow the bigger picture too. Even if you pick a great stock with a ton of potential, if the rest of the market is taking a beating it's likely you will too. \n\nEdit: People have gotten more comfortable with higher PE ratios because traditional safer investments have lower yields so investors are chasing riskier assets to bridge that gap.

If it were 30, and earning 1, it has a PE of 30 and is earning about 3% per year. Obviously the best investment would be the lowest PE provided all things are equal. \n\nEach sector has their normal range, and you sort of learn that as you do research. \n\nBut stocks also have trends that can push the boundaries of rational decision making (outside of stocks bitcoin at the end of last year/beginning of this year is a great example of people getting caught up in irrational exuberance). \n\nThe best thing to do is to try to find a few companies that you like in a few different sectors, follow the direction of the sector, is it in favor, out of favor etc.. Follow the bigger picture too. Even if you pick a great stock with a ton of potential, if the rest of the market is taking a beating it's likely you will too. \n\nEdit: People have gotten more comfortable with higher PE ratios because traditional safer investments have lower yields so investors are chasing riskier assets to bridge that gap.

Realistically you are closer to retirement than most on this board, and even if you will always have access to a job (which may or may not be true as the market 20 years from today could change drastically), there are still different qualities of life that you are risking by putting half of your savings into risky stocks. Admittedly, I don't know much about mining stocks so maybe it is a great play; regardless, this is more a cost benefit analysis of upside-downside as it pertains to your life. Now, I am not saying DONT do it. Instead, what I am saying is that if you are going to do this, then I would put a smaller amount of the portfolio into mining stocks than you are currently planning depending on your risk appetite. It seems that your appetite for risk is pretty large based on a past situation that really isnt applicable here...how many smart people have been right about one thing and completely wrong about another? In sum, don't bet the farm, the downside at this point in time is too great. Also, who is to say there won't be a massive economic downturn in two years and your wife can't work and your income is depressed? You don't want to take unnecessarily large risks at this point in the game, especially with the relative comfort you are already at. \n\nI would probably do half to 65% of your aforementioned planned investments into mining stocks if you believe in their value. The rest just put in a safer play and keep the remaining money on the sidelines during the next downturn if that is your preferred plan. Now, if you could truly blink and lose 50k and genuinely not have your retirement plan significantly altered or dependent on your wife working and yourself always being employed (because you have--preferably mid--six figure 401k + IRA, or property investments, inheritance etc.), then throw this advice out the window and do as you please.\n\nEdit: Also consider how losing significant amounts of money could potentially impact your relationship with your wife.

Realistically you are closer to retirement than most on this board, and even if you will always have access to a job (which may or may not be true as the market 20 years from today could change drastically), there are still different qualities of life that you are risking by putting half of your savings into risky stocks. Admittedly, I don't know much about mining stocks so maybe it is a great play; regardless, this is more a cost benefit analysis of upside-downside as it pertains to your life. Now, I am not saying DONT do it. Instead, what I am saying is that if you are going to do this, then I would put a smaller amount of the portfolio into mining stocks than you are currently planning depending on your risk appetite. It seems that your appetite for risk is pretty large based on a past situation that really isnt applicable here...how many smart people have been right about one thing and completely wrong about another? In sum, don't bet the farm, the downside at this point in time is too great. Also, who is to say there won't be a massive economic downturn in two years and your wife can't work and your income is depressed? You don't want to take unnecessarily large risks at this point in the game, especially with the relative comfort you are already at. \n\nI would probably do half to 65% of your aforementioned planned investments into mining stocks if you believe in their value. The rest just put in a safer play and keep the remaining money on the sidelines during the next downturn if that is your preferred plan. Now, if you could truly blink and lose 50k and genuinely not have your retirement plan significantly altered or dependent on your wife working and yourself always being employed (because you have--preferably mid--six figure 401k + IRA, or property investments, inheritance etc.), then throw this advice out the window and do as you please.\n\nEdit: Also consider how losing significant amounts of money could potentially impact your relationship with your wife.

Sure, it can suck to lose it all but the risk of losing it might be losing half of it. I think the only biggest risk is if alchemy was discovered tomorrow but then again, the whole world would be turned upside down by it lol.\n\nMy issue is that I don't feel like I've done some serious research. I'm mainly going by \"markets go up and down every few years\", \"recessions happen every few years\", and the historical statistics I've seen from the mining companies. They are all in tune with going up and down based on certain economical or political events that repeat themselves over and over every few years. I can put the money away and not think about it. That's my thinking. I can live with the remaining 25k for several years as a big ass buffer because my expenses are incredibly low and we live a very frugal lifestyle.
