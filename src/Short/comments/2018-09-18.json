The first is by paying a dividend. A dividend is a payout that is usually a percentage of the share price. It can be paid out monthly, quarterly, or yearly but most companies pay it out quarterly. Let\u2019s say the company pays out a 4% dividend that is paid out quarterly and the share price of that company is $100. You will get a $1 dividend for the quarter (4% dividend by 4 quarters). This will happen every quarter as long as the company pays out the dividend and the amount of the dividend can vary based on share price (for example company share price is now $200 so you get a $2 dividend payout for the quarter).\n\nThe second way a stock provides returns is through share appreciation. This is when the price of a share for the company goes up. For example you buy a company at $50 and it\u2019s now listed at $100. You won\u2019t see a penny of this appreciation until you actually sell any shares and share price can obviously go up, down, or stagnate.\n\nWith dividends, you can reinvest them back into company shares. For example, that 4% dividend company pays out a 1% dividend for the quarter. Instead of cashing out that 1% dividend, you can reinvest it to buy roughly 1% of a share of said company. Note that in the US, unless you\u2019re holding it in a tax advantaged account, you will pay taxes on the dividends regardless of whether you cash out or reinvest it.\n\nWith share appreciation, remember you don\u2019t see a penny until you sell any shares. If you sell shares, you could use the money to buy back more shares of the company but that normally wouldn\u2019t make much sense since you\u2019ll be taxed for selling, possibly have to pay selling/buying fees, and potentially have to buy back in at a higher price. That\u2019s why people buy and hold for a long time. They can defer taxes and cash out when they want/need to. Thus, you\u2019re better off just letting the shares sit there unless you need the money or aren\u2019t as confident in the company going forward and want to take your profits. Down the line you can sell when you need the money on your own terms.
