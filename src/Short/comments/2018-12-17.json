S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to a slightly lower open.\n*****\n> Recent economic data have reignited worries of economic slowdown around the globe and kept a lid on stock returns. The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 \u2014 its lowest closing level since April \u2014 after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.\n*****\n> The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing\u2019s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump. The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other.\n*****\n> Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to a slightly lower open.\n*****\n> Recent economic data have reignited worries of economic slowdown around the globe and kept a lid on stock returns. The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 \u2014 its lowest closing level since April \u2014 after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.\n*****\n> The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing\u2019s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump. The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other.\n*****\n> Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES NOW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/QQ5BxGh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fJLnif.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oXBvAdb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3NMlNe4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/710aQ4q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $FDX $NKE $BB $ORCL $RHT $GIS $DRI $RAD $PAYX $NCS $FDS $NAV $WOR $ACN $HEI $CSBR $WBA $KMX $SCS $LOVE $CAG $JBL$WGO $CCL $APOG $MLHR $NEOG $CTAS $PIR $SAFM $ABM $AIR $CAMP $ATU $REVG $SCHL $LAKE $TWST)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/th9s5Mb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDAWfON.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/cnl5M5b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/sngborn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2AUf62e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/00kDWeD.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3hRrGBx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING DISCUSSIONS:\n\n* JNJ\n* JACK\n* GS\n* CRBP\n* MDRX\n* REZI\n* SPAR\n* EMR\n* WCG\n* STOR\n* SMG\n* CPK\n* ERJ\n* CUE\n* XLF\n* FDX\n* ADS\n* G\n* CSL\n* DORM\n* SPX\n* GOOS\n* ATNX\n* NBEV\n* BKS\n* LOOP\n* SCG\n* ENDP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ba-googl-amzn-gspcg--more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Boeing, Embraer** \u2013 The jet makers announced they had finalized the terms of a joint venture first announced in July, in which Boeing will pay $4.2 billion for an 80 percent stake.

The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 \u2014 its lowest closing level since April \u2014 after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.\n*****\n> The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing\u2019s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump. The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other.\n*****\n> Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES NOW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/QQ5BxGh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fJLnif.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oXBvAdb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3NMlNe4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/710aQ4q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $FDX $NKE $BB $ORCL $RHT $GIS $DRI $RAD $PAYX $NCS $FDS $NAV $WOR $ACN $HEI $CSBR $WBA $KMX $SCS $LOVE $CAG $JBL$WGO $CCL $APOG $MLHR $NEOG $CTAS $PIR $SAFM $ABM $AIR $CAMP $ATU $REVG $SCHL $LAKE $TWST)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/th9s5Mb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDAWfON.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/cnl5M5b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/sngborn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2AUf62e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/00kDWeD.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3hRrGBx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING DISCUSSIONS:\n\n* JNJ\n* JACK\n* GS\n* CRBP\n* MDRX\n* REZI\n* SPAR\n* EMR\n* WCG\n* STOR\n* SMG\n* CPK\n* ERJ\n* CUE\n* XLF\n* FDX\n* ADS\n* G\n* CSL\n* DORM\n* SPX\n* GOOS\n* ATNX\n* NBEV\n* BKS\n* LOOP\n* SCG\n* ENDP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ba-googl-amzn-gspcg--more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Boeing, Embraer** \u2013 The jet makers announced they had finalized the terms of a joint venture first announced in July, in which Boeing will pay $4.2 billion for an 80 percent stake.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to a slightly lower open.\n*****\n> Recent economic data have reignited worries of economic slowdown around the globe and kept a lid on stock returns. The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 \u2014 its lowest closing level since April \u2014 after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.\n*****\n> The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing\u2019s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump. The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other.\n*****\n> Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES NOW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/QQ5BxGh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fJLnif.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oXBvAdb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3NMlNe4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/710aQ4q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $FDX $NKE $BB $ORCL $RHT $GIS $DRI $RAD $PAYX $NCS $FDS $NAV $WOR $ACN $HEI $CSBR $WBA $KMX $SCS $LOVE $CAG $JBL$WGO $CCL $APOG $MLHR $NEOG $CTAS $PIR $SAFM $ABM $AIR $CAMP $ATU $REVG $SCHL $LAKE $TWST)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/th9s5Mb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDAWfON.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/cnl5M5b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/sngborn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2AUf62e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/00kDWeD.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3hRrGBx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING DISCUSSIONS:\n\n* JNJ\n* JACK\n* GS\n* CRBP\n* MDRX\n* REZI\n* SPAR\n* EMR\n* WCG\n* STOR\n* SMG\n* CPK\n* ERJ\n* CUE\n* XLF\n* FDX\n* ADS\n* G\n* CSL\n* DORM\n* SPX\n* GOOS\n* ATNX\n* NBEV\n* BKS\n* LOOP\n* SCG\n* ENDP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ba-googl-amzn-gspcg--more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Boeing, Embraer** \u2013 The jet makers announced they had finalized the terms of a joint venture first announced in July, in which Boeing will pay $4.2 billion for an 80 percent stake.

The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 \u2014 its lowest closing level since April \u2014 after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.\n*****\n> The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing\u2019s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump. The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other.\n*****\n> Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES NOW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/QQ5BxGh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fJLnif.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oXBvAdb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3NMlNe4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/710aQ4q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $FDX $NKE $BB $ORCL $RHT $GIS $DRI $RAD $PAYX $NCS $FDS $NAV $WOR $ACN $HEI $CSBR $WBA $KMX $SCS $LOVE $CAG $JBL$WGO $CCL $APOG $MLHR $NEOG $CTAS $PIR $SAFM $ABM $AIR $CAMP $ATU $REVG $SCHL $LAKE $TWST)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/th9s5Mb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDAWfON.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/cnl5M5b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/sngborn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2AUf62e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/00kDWeD.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3hRrGBx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING DISCUSSIONS:\n\n* JNJ\n* JACK\n* GS\n* CRBP\n* MDRX\n* REZI\n* SPAR\n* EMR\n* WCG\n* STOR\n* SMG\n* CPK\n* ERJ\n* CUE\n* XLF\n* FDX\n* ADS\n* G\n* CSL\n* DORM\n* SPX\n* GOOS\n* ATNX\n* NBEV\n* BKS\n* LOOP\n* SCG\n* ENDP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ba-googl-amzn-gspcg--more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Boeing, Embraer** \u2013 The jet makers announced they had finalized the terms of a joint venture first announced in July, in which Boeing will pay $4.2 billion for an 80 percent stake.

The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world\u2019s two largest economies against each other.\n*****\n> Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking arm. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES NOW:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](http://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/QQ5BxGh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET HEAT MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fJLnif.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oXBvAdb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3NMlNe4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/710aQ4q.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($MU $FDX $NKE $BB $ORCL $RHT $GIS $DRI $RAD $PAYX $NCS $FDS $NAV $WOR $ACN $HEI $CSBR $WBA $KMX $SCS $LOVE $CAG $JBL$WGO $CCL $APOG $MLHR $NEOG $CTAS $PIR $SAFM $ABM $AIR $CAMP $ATU $REVG $SCHL $LAKE $TWST)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/th9s5Mb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#THIS AFTERNOON'S POST-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nT.B.A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDAWfON.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/cnl5M5b.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/sngborn.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/2AUf62e.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/00kDWeD.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/3hRrGBx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING DISCUSSIONS:\n\n* JNJ\n* JACK\n* GS\n* CRBP\n* MDRX\n* REZI\n* SPAR\n* EMR\n* WCG\n* STOR\n* SMG\n* CPK\n* ERJ\n* CUE\n* XLF\n* FDX\n* ADS\n* G\n* CSL\n* DORM\n* SPX\n* GOOS\n* ATNX\n* NBEV\n* BKS\n* LOOP\n* SCG\n* ENDP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-ba-googl-amzn-gspcg--more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Boeing, Embraer** \u2013 The jet makers announced they had finalized the terms of a joint venture first announced in July, in which Boeing will pay $4.2 billion for an 80 percent stake.
