I have no prior experience with trading, nor do my family or friends. I'll be posting intermittently over the next several months regarding my learning process, why I do what I do, and making an earnest attempt at better understanding this part of the economy. The goal isn't to make money, which is why I'm not just dumping money into an index fund (also ethical reasons). Hopefully others are able to take my experiences and use them to their advantage.\n\n   \n \n\n**\\[Basic Stats\\]**\n\nTo start off with, I'm 30 years old. I work as a software engineer, and am currently working on two bachelor degrees (Computer Science and Political Science) to add to my three associate degrees.\n\nI use Fidelity to trade with. My trading style would probably best be likened to a long-term trader. I don't do enough research or due diligence to call myself an investor, such as reading every quarterly report and juxtaposing it against future outlooks. At most, I read news articles and spend \\~1 hour looking at the company's information through Fidelity's research tabs before determining if I'll buy a particular stock or not.\n\nAll of the money that I put forward are funds that I couldn't care less about losing. \n\n   \n \n\n**\\[My First Trades\\]**\n\nIn September, I read an article that outlined several companies that were doing well in the renewable energy sector ([https://www.investopedia.com/investing/alternative-energy-stocks/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/alternative-energy-stocks/)). I decided later that month to take the dive. \n\n   \n \n\n# 9/24/18\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AY|Atlantica Yield|20|$20.47|$414.35|\n|CVA|Covanta Holding Corporation|20|$17.00|$344.95|\n|PEGI|Pattern Energy Group, Inc|11|$20.62|$231.77|\n\nI bought these companies because I have no idea what I'm doing and had to start somewhere. I took the news article's author at their word and opened an account with Fidelity. I'm a big ol' libby-lib lib, so renewable energy was pretty much a given. I look for businesses that primarily have decent social and environmental policies.\n\n   \n \n\n# 9/25/18\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PEGI|Pattern Energy Group, Inc|9|$20.33|$187.92|\n\nThis was my first experience with loss in the stock market, the very next day lol. It wasn't much, but it was interesting to see the prices fluctuate throughout the day and finally land on a number. I spent some time learning about market orders and limit orders. All purchases so far were market orders, which didn't necessarily work in my favor. Paying the asking price on PEGI gave me a few extra pennies per share in loss. But I bought in a better price than I did the other 11 shares, bringing me up a 20 share total and bringing the average price paid down to $20.49.\n\n   \n \n\n# 9/26/18\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CDZI|Cadiz, Inc|10|$10.91|$114.06|\n\nDecided to \"diversify\" and get into another industry that I think will be exploding over the next few decades: water rights, logistics, and purification. In California, where Cadiz is located, I think this will become incredibly relevant with the recent increase in wildfires and their intensity.\n\nUsing Fidelity, I'm seeing a lot of \"upgrades\" and \"downgrades\" in the news columns for a lot of various stocks.

I was looking at SNAP as a potential short, but now I\u2019m considering a long investment, and here\u2019s why:\n\n1) When you look at the actual data, it\u2019s ridiculously sticky. The average user of its Android app spends 50 minutes a day on it, and this is a figure that is growing. Source: https://www.recode.net/2018/6/25/17501224/instagram-facebook-snapchat-time-spent-growth-data\n\nAnd that\u2019s the shitty version of its app \u2014 the iphone app data is not available, but I'll be conservative and assume it's also 50 minutes a day. \n\nEyeballs using the app, watching what is essentially the TV for Generation Y (since they don\u2019t watch actual TV as much as we millenials and Gen Xers and baby boomers did) = big $$$ over time.\n\n2) The balance sheet. Contrary to certain posts I\u2019ve seen here, it actually has a very pristine balance sheet with NO DEBT. Yes, really. The balance sheet is here:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000156459018025190/snap-10q_20180930.htm#CONSOLIDATED_BALANCE_SHEETS\n\nThere is over $1.4 billion in cash and no debt. This is the kind of balance sheet that almost any company would dream of.\n\nSince there are 1.28 million diluted shares of stock, it means $1.09 a share just in cash\u2026 which, at $6.49 a share, is almost 17% of the market cap!\n\n3) Demographics. It has 84 million users in the 18-24 year old age group, looking at the app for almost an hour a day. This is a very difficult demographic group to crack, and it\u2019s extremely difficult to grab them in such huge numbers and for such a huge amount of time each day.\n\n4) Profitability is getting closer every quarter. Revenue is growing by almost 50% a year, cost of revenue is declining (both as a percentage and on an absolute basis), and the fixed G&amp;A costs are basically flat year over year. The R&amp;D and sales &amp; marketing expenses are really investments in future revenue growth, so I don\u2019t worry about them. You don\u2019t have to be a math whiz to see what the income statement looks like in 5 years.\n\n5) The stock price is way, way down. As Andrew Left put it on CNBC, it\u2019s not got much further down it can possibly go.\n\nAll right, so please change my mind before I blow a bunch of money buying some shares.

It\u2019s also the one that is completely out of your hands.\n\nFrom 1926 to today, there are 993 rolling ten-year periods. A person just starting to invest could have seen a market that gained as much as 596% or lost as much as 37%.\n\nThe Great Depression left scars on an entire generation. Between 1930 and 1951, only eight people were hired to work on the NYSE trading floor. If we were to experience another catastrophe like this today, the Dow would be below 3,000 in September 2021. If I saw stocks fall 90%, I don\u2019t think what happened next would influence me at all. The Dow could rise to 50,000 by 2030 and I would kick and scream the whole way up, with a tin foil hat on for good measure.\n\nPeople in the 1960s were certainly aware of what their parent\u2019s experienced in The Great Depression, but it wasn\u2019t their experience. They knew about the crash, but they couldn\u2019t remember it.\n\nThink about people who came into their prime earning and investing years in the late 1970s. They remember the oil embargo. They remember waiting in line for gas. They remember high interest rates, and they certainly remember high inflation.\n\nIn 14 out of 36 months from 1978-1980, CPI came in over 1%. In the 452 months since, that\u2019s happened just 6 times. $1 after inflation shrank to $0.72 in just 36 months.

I wasn't aware that this had actually happened for awhile after, because it was automatically reinvested. I found the settings, and chose to route it directly into my core account. The account it was being reinvested into was SPAXX, which I'm not against, but I'd rather take that at different time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2018.10.2\n\n| **Symbol** |**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CNSL|Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc|10|$13.20|$136.90|\n|FSLR|First Solar, Inc|5|$49.14|$250.65|\n|FKWL|Franklin Wireless Corporation|50|$1.98|$103.70|\n|FCEL|FuelCell Energy, Inc|100|$1.09|$113.95|\n|JSDA|Jones Soda Company|100|$0.41|$45.95|\n\nTook another stab at stocks, used Fidelity's stock catalog to search through various criteria like dividends, sector, and market cap. Settled on these five.\n\n* CNSL: Diversified telecommunications. A company that's been around for several decades and pays a high dividend. Their last three quarters have been unprofitable, but I think they'll turn it around.\n* FSLR: Another renewable energy stock. This one has been around for awhile, and took a massive hit in June dropping from $70 to $55.  They massively beat Q1 earnings, missed Q2 by a roughly mirrored amount, and swung back profitable in Q3. I think they'll rise back up, which is why I bought them. \n* FKWL: Franklin Wireless deal primarily in networking solutions. I bought this stock because I'm keen on their uses, and buying stock will keep me far more interested than simply reading about it every now and again. There's a chance they'll create a product that could become ubiquitous. They recently signed a deal with Qualcomm, so they're able to work with big-name corporations. \n* FCEL: Fuel cell energy was something that was being talked about when I was in high school. It was supposed to be the next huge breakthrough, bypassing electric vehicles. Turns out, this technology never really took off. Was surprised to see it still being traded, even more so to see that they still had projects and were working on new innovations. Decided to buy 100 shares and see what happens. Quarterly profits appear routinely unprofitable, suspect this company might fold.\n* JSDA: Jones Soda is a local favorite. I bought shares in them because I enjoy the product. These are also the cheapest shares of a business I know of, so that was interesting. I doubt they'll ever replace Pepsi or Coke, but their beverages are awesome. This one is a mixed bag for me that will likely require more research into their financials to see if this is going to be something I want long-term. There's extremely little information on Fidelity's website due to the small cap of the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2018.10.3\n\n| **Symbol** |**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|JSDA|Jones Soda Company|100|$0.48|$52.72|\n\nWanted more of Jones Soda's stock. I find the correlation between how cheap the shares are the rate at which I gain or lose funds to be interesting. Similar to the penny stock effect on a less volatile scale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2018.10.5\n\nCovanta pays a $5.00 dividend. Deposited into core account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2018.10.18\n\n| **Symbol** |**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|JSDA|Jones Soda Company|150|$0.35|$57.45|\n\nI bought more shares at a lower price in an attempt at what I believe is \"dollar cost averaging\" on a micro scale. I noticed that the $5 dividend from Covanta was in the account, so I used that in conjunction with my other funds. It was satisfying to already see how the dividends system works and use it for other things. \n\nI don't think this has personally changed my outlook any, although I understand why some people continue to do it. If X &gt; Y and you bought shares at X price, and the shares are now at Y price, it follows that you'd want to buy more at the Y price so long as you have available capital. \n\nTo me, that's a gambling trap. Setting a hard limit prevents a downward spiral. This must be where the stop loss orders and other trading options I haven't used yet come in.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 295100, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Stock Adventure #2", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xzu9k/my_stock_adventure_2/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "Get_Merped_brochacho", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ofdra0p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542499045, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9y1c6e/weed_stocks/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9y1c6e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9y1c6e/weed_stocks/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542499047, "score": 1, "selftext": "Are there any weed stocks that are predicted to boom soon that I should know about?

But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks closed with gains in the S&amp;P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&amp;P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.\n*****\n&gt; \"Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,\" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.\n*****\n&gt; \"We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,\" said Emanuel. \"The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n*****\n&gt; Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n*****\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n*****\n&gt; \"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n*****\n&gt; Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n*****\n&gt; Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n*****\n&gt; \"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports \u2014 primarily in agriculture and aircraft \u2014 and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,\" they wrote.\n*****\n&gt; *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iaf0NzN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cbuqBSO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/u5gI6iH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rbQVQqe.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SzYiqA3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mdFuI9S.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5tQvUoo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lKyFFgp.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/spvb4Xb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTyGhJe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HIe3JGx.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Thanksgiving Market Returns\n\n&gt; Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren\u2019t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&amp;P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index\u2019s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&amp;P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-During-Thanks.png))**\n\n&gt; As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year\u2019s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&amp;P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Post-Thanks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Let\u2019s Talk Volatility\n\n&gt; After the least volatile third quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.\n\n\n&gt; \u201cLast year we saw the S&amp;P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times\u2014one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we\u2019ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don\u2019t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes\u2014 which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we\u2019ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/surprisingly-the-s-and-p-500-index-is-in-a-very-tight-range-this-year.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator\n\n&gt; On a closing basis, the S&amp;P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&amp;P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&amp;P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&amp;P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**\n\n&gt; First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&amp;P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&amp;P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.\n\n&gt; Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&amp;P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&amp;P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n&gt; Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for November 19th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.18.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$TGT** \n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$LOW** \n&gt; * **$KSS** \n&gt; * **$TJX** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$LB** \n&gt; * **$GWGH** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$URBN** \n&gt; * **$ROST** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$SPB** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$CPB** \n&gt; * **$PSTG** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$A** \n&gt; * **$ADI** \n&gt; * **$LEJU** \n&gt; * **$JEC** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$JACK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$FL** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$GHG \n&gt; * **$BJ** \n&gt; * **$BECN** \n&gt; * **$QD** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$DY** \n&gt; * **$BRKS** \n&gt; * **$NUAN** \n&gt; * **$VBLT** \n&gt; * **$SSI** \n&gt; * **$NM** \n&gt; * **$SFL** \n&gt; * **$NJR** \n&gt; * **$MMS** \n&gt; * **$KLIC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/C1Wbt7x.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/RLrxfhS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sL6q1U1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.19.18 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dLZ9tAg.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.19.18 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GFZEbnt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ge36dMI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.20.18 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KvQCqkM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TWwZpJH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.21.18 After Market Close:*** \nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.22.18 Before Market Open:*** \nNONE.
