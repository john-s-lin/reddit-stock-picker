Up\n2. Down\n3. Sideways\n\nWith the swing high/low definition now in mind we can start to build some layers on to the chart to identify these market phases and start to do a simple count of these swing highs and lows. In short\n\n1. The market is going up when price is making higher highs and higher lows\n2. The market is going down when price is making lower highs and lower lows\n3. The market is going sideways when price is not making higher highs and higher lows\u00a0***OR***\u00a0lower highs lower lows\n\nThis may sound like child\u2019s play and a statement of the obvious but you will be surprised at how often\u00a0people will\u00a0forget these simple\u00a0***facts***. One of the biggest questions I get asked is, which way is it a market going? By doing a simple exercise you can see which way that price is going and decide on your trading plan and more importantly\u00a0***timing of a trade***. What do I mean by timing? It may be that you are looking for a shorting opportunity as the overall trend is down but price on your entry time frame is still going up (making HH\u2019s &amp; HL\u2019s).\u00a0 There is, at this stage, no point in trying to short a rising market until price action start to point down (making LH\u2019s &amp; LL\u2019s.

Given that this stock has lost money from my initial trade, the dividend was a soothing relief. Not nearly enough to cover the total loss, but enough to assuage any jitters. With 2018.11.16's positions, this dividend brings my total unrealized loss to \\~$7 for PEGI. Unless the \"Total Gain/Loss\" in Fidelity tracks dividends as well when calculating that bit, although I'm under the impression that it only accounts for market movement.\n\n \n\n# 2018.11.1\n\nReceived a dividend from CNSL for $3.87. Not as much as PEGI, but that's to be expected considering the amount of shares I've bought compared to PEGI as well as their respective dividend percentages. I didn't spend the dividend from PEGI, so this gave me about \\~$12 in my core account to mess around with.\n\n \n\n# 2018.11.9\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|UEPS|Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc|50|$4.73|$241.45|\n\nI've seen a lot of references to \"catching a falling knife\" in an analogous way to describe stocks that aren't experiencing a \"dip\" so much as a serious correction or even bankruptcy/free fall. When I looked at this stock, I felt as though this corporation might be an example of that. As I did a bit of research, I came to the conclusion that their business would likely come up again rather than stay at low levels. So I bought in.\n\nIn Q3, there were no reports. In Q4, they beat estimates by $0.01, for $0.28/share. It's a foreign company, based in South Africa. South Africa is currently going through a ton of societal, governmental, and existential issues, so this is a company that I didn't want to get involved with long term. I intend to sell this stock between 11.19 and 11.21, but we'll see how it does. The company provides internet access and job boards to people, so this seems like a business that could thrive better than most in the area.\n\nTheir stock has a 52-week high of $13.20. In September, they took a massive hit, dropping from \\~$9.50 to \\~$6.50.  It happened again shortly before I bought the shares, dropping from \\~$7.00 in early November to \\~4.50.\n\n \n\n# 2018.11.14\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ENPH|Enphase Energy, Inc|23|$5.43|$129.84|\n\nEnphase Energy is a company that I think will eventually provide a decent market cap, then a dividend. \n\n* Q1 of 2018 was unprofitable, but they beat estimates by $0.02 for -$0.01/share. \n* Q2 had a similar experience; beat estimates by $0.01 for $0.02/share.\n* Q3 is incremental, met estimates for $0.04/share.\n\nThey're borrowing money, but that's to be expected for expansion. Seem to have new partnerships and contracts consistently. Long term, this will be a great buy I think and will add to it a few more times.\n\n \n\n# 2018.11.15\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company Name**|**Shares**|**Share Price**|**Total**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CWEN|Clearway Energy, Inc|20|$16.82|$341.27|\n|HMMR|Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corporation|300|$0.34|$107.85|\n\nClearway Energy is one that I've had on my watch list for several weeks, and noticed that it's gone down by a drastic amount for it's history. I did a bit of research, and the only thing I could come up with was that their projects in California were subject to some of the wildfires and investors decided to sell before losses were tallied. They have some natural gas plants which I'm against, but their other sites outweigh that portion.\n\nI perceived it as a dip, and bought it. In the morning, I'll sell UEPS if it's profitable and buy more CWEN.\n\nHammer Fiber Optics is one that I was iffy on. It's a penny stock, which typically aren't what I'm looking for. But their business is intriguing. Fiber optics is a much more powerful tool for communication throughput than copper or other mediums. They're seemingly at the tail end of their stock price, diving from highs of $40 in 2017 to under $0.35 today. This is nothing short of a bet, although intuition is saying it'll pay off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n# 2018.11.16\n\nSadly both CWEN went up in price and UEPS went down from profitable, so I didn't purchase more of CWEN. Almost wish I did yesterday, but markets were already closed. \n\nOn the bright side, today is the first day I've felt as though I've \"beaten\" the market with this experiment. Managed to come up about $50 for \\~1.6% gain in my portfolio while DJIA is +0.49%, NASDAQ is -0.15%, and S&amp;P 500 is +0.22%. That's after a few losses, mind you.\n\nI've got a heavy concentration in renewable energy which I like, but isn't good for diversification. It's one of the reasons my stocks have been less profitable than market average, renewables haven't done spectacularly since I've bought them. That's short term stuff though, so it's not an issue to me. In order to counter this, future purchases will likely reside somewhere in the mining sector for lithium and related metals. It'll provide a synergistic approach to my portfolio. My concern is finding a mining company that isn't completely and utterly terrible for the environment, which mining is by its nature. \n\nI'm also looking at Sony ($SNE) as a buy, but would have to sell other shares to do so. May buy 4-5 shares with the UEPS sale.\n\nOther buys I'm looking at:\n\n* $GE @ \\~$5: If they manage their debt well after their asset sales and come strong with renewable innovation, in my opinion GE could rise well over what their market cap was at their height. But that's a big if. Waiting for their quarterly reports after these asset sales show up to decide if I buy in.\n* $FB @ $110: I don't agree with Facebook's privacy or their other creepy shit (lookin' at you, nude selfie database), but there's little denying that they're going to be around for awhile. Maybe not as a social media company, but definitely as a company. Betting heavily on AI, virtual reality, and quantum computing.\n* $TSLA @ $250: I mean, you could say \"no shit\", but personally my opinion is that TSLA is too overvalued for the economy. When an economic crash comes, that's when I'm going to buy into Tesla, and I'm going to buy in hard. Watching their battery developments closely.\n* $NVDA @ $100: This is just a byproduct of a vicious cycle. Personally think investors will keep being spooked and it'll devastate the share price to \\~$80 by January. Prediction: it'll snap back to $170 by Fall of 2019 and hover there until new innovations come out. Not ballsy (or knowledgeable) enough for options at this point in my stock adventure, but will be interesting to watch and see if I'm right.\n* $PBI @ under $9: Pitney Bowes, Inc is a company on my watch list that I think is going to spike. Great dividend, and don't have a wildly fluctuating earnings report for each quarter. Will eventually buy this with some funds assuming they're still under $9 when said funds are available.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 295265, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Stock Adventure #3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9yakuz/my_stock_adventure_3/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "int8blog", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ovdvt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542543635, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9y5kae/looking_for_social_media_stock_prices_forecasters/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9y5kae", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9y5kae/looking_for_social_media_stock_prices_forecasters/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542543636, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi there, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been looking into certain statistical tools for combining expert advice and I am about to start a hobby project trying to predict stock movement.
