response is. \"Who? What club? The Eredivisie? Let's not waste my time here.\" \n\n\nBut it won't be long before you'll hear more about FC Utrecht's coach, [**Erik Ten Hag**](https://dynamic.decorrespondent.nl/media/1920/57407533825fc5433181599.jpg) (47). I will explain to you why he's the brightest prospect in the Dutch coaching world, and why you'll most definitely hear more about him. Whether that'll be in the Bundesliga, the Premier League or somewhere else I do not know, but FC Utrecht is definitely not his limit.\n\n\n**Teams managed**\n\n\n2006\u20132009\tFC Twente (assistant)\n\n2009\u20132012\tPSV Eindhoven (assistant)\n\n2012\u20132013\tGo Ahead Eagles\n\n2013\u20132015\tBayern Munich II\n\n2015\u2013?????\tFC Utrecht\n\n\n\n\n\n**Learning from the best**\n\nNot many in the Netherlands had heard of Erik ten Hag when he managed to successfully fight for promotion with Dutch second division side Go Ahead Eagles, but journalists were impressed with this achievement nonetheless. \n\nThey were surprised however, when Ten Hag chose to go abroad to join Bayern Munich's reserve side as their new manager. As were many in the Bavarian capital. Who the hell is Erik ten Hag? Mathias Sammer, technical director at the time, explained he had been following the 'football-obsessed' ten Hag for a while, and that he was impressed by his personality and determination. Additionally, Bayern Munich II was aiming for promotion, something the then 43 year old Ten Hag had experience in.\n\nIn Munich, Ten Hag was in turn impressed and inspired by the even more 'football-obsessed' Pep Guardiola. Ten Hag shared Pep's passion for possession of the ball, but he was even more impressed by the fact that Guardiola was on top of everything, and that Pep decided on and kept track of even the tiniest of details. \n\nIt did not take long for Ten Hag to again achieve success, as Bayern Munich II successfully managed to fight for promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. He was happy to work with both Guardiola and Sammer, as he said that from every conversation he had with them he learnt something new. But he was up for a new adventure, as head coach. He was sought after following his success with Go Ahead Eagles, and even more so after working with Bayern's reserves. In the late 2015 spring, FC Utrecht proudly announced they had signed Ten Hag. Not only as manager, but also as technical director.\n\n**Coming to the Domstad**\n\nFC Utrecht at the time was an underachieving, financial mess. Though Utrecht is seen as the fourth city of the country, the local football club was definitely not seen as such. Having great success in the 2009/2010 season with stars Dries Mertens, Kevin Strootman, Michel Vorm and Ricky van Wolfswinkel, the club failed to achieve anything in the years after their departure. \n\nUnder the tutelage of local born (and former international) Jan Wouters and Rob Alflen (2011-2015), the club failed to achieve a position higher than #8 in five consecutive seasons. The only exception was 2012/2013 season, during which Utrecht played the Europa league qualifiers following a #5 finish, only to go out against Luxembourg(!) side Differdange. An absolute low in FC Utrecht history.\n\nTen Hag came to a club that was financially a mess, and far from professional. The training grounds were not up to par, players were often injured and not in shape, no one kept track of what the players were eating and the stadium wasn't as full as it used to be. FC Utrecht's stadium, the Galgenwaard, used to be a place other teams feared because of the atmosphere. To the dislike of the most loyal fans, that no longer seemed to be the case. The only highlight prior to Ten Hag seemed to be the French striker S\u00e9bastien Haller, who was signed on loan from Auxerre's reserve side. At least he managed to impress.\n\nTen Hag's ambitions were clear: it was time to put FC Utrecht back on the map, to fill the stadium and to play attractive football. Not in the 4-3-3 total football sense, but to make people *want* to come to the stadium. Something which was promised under previous coach Alflen, but who horribly failed. Fans were skeptic at first, but it did not take long for Ten Hag to win them over. How did he do this?\n\n**To make a club professional**\n\nComing to a side that's in shambles financially seems to be a classic case of a Football Manager dream. Find cheap talents, invest in your facilities 'et voila' - you're done. That seems to be exactly what Ten Hag did. \n\nThe training grounds were a mess, so Ten Hag wanted to find professional groundsmen for them - which the club found at the local golfclub. The training grounds used to be owned by the municipality, instead, the club now took care of them. \n\nFrom now on, the focus changed. Players were required to train multiple times a day, and the club had to strictly keep track of what players were eating. Ten Hag closely kept track of players movements, decisions and passes during games so he could properly analyse their performance. FC Utrecht, a sleepy 'club of the people', finally seemed to be making the steps required for a 21st century professional football club. \n\nTen Hag's passion and obsession inspired players, helping them achieve and perform much better compared to previous seasons. Whereas it used to be enough to beat Ajax once, maybe twice a season, the club's mentality had to be changed. Considering the lack of financial options to invest in players, the club had to invest in *everything else*. This was Ten Hag's first and most important step: changing the mentality, and investing in every little detail that could improve the club's performances. Clearly these were lessons learned from what Ten Hag saw at Pep's Bayern.\n\n**Finding the right tactics**\n\nThe Dutch league is known for it's naive, attacking football. Everyone plays 4-3-3, and when you don't, you're just flat out weird. Ten Hag was one of these weird managers that went his own way, forcing his team to play different tactics, but with basic rules.\n\nTen Hag chose to make his teams play structured, rigid football. Shots from outside the box had to be prevented, as did passing to the sides. Instead, he found space in what is called [*halfspaces*: the space in between the center of the pitch and the sidelines.](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/scisports-production/716783_387024ae9ff24fde970460a19844fa07.png)\n\nPlaying without wingers, who play a crucial role in Dutch tactics, seemed to be something against the Dutch nature. Instead, center backs were required to patiently pass the ball around up until one of the three or four midfielders was able to move into space, allowing further play to develop.\n\nAnother tactical element was that his strikers were required to defend. No, not in the center of the pitch. Instead, when defending, the most attacking midfielder of Utrecht moved up to the most attacking position, whereas the strikers stood in between the center backs and the fullbacks, restricting passing lanes and forcing the opposing team to play through the center. As Dutch teams are renowned for passing to their fullbacks, they struggled to compete against the tactically astute Ten Hag. This sort of defensive, rigid structure, also allowed the most attacking midfielder to lead the press, allowing FC Utrecht to quickly win the ball and create chances from a counter attack. [Check this picture describing the quality&amp;volume of chances to see what I mean](http://www.tussendelinies.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Erik-ten-Hag-Fc-Utrecht-2.png)\n\nThese basic rules allow Ten Hag's Utrecht to be tactically flexible, playing not with 'pure strikers' or 'pure wingers', instead training players into general, specific roles that were used within a variety of tactics. When playing tougher teams, Ten Hag would often switch to a 5-3-2, and switching to a 4-4-2 diamond during the game if need be. In short, Ten Hag brought something new to the Eredivisie: a tactically astute manager. Or, as he was soon called, 'the Utrecht Pep'.\n\n[Picture of tactics from Dutch website 'tussen de linies'](http://www.tussendelinies.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Erik-ten-Hag-Fc-Utrecht-1.png)\n\n\n[Read more about Ten Hag's tactics here](https://deanalyserendetrainer.wordpress.com/2017/06/22/de-tactiek-van-fc-utrecht-2016-2017/) (In Dutch but with pictures)\n\n**Improving players and finding talent**\n\nNext to bringing professionalism, determination and tactical aptitude, Ten Hag also seems to have a knack for finding talent and improving it. \n\nAlready having the gifted S\u00e9bastien Haller at his disposal following his purchase, Ten Hag also signed players who went on to perform amazing. Former Arsenal, Ajax and Monaco midfielder Nacer Barazite came on a free, who would go on to play a crucial role in the #10 position. Barazite, after a career of loans and being known as a failed talent, managed to perform wonderfully for the club. \n\nMidfielder Rico Strieder came from the Bayern Munich academy to become the Busquets of the Galgenwaard, whereas defender and 'enfant terrible' Timo Letschert was signed from Roda JC. Collectively, Utrecht spent very little.\n\nPlayers already present also impressed. Midfielder and captain Willem Janssen was retrained into the position of center back at the age of 29 as a ball playing defender. Striker Ruud Boymans, went on to become a supersub, often scoring after he came on from the bench. \n\nNew talent from the club was also brought into the first team. Sean Klaiber (21), Giovani Troup\u00e9e (17), Soufyan Amrabat (19), Bart Ramselaar (19) and Yassin Ayoub (21) all impressed, whereas Utrecht failed for years to use it's own academy properly. \n\nFollowing a #11 league position at the end of the 2014/2015 season, Ten Hag managed to get the club to the final of the KNVB beker (Dutch cup), and a #5 position in the league. FC Utrecht lost the cup final to Feyenoord and failed qualify for the Europa League qualifiers in the following play offs, but FC Utrecht managed to impress nonetheless. They were now a serious contender for the 'best of the rest' title, after finishing around the #10 position for several years in a row.\n\n[FC Utrecht's transfers](https://www.transfermarkt.com/fc-utrecht/alletransfers/verein/200)\n\n\n**The second season**\n\nTen Hag was eager to pick up where he left off in the 2016-2017 season. Bart Ramselaar was sold to PSV for \u20ac4.75 million, Timo Letschert to Sassuolo for \u20ac3 million and Ruud Boymans, the lucky charm in the 2015-2016 season, for \u20ac975.000. A side like FC Utrecht can't keep their players from leaving, so Ten Hag was prepared.\n\nThe manager was quick to move and signed former PSV and Sporting CP talent Zakaria Labyad on a free, experienced midfielder Wout Brama from PEC Zwolle and also the veteran left back Edson Braafheid. Ten Hag also brought in several players on loan from other clubs, such as Ajax's Richairo Zivkovic, making sure he had plenty of squad depth. \n\nWhile selling for over \u20ac9 million and spending little under \u20ac1 million, Ten Hag seemed to be able to strengthen his squad in spite of the financial restrictions.\n\nBart Ramselaar, who was so crucial for FC Utrecht in the previous season, was silently replaced by Soufyan Amrabat - who did just as well. Ruud Boymans, the supersub and lucky charm, was silently replaced by the loaned Richairo Zivkovic and youth player Gyrano Kerk. Whenever an established player left, Ten Hag quickly replaced them with an apt if not better replacement - for less money as well. Fan favorites were quickly forgotten, and praise in the form of chants went out to Ten Hag during games.\n\nFollowing a strong season FC Utrecht managed to make it to the #4 position in the league at the end of the season, finishing 11 points ahead of the number five, Vitesse. It was clear Utrecht earned the best of the rest position. At the end of the season, it was again time for the EL play-offs. \n\n**Hopes and dreams**\n\nIn order to be able to play the qualifiers, Utrecht had to defeat AZ Alkmaar over two games. The first game was played at the Alkmaar stadium, in which Utrecht absolutely bottled the match. AZ was dominant, successfully earning themselves a 3 - 0 victory. \n\nUtrecht fans were happy with Ten Hag, but saddened by this loss. All were convinced Utrecht would not be able to overcome this at home. If AZ scored one goal, FC Utrecht would have to score five! The stadium was packed, and all were excited. Perhaps there *would* be a chance. \n\n[Summary of the match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlqG2MrcyxU)\n\nAfter roughly ten minutes, free signing Labyad hit his free kick on the post, and FC Utrecht's captain (and newly trained defender) Willem Janssen scored the rebound. 1 - 0!  Utrecht was dominant, confident, and impressed. After 27 minutes, Haller managed to score the 2 - 0. It would take only one more to even the odds! The crowed was ecstatic, the stakes were high, and everyone felt what was going to happen. Assistant manager and club legend Jean Paul de Jong even got into a fight with the AZ assistant manager. \n\nMost telling however was the injury of Utrecht right back Giovanni Troup\u00e9e around the 50th minute. The youngster tore his hamstring, and cried as he couldn't finish the game. This however meant the most mediocre yet legendary player Mark van der Maarel came on. Imagine a crap Mark Noble.\n\nNot much later, an AZ player gets the red card. Utrecht continued to dominate, but couldn't score. Up until the 82th minute, in which captain Janssen scored with a mighty header following a corner. 3 -0! Utrecht evened the odds!\n\nUtrecht continued to apply pressure on AZ, and this resulted in a scramble in front of AZ's goal in the 93th minute. AZ fouled Labyad, but Utrecht scored! WE'RE THROUGH! But wait.. no? It's a foul! A penalty! \n\nWe all knew who would take that one. S\u00e9bastien Haller - he hadn't missed one in his entire career. But everyone also realized he was up against Tim Krul, the goalkeeper that thwarted Costa Rica's hopes and dreams during the 2014 World Cup. Krul had been wasting time all game, trying to get into player's heads. He tried again with Haller, kicking away the ball, shoving his opponent, and getting in his face. He was given the yellow card, and knew this was the last thing he'd do before the inevitable goal by Haller from the penalty spot. But, to everyone's surprise, the ever so cool Haller [*missed*](https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2017-05-28/tim-krul-haalt-haller-totaal-uit-concentratie-met-irritant-toneelstuk). The game had to go into extra time. All players were exhausted, so the extra time was of low quality. Luckily, Utrecht went on to win on penalties. All fans stormed the field following the final penalty and celebrated this incredibly and unlikely victory with the team.\n\n**What brings the new season?**\n\nAs is always the case for an Eredivisie side, a good season brings the exodus of good players. As was the case for Utrecht. Haller, Amrabat and Barazite all left, players who were so crucial to FC Utrecht. Losing a total of eight first squad players, Ten Hag went on to sign a total of *twelve* new players. Most notable among these were 'failed talent' Bilal Ould-Chikh and veteran Urby Emanuelson, both on a free. Emanuelson, who had rarely managed to complete a 90 minute game in his last three seasons or so, was voted in the Eredivisie XI of the week in his second Eredivisie game for Utrecht. The cost of these twelve players? [Only \u20ac1 million](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/fc-utrecht/transfers/verein/200).\n\nAs for the Europa League, Utrecht had to play very early on in the season as they were facing opponents for the Europa League qualifiers. First of those was Malta's Valetta, who were quickly disposed of. The second challenge was Polish side Lech Poznan, who Utrecht initially drew in a boring 0 - 0 match, but Utrecht managed to 'beat' Poznan in the away game with a [dramatic 2 - 2 late winner in extra time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB_qwgDvY2M) (seven minutes of added time!) by the newly signed striker Cyriel Dessers. Dessers, who had just signed for FC Utrecht from a second division side, was immediately embraced by the fans. Who is Haller?\n\nNext up was Zenit St. Petersburg, the final hurdle. Everyone knew Utrecht stood no chance, as the Russian millionaires had just spent a whopping \u20ac67 million (2/3 Pogba's, or 1/3 Mbapp\u00e9's) on transfers. Having players such as Ivanovic, Paredes, Mammana, Kranevitter, Criscito and Driussi all Utrecht fans were skeptical. Whereas Utrecht signs free agents and players from second division sides, Zenit is just below the European elite, and would definitely beat Utrecht with ease. Realizing that their coach was the experienced Roberto Mancini added even more to that impression.\n\nThe first game would be the home game, and boy was I wrong about the game. All fans expected a relatively good showing by Utrecht, but simple goals by Zenit. A fair, 0 - 2, 0 - 3 defeat would be more than acceptable. Instead, Utrecht [absolutely dominated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRYGD6_AuRA). \n\nZenit's manager Mancini, being lucky they only conceded one in their 1 - 0 defeat against Utrecht, complained that 'Utrecht's players had been playing together for a long time'. The irony couldn't be bigger as four of Utrecht's starters were new signings, and some of the other starting players had only signed for Utrecht one or two seasons before. After this incredibly victory, Utrecht unfortunately succumbed to nerves and Zenit's quality, ultimately losing 2 - 0 in extra time. As a fan, I was disappointed we missed out on the EL, but very proud as well.\n\nRussian journalists [applauded](https://fcutrecht.nl/ten-hag-doodzonde-dat-we-niet-scoorden/4) Ten Hag during the press conference after game, as his Utrecht side forced the Russian millionaires to finish the job in extra time. Ten Hag was asked if Utrecht's goal is to qualify for the Champions League this year, an objective Ten Hag soberly dismissed considering the budget differences with the top three, Feyenoord, Ajax and PSV.\n\n[FC Utrecht awaited by fans after Zenit defeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw_G48Q1rQ8)\n\nThe Eredivisie in turn started out with two wins and two clean sheets, only losing the third game against Groningen as it was several days after the defeat against Zenit. Utrecht was the far better side, but still lost - sadly.\n\n**So watch out!**\n\nTen Hag is building something impressive: taking a sleepy, poor provincial club to the best of the rest position in the Eredivisie, even impressing in Europe. Taking his lessons from Pep Guardiola, he professionalized the club, the staff and the players. Signing players who have attitude or performance issues (if not both), he manages to make players play some of the best football in their careers. Add that to his tactical aptitude, and he seems to have all the ingredients for a world class manager. People management, professionalism, determination and tactical awareness. Ajax also tried to sign Ten Hag following Peter Bosz' departure to Borussia Dortmund. Ten Hag kindly declined, as he wants to be in control of all aspects of the club, which he wouldn't be allowed to do at Ajax.\n\nOnce he signs for that big club, think back of this thread. Erik ten Hag.\n\n", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know what your initial response is. &amp;quot;Who? What club? The Eredivisie? Let&amp;#39;s not waste my time here.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it won&amp;#39;t be long before you&amp;#39;ll hear more about FC Utrecht&amp;#39;s coach, &lt;a href=\"https://dynamic.decorrespondent.nl/media/1920/57407533825fc5433181599.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Ten Hag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (47). I will explain to you why he&amp;#39;s the brightest prospect in the Dutch coaching world, and why you&amp;#39;ll most definitely hear more about him. Whether that&amp;#39;ll be in the Bundesliga, the Premier League or somewhere else I do not know, but FC Utrecht is definitely not his limit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teams managed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2006\u20132009 FC Twente (assistant)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2009\u20132012 PSV Eindhoven (assistant)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2012\u20132013 Go Ahead Eagles&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2013\u20132015 Bayern Munich II&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2015\u2013?????    FC Utrecht&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from the best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not many in the Netherlands had heard of Erik ten Hag when he managed to successfully fight for promotion with Dutch second division side Go Ahead Eagles, but journalists were impressed with this achievement nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were surprised however, when Ten Hag chose to go abroad to join Bayern Munich&amp;#39;s reserve side as their new manager. As were many in the Bavarian capital. Who the hell is Erik ten Hag? Mathias Sammer, technical director at the time, explained he had been following the &amp;#39;football-obsessed&amp;#39; ten Hag for a while, and that he was impressed by his personality and determination. Additionally, Bayern Munich II was aiming for promotion, something the then 43 year old Ten Hag had experience in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Munich, Ten Hag was in turn impressed and inspired by the even more &amp;#39;football-obsessed&amp;#39; Pep Guardiola. Ten Hag shared Pep&amp;#39;s passion for possession of the ball, but he was even more impressed by the fact that Guardiola was on top of everything, and that Pep decided on and kept track of even the tiniest of details. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It did not take long for Ten Hag to again achieve success, as Bayern Munich II successfully managed to fight for promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. He was happy to work with both Guardiola and Sammer, as he said that from every conversation he had with them he learnt something new. But he was up for a new adventure, as head coach. He was sought after following his success with Go Ahead Eagles, and even more so after working with Bayern&amp;#39;s reserves. In the late 2015 spring, FC Utrecht proudly announced they had signed Ten Hag. Not only as manager, but also as technical director.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming to the Domstad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FC Utrecht at the time was an underachieving, financial mess. Though Utrecht is seen as the fourth city of the country, the local football club was definitely not seen as such. Having great success in the 2009/2010 season with stars Dries Mertens, Kevin Strootman, Michel Vorm and Ricky van Wolfswinkel, the club failed to achieve anything in the years after their departure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under the tutelage of local born (and former international) Jan Wouters and Rob Alflen (2011-2015), the club failed to achieve a position higher than #8 in five consecutive seasons. The only exception was 2012/2013 season, during which Utrecht played the Europa league qualifiers following a #5 finish, only to go out against Luxembourg(!) side Differdange. An absolute low in FC Utrecht history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten Hag came to a club that was financially a mess, and far from professional. The training grounds were not up to par, players were often injured and not in shape, no one kept track of what the players were eating and the stadium wasn&amp;#39;t as full as it used to be. FC Utrecht&amp;#39;s stadium, the Galgenwaard, used to be a place other teams feared because of the atmosphere. To the dislike of the most loyal fans, that no longer seemed to be the case. The only highlight prior to Ten Hag seemed to be the French striker S\u00e9bastien Haller, who was signed on loan from Auxerre&amp;#39;s reserve side. At least he managed to impress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten Hag&amp;#39;s ambitions were clear: it was time to put FC Utrecht back on the map, to fill the stadium and to play attractive football. Not in the 4-3-3 total football sense, but to make people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to come to the stadium. Something which was promised under previous coach Alflen, but who horribly failed. Fans were skeptic at first, but it did not take long for Ten Hag to win them over. How did he do this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make a club professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to a side that&amp;#39;s in shambles financially seems to be a classic case of a Football Manager dream. Find cheap talents, invest in your facilities &amp;#39;et voila&amp;#39; - you&amp;#39;re done. That seems to be exactly what Ten Hag did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The training grounds were a mess, so Ten Hag wanted to find professional groundsmen for them - which the club found at the local golfclub. The training grounds used to be owned by the municipality, instead, the club now took care of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From now on, the focus changed. Players were required to train multiple times a day, and the club had to strictly keep track of what players were eating. Ten Hag closely kept track of players movements, decisions and passes during games so he could properly analyse their performance. FC Utrecht, a sleepy &amp;#39;club of the people&amp;#39;, finally seemed to be making the steps required for a 21st century professional football club. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten Hag&amp;#39;s passion and obsession inspired players, helping them achieve and perform much better compared to previous seasons. Whereas it used to be enough to beat Ajax once, maybe twice a season, the club&amp;#39;s mentality had to be changed. Considering the lack of financial options to invest in players, the club had to invest in &lt;em&gt;everything else&lt;/em&gt;. This was Ten Hag&amp;#39;s first and most important step: changing the mentality, and investing in every little detail that could improve the club&amp;#39;s performances. Clearly these were lessons learned from what Ten Hag saw at Pep&amp;#39;s Bayern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dutch league is known for it&amp;#39;s naive, attacking football. Everyone plays 4-3-3, and when you don&amp;#39;t, you&amp;#39;re just flat out weird. Ten Hag was one of these weird managers that went his own way, forcing his team to play different tactics, but with basic rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten Hag chose to make his teams play structured, rigid football.

Assistant manager and club legend Jean Paul de Jong even got into a fight with the AZ assistant manager. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most telling however was the injury of Utrecht right back Giovanni Troup\u00e9e around the 50th minute. The youngster tore his hamstring, and cried as he couldn&amp;#39;t finish the game. This however meant the most mediocre yet legendary player Mark van der Maarel came on. Imagine a crap Mark Noble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much later, an AZ player gets the red card. Utrecht continued to dominate, but couldn&amp;#39;t score. Up until the 82th minute, in which captain Janssen scored with a mighty header following a corner. 3 -0! Utrecht evened the odds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Utrecht continued to apply pressure on AZ, and this resulted in a scramble in front of AZ&amp;#39;s goal in the 93th minute. AZ fouled Labyad, but Utrecht scored! WE&amp;#39;RE THROUGH! But wait.. no? It&amp;#39;s a foul! A penalty! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all knew who would take that one. S\u00e9bastien Haller - he hadn&amp;#39;t missed one in his entire career. But everyone also realized he was up against Tim Krul, the goalkeeper that thwarted Costa Rica&amp;#39;s hopes and dreams during the 2014 World Cup. Krul had been wasting time all game, trying to get into player&amp;#39;s heads. He tried again with Haller, kicking away the ball, shoving his opponent, and getting in his face. He was given the yellow card, and knew this was the last thing he&amp;#39;d do before the inevitable goal by Haller from the penalty spot. But, to everyone&amp;#39;s surprise, the ever so cool Haller &lt;a href=\"https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nl/nieuws/lees/2017-05-28/tim-krul-haalt-haller-totaal-uit-concentratie-met-irritant-toneelstuk\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;missed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The game had to go into extra time. All players were exhausted, so the extra time was of low quality. Luckily, Utrecht went on to win on penalties. All fans stormed the field following the final penalty and celebrated this incredibly and unlikely victory with the team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What brings the new season?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As is always the case for an Eredivisie side, a good season brings the exodus of good players. As was the case for Utrecht. Haller, Amrabat and Barazite all left, players who were so crucial to FC Utrecht. Losing a total of eight first squad players, Ten Hag went on to sign a total of &lt;em&gt;twelve&lt;/em&gt; new players. Most notable among these were &amp;#39;failed talent&amp;#39; Bilal Ould-Chikh and veteran Urby Emanuelson, both on a free. Emanuelson, who had rarely managed to complete a 90 minute game in his last three seasons or so, was voted in the Eredivisie XI of the week in his second Eredivisie game for Utrecht. The cost of these twelve players? &lt;a href=\"https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/fc-utrecht/transfers/verein/200\"&gt;Only \u20ac1 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the Europa League, Utrecht had to play very early on in the season as they were facing opponents for the Europa League qualifiers. First of those was Malta&amp;#39;s Valetta, who were quickly disposed of. The second challenge was Polish side Lech Poznan, who Utrecht initially drew in a boring 0 - 0 match, but Utrecht managed to &amp;#39;beat&amp;#39; Poznan in the away game with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB_qwgDvY2M\"&gt;dramatic 2 - 2 late winner in extra time&lt;/a&gt; (seven minutes of added time!) by the newly signed striker Cyriel Dessers. Dessers, who had just signed for FC Utrecht from a second division side, was immediately embraced by the fans. Who is Haller?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next up was Zenit St. Petersburg, the final hurdle. Everyone knew Utrecht stood no chance, as the Russian millionaires had just spent a whopping \u20ac67 million (2/3 Pogba&amp;#39;s, or 1/3 Mbapp\u00e9&amp;#39;s) on transfers. Having players such as Ivanovic, Paredes, Mammana, Kranevitter, Criscito and Driussi all Utrecht fans were skeptical. Whereas Utrecht signs free agents and players from second division sides, Zenit is just below the European elite, and would definitely beat Utrecht with ease. Realizing that their coach was the experienced Roberto Mancini added even more to that impression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first game would be the home game, and boy was I wrong about the game. All fans expected a relatively good showing by Utrecht, but simple goals by Zenit. A fair, 0 - 2, 0 - 3 defeat would be more than acceptable. Instead, Utrecht &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRYGD6_AuRA\"&gt;absolutely dominated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zenit&amp;#39;s manager Mancini, being lucky they only conceded one in their 1 - 0 defeat against Utrecht, complained that &amp;#39;Utrecht&amp;#39;s players had been playing together for a long time&amp;#39;. The irony couldn&amp;#39;t be bigger as four of Utrecht&amp;#39;s starters were new signings, and some of the other starting players had only signed for Utrecht one or two seasons before. After this incredibly victory, Utrecht unfortunately succumbed to nerves and Zenit&amp;#39;s quality, ultimately losing 2 - 0 in extra time. As a fan, I was disappointed we missed out on the EL, but very proud as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russian journalists &lt;a href=\"https://fcutrecht.nl/ten-hag-doodzonde-dat-we-niet-scoorden/4\"&gt;applauded&lt;/a&gt; Ten Hag during the press conference after game, as his Utrecht side forced the Russian millionaires to finish the job in extra time. Ten Hag was asked if Utrecht&amp;#39;s goal is to qualify for the Champions League this year, an objective Ten Hag soberly dismissed considering the budget differences with the top three, Feyenoord, Ajax and PSV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw_G48Q1rQ8\"&gt;FC Utrecht awaited by fans after Zenit defeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Eredivisie in turn started out with two wins and two clean sheets, only losing the third game against Groningen as it was several days after the defeat against Zenit. Utrecht was the far better side, but still lost - sadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So watch out!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten Hag is building something impressive: taking a sleepy, poor provincial club to the best of the rest position in the Eredivisie, even impressing in Europe. Taking his lessons from Pep Guardiola, he professionalized the club, the staff and the players. Signing players who have attitude or performance issues (if not both), he manages to make players play some of the best football in their careers. Add that to his tactical aptitude, and he seems to have all the ingredients for a world class manager. People management, professionalism, determination and tactical awareness. Ajax also tried to sign Ten Hag following Peter Bosz&amp;#39; departure to Borussia Dortmund. Ten Hag kindly declined, as he wants to be in control of all aspects of the club, which he wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to do at Ajax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once he signs for that big club, think back of this thread. Erik ten Hag.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "subreddit_name_prefixed":
