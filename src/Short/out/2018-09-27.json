Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world\u2019s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY).\n\nPyramidion Technology Group, Inc.

(TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. \u201cAleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient\u2019s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,\u201d said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora.\n\nINSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. \u201cThis pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination\u2019s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,\u201d said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. \u201cIts completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.\u201d The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax\u2013\u2013the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma\u2013\u2013was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates Financialnewsmedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

Ask any investor who's been doing this long enough and they can tell you about a stock they hold onto too long. I know a common question is \"How do I know when to take profits?\" The honest answer is...there is no right answer, but there are many good answers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me give you an example of some profit taking I just did recently with AMD:\n\nI bought into AMD @ $10 with a price target of $30 and my time horizon was 3 years for it to hit that. Needless to say....it's already done so and a whole lot faster than I anticipated. Today it was $32 and I went into evaluation mode. \n\n\\- I asked myself these questions:\n\n1) Do I still believe in the reasons why I purchased this company **Answer: Yes**\n\n2) Do I still believe in their management? **Answer: Absolutely!**\n\n3) Now that it has eclipsed my price target should I adjust my target upward? **Answer: Yes.. by probably another 10 dollars**\n\n4) This is my big one... If AMD's price fell by 50% tomorrow, am I going to buy more shares....or sell?\n\n**Answer: I hesitated...then answered neither.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is because of my answer to #4 that I took some profits with AMD. I didn't sell my entire position however! Remember, I went from $10 per share to $32 per share so I had 3x the money I started with. Today I sold half my shares that I owned in AMD locking in a guarantee of a total profit of 50% of my initial investment. The other 50% of my shares that I kept, I can comfortably raise my price target to $42 and know that even if AMD tanked tomorrow and ceased to exist as a company, I will still have made a profit. If they shoot to the moon (cough)! I will still make more money on the company. \n\nSo remember. Taking profits is ok! And don't forget that taking profits doesn't mean you have to sell out of your entire position. :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 276670, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Don't be afraid to take profits!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9jepjf/dont_be_afraid_to_take_profits/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "otcninja", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1vfw91d0", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538080252, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9jgf8p/ahh_yes_dea_takes_cbd_off_schedule_1_all_related/", "gilded": 0, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9jgf8p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9jgf8p/ahh_yes_dea_takes_cbd_off_schedule_1_all_related/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1538080253, "score": 72, "selftext": "The Farm bill has not passed but the DEA took CBD off schedule 1.

Amazon supporters keep saying Amazon is not showing big profit because they simply are investing all the profits back into the business. Making massive investments.\n\nSo I decided to look at the 2017 10-K annual report for Amazon.\n\nGuess what? I can't find all the 'massive' investment.  Looking at the Cash Flow statement Amazon only had about $10 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development.  This is all under the 'Investment' section of the Cash flow statement. \n\nSo even if Amazon spend $0 on 'investment' their profit would only be $10 billion (amount shown in Cash flow statement for investment) plus the $3 billion in profit.  \n\nSo even if Amazon didn't 'invest its profits back into the business' and tried to maximize profits, they would only make $13 billion in profit last year.\n\n$13 billion in profit for a company worth $1 TRILLION. LOL.\n\nAnd the funny thing about this meme is people are assuming Amazon won't have to 'invest profits' into the company in the future when they decide to maximize profits. LOL. Wrong. They will have to continue to invest in fulfillment centers, data centers, tech, R&amp;D, ect indefinitely.   Those expenses won't just go away.\n\nOf course Amazon supports will say look at the money. Look at the HUGE gains AMZN stock has made.  True. But those past gains have no bearing on the future performance of the stock.  I can point to even more MASSIVE GAINS in Weed stocks and Krypto currency.  \n\nI'm not saying AMZN is a fraud company.

I have been trading stocks for several years now but I have avoided options. \n\nI would like to know what some of you think about placing a put option for a struck price of around $265 (Tesla is currently trading for about $270 after hours) tomorrow for Tesla as with everything going on I expect their share price to drop. I would want to place an order for a 1 day contract and sell before the contract expires.  I fully expect the put ask prices to skyrocket by tomorrow morning due to the response of the market to Elon Musk being sued after hours.\n\nI am wondering if it\u2019s a complete dumb idea to purchase the put contract as since there was already a drop of 13% after hours, is there much room for it to drop further? Would this even be profitable even and worth the risk? I know it is impossible to predict these things for certain I\u2019m just looking for input.\n\nThank you everyone for the help, and as I said i am a beginner when it comes to options (and reddit in general) so any advice is greatly appreciated.
