TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions:\n\n**Measure:** Is the security's price trending, has it dipped or is it a falling knife?  **Interpret:** Does the current price mean investors think it's undervalued or overvalued; when did they buy/sell more and why? **Predict:** If price reaches a certain point, will there be a rally or get rejected?\n\nThe main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as priced in):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.\n\nTA is best used for short term trading, but can also be used for long term.\n\nIntro to technical analysis by [Stockcharts chartschool](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators#benefits_and_drawbacks_of_leading_indicators) and their [article on candlesticks](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:introduction_to_candlesticks)\n\n**Terminology**\n\n* **Indicator** - a calculation based on price and/or volume, it can be displayed as a line/number on a chart or watch list; some indicators use statistics like standard deviation such as the Bollinger Bands indicator\n* **trade signals** - when an indicator tells you that a buy or sell (short) entry is available (also called buy signal or sell signal)\n* **lagging indicator** - based on past prices, for example the Moving Average indicator\n* **leading indicator** - typically oscillators which fluctuate from 0 to 100 and back, and these typically measure the rate of change; they also generate overbought, oversold, and divergence, all of which help create trade signals\n* **oversold** - a trade signal for when to buy, for example RSI below 30, however it's best to wait when the RSI line points upwards past 30 before buying\n* **overbought** - the opposite of oversold; for RSI it's above 70\n* **divergence** - when an indicator and stock price move inversely which foreshadows a coming change in the price\n* **whipsaw** - when trade signals &amp; price suddenly reverse either stopping you out or making you exit your trade\n* **resistance** - an area on a chart where [price can't seem to go higher](https://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/chart_analysis/trend_lines/trendlines-2amzn.png).  The main reason is that no one is willing to buy above that price or there's more sellers than buyers.\n* **support** - an area on a chart where price can't seem to go lower.  The main reason is no one is willing to sell below that price or there's more buyers than sellers.\n* **breakout/breakdown** - when price breaks support or resistance\n* **alerts** - a notification for when price hits your desired target, some software allows you to place the alert direction on a chart\n* **level ii** - This shows all bid &amp; ask orders from market makers, usually your broker charges a fee for this, and is only really usual for day trading\n* **trend line** - can be a moving average, previous day's high, an indicator, you can even draw a line connecting all the highs or [lows for example](https://d.stockcharts.com/school/data/media/chart_school/chart_analysis/trend_lines/trendlines-1emc.png)\n* [**Market participants**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/institutional-effect.asp) - also includes [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp), institutions, and retail &amp; institutional investors.  Different markets have different participants such as futures (hedgers &amp; speculators) and forex (banks &amp; speculators).\n\n**Useful indicators**\n\n* **Moving average (MA)** - lagging indicator that averages previous prices, for example MA 20 will average the previous 20 days; MAs do not predict price movements, they smooth out price changes.  Common averages are 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200.  Typically you use 2 to 3 per chart.\n* **RSI** - relative strength index, takes the average gain of the stock price divided by the average loss over a number of periods, default 14; starts to reverse when it points down from 70 (sell signal) and reverses agian when it points up from 30 (buy signal)\n* **VWAP** - intraday indicator, takes the average price and weighs it by volume, basically you want to be short below VWAP and go long above VWAP; near the VWAP line (or price) there can be lots of whipsaw\n* **MACD** - combines momentum &amp; trend indicators; gives off many trade signals including ovebought/sold and divergence, [see link here](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd) note that the histogram in the center shows how wide the MACD &amp; Signal line are from each other\n* **ATR** - Average true range gives a number that tells you how wide price movements are, great for helping set stops.  ATR on a daily chart of 5 means average price movement of 5 points, typically you would have a stop loss 2x ATR so in this case it would be 10 point wide stop.  If a stop loss of 2x ATR is too high for you, then trade a different stock.\n* **Bollinger Bands (BB)** - takes the standard deviation of price times 2 (default); in statistics, 95% of all values are within 2 standard deviations.  BB is typically used for resistance and support, [more info here.](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands)\n* **Ichimoku clouds** - Combines even more indicators, good for beginners, [see here](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud)\n\n**Methods or Systems**\n\n* **Trend Following** - Basically you're buying shares as a stock is going up or shorting as it's going down.  [Investopedia's intro to trend trading.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/041814/four-most-commonlyused-indicators-trend-trading.asp)\n* **Fading** - shorting as price falls from resistance, or buying as price rises from support\n* **Channels** - very much like fading except you find 2 parallel trend lines that price has been bouncing between, [see here](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:price_channel_continuation)\n* **Patterns** - Double tops, head &amp;

Flannery was fired in October 2018 and replaced with the former CEO of Danaher Larry Culp. Larry Culp is the first outside executive to run GE in history.\n\n2 \u2013 Credit rating \n\nGE credit rating was downgraded in October 2018 after John Flannery was fired. GE\u2019s credit rating was cut was from A to BBB+ and is only three notches about speculative, or \u201cjunk\u201d status. Credit derivatives such as credit default spreads (CDS) are widening in bond markets.\n\n3 \u2013 Dividend cut\n\nNew CEO Larry Culp immediately cut dividend to $0.01 per share, reducing GE\u2019s dividend yield from over 5% to nearly zero. This is the only the third GE dividend cut since the Great Depression, once seen as a symbol of its stability. There are over 400,000 GE retirees that were negatively impacted as they relied on dividend income from GE.\n\n4 \u2013 Capital allocation\n\nGE has a terrible track record of capital allocation in recent years. Aside from poor acquisitions, the company spent nearly $24 billion on stock repurchases in 2016 &amp; 2017 at nearly $29 per share, or at a price that that is NEARLY FOUR TIMES the current stock price.\n\n5 \u2013 Financial performance\n\n2018 will be the fourth consecutive year that GE EBITDA (Earnings Before Taxes, Interest, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) will decline. Estimated to decline by 12% this year led by GE\u2019s Power business, which accounts for about 25% of 2018 revenues.\n\n6 \u2013 Bad acquisitions\n\nGE\u2019s poor capital allocation extends to its acquisition track record. In fact, under former CEO Jeff Immelt from 2001 to 2017, GE made 380 acquisitions at a cost of over $175 billion, with many ill-timed energy acquisitions such as Alstom in 2015.\n\n7 \u2013 Federal investigations\n\nThe SEC and Justice Department are investigating GE\u2019s power business for its $22 billion accounting write-down in October 2018. This follows a January 2018 announcement by the SEC that it was investigating GE\u2019s accounting tactics and a $6.2 billion insurance loss that caught investors off guard.\n\n8 \u2013 Wall Street bears piling on\n\nSales sold short, betting against GE\u2019s stock price, has risen nearly 30% over the past 2 months despite a 40%+ decline in the share price.\n\n9 \u2013 GE Capital\n\nGE Capital disclosed a surprise $15 billion reserve shortfall related to a legacy long-term-care insurance business, and concerns about additional funding shortages are growing.\n\n10 \u2013 Liquidity is not concern\n\nGE has access to liquidity with cash on its balance sheet and nearly $40 billion in credit lines while it deleverages its balance sheet through asset sales.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 300307, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "10 Reasons Why GE is a BAD investment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a5aztq/10_reasons_why_ge_is_a_bad_investment/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "pathoang21", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_enggs05", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1544545135, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a587oi/sticking_with_what_you_know_or_diversify/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "a587oi", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/a587oi/sticking_with_what_you_know_or_diversify/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1544545135, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to stocks and some understanding what types of investments are out there.

We've all seen the news about peak iPhone, China worries, ect.  All those are true. For me the bull case for AAPL comes down to one thing: BUYBACK.\n\nWith the new tax rules, Apple's cash is no longer stuck overseas. They have full access to the $250 billion in the bank without paying additional taxes. The Apple CFO already said they were committed to going cash flow neutral. In other words have enough cash to cover long term debt. As of last quarter Apple had about $125 billion in net cash.\n\nLast year AAPL generated $77 billion in cash flow from operations. They paid $14 billion in dividends. Bottom line is Apple is generating mountain loads of cash and they will continue to generate $60-$75 billion in free cash flow from operations for many years.\n\nThink Long Term.\n\nLets say worse case the share price stays flat or even drops another 10-20% the next year. Could easily happen. But that actually helps not hurts the bull case of buybacks. It means Apple has buyback more shares at cheaper prices.  \n\nIf Apple stays at about $800 billion market cap Apple should be able to buy a huge chunk of shares the next 10 years.\n\nApple has $150 billion in cash to buy shares right now.\n\nApple generated $77 billion in free cash flows from operations last year. Even if profits/sales stay flat or even drop 5%-10%, they would still be generating over $70 billion in cash a year.  Lets be conservative and say Apple uses $30 billion on dividends and investments a year. That leaves over $40 billion a year for buyback.\n\n10 years x $40 billion = $400 billion + $125 billion in current cash.\n\nApple could buy 66% of the outstanding shares if the stock price remained flat. And over 70% if the stock dropped.  Apple could even get more aggressive and spend an additional $50 billion and just hold a larger debt/asset ratio.  They could buy 75% of outstanding shares.  And what if Apple actually grows revenue/profit?\n\nIf Apple buys 75% of its shares and the company's market cap is flat at $800 billion, the price of the shares will go up 400%.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 300280, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bull case for AAPL", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a5a3rf/bull_case_for_aapl/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "EcloVideos", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7radt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1544568987, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a5c1mv/archetypes_financial_bubbles_psychological_guide/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "a5c1mv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/a5c1mv/archetypes_financial_bubbles_psychological_guide/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1544568988, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\n## We Think In Archetypes\n\nThe interesting aspect of humankind is that we act in accordance\u00a0with\u00a0both our conscious mind and our unconscious. We try to [find our life purpose](https://www.worldpowerdesigns.com/blogs/focus-reasoning-discipline-heart/how-to-find-your-life-purpose) but instead we can be lead off course at times. The scientific evidence does find that we are unknowingly affected by our unconscious, even though it does affect our behaviors and decisions we make (Dijksterhus et. Al. (2005), Augsto (2010), Bargh, et. Al. (2008)). However, the tricky part is that the unconscious mind is much harder to track as we live our lives and it typically can only be observed in hindsight. If we are to attempt to track our unconscious mind, we must identify patterns and behaviors that the conscious mind displays. Famous psychologist Carl Jung invented the idea of archetypes to describe our repeated use of symbols and motifs in literature, art, or mythology to display our unconscious thoughts.\n\n[Archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype): The concept of an archetype appears in areas relating to behavior, modern psychological theory, and literary analysis. An archetype can be a statement, a pattern of behavior, or prototype which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate.\n\nWe can use these archetypes to predict all kinds of behavior, even the financial market, as this is largely emotion based and can be affected by societal norms and trends.\n\n## Breaking Down Archetypes\n\nJung argues that archetypes are the basis of our cultural shifts and societal trends. Science has backed his claims with surprisingly high amounts of congruity to his theories. Archetypes can be categorized as certain philosophies or personality traits that we stereotypically follow as general guides in our lives. These personalities can be assigned to most anything human-made, for example here are the archetypes and their relating company archetypal assignments:\n\n### Here are the definitions of each archetype:\n\n* **The Innocent**: \u201cwants to be happy\u201d An innocent brand will never try to aggressively sell you on anything. Instead, it will try to reel you in on the idea of nostalgia.\n* **The Hero**: \u201cwants to prove himself\u201d The hero will attempt to make the world better by simply being the best. They don\u2019t resemble mother like characteristics of nurture, instead, it presents a more masculine trait of challenging you and giving you help when you need it most.\n* **The Regular Guy**: \u201cwants to belong\u201d The regular guy attempts to appeal to everyone and refuses to be pretentious or unique. It is the most difficult archetype to pull off because, in order for a company to present the regular guy archetype, they must appeal across demographics.\n* **The Caregiver**: \u201cwants to nurture\u201d Benevolent and simply wants to be there for you. They won\u2019t run advertisements that take shots at competitors, and these brands build trust. Tend to be companies that state they are \u2018a family company\u2019.\n* **The Creator**: \u201cwants to be perfect\u201d A creator makes things at scale and doesn\u2019t worry about the cost of things. Creators strive to make products you feel you can\u2019t live without and tend to have cult followings.\n* **The Explorer**: \u201cwants to be free\u201d Explorer brands want you to break free of what we might consider home and go everywhere. Subaru is an example of the explorer archetype as they focus on the freedom to go anywhere no matter the weather conditions.\n* **The Rebel**: \u201cwants a revolution\u201d The rebels aren\u2019t afraid to go where no brand has gone before. In fact, they want to go where no one dares go, and they desire a cult following similar to Apple.\n* **The Lover**: \u201cwants you to be theirs\u201d Pleasure, passion, and sensuality are the main characteristics to the lover\u2019s heart. These brands like to be associated with the intimate moments in life and indulging on your significant other.\n* **The Ruler**: \u201cwants absolute power\u201d These brands represent luxury and exclusivity. Their perception is vital to their success and they demand to be seen as high-quality. Jewelry and high-end vehicles fall under this category.\n* **The Jester**: \u201cwants to live in the moment\u201d Characteristics of the jester involve humor, silliness, and nonsense. They want to make you smile and laugh. Other examples besides Skittles is the Old Spice Man ad campaign. By joking about masculinity, they appeal to both consumers whether or not they appeal to masculine or non-masculine products.\n* **The Magician**: \u201cwants dreams to come true\u201d Magician brands help make your wildest dreams come true. They don\u2019t attempt to make life\u2019s dullness easier, they instead go around this and jump to giving you the impossible.\n* **The Sage**: \u201cwants the truth\u201d Wisdom is key to success to the sage, and the pursuit of knowledge is the goal. They don\u2019t have the same mystical vibe as the magician but instead command respect by illustrating brilliance.\n\n## America and Capitalism\n\nCapitalism and politics are major intrinsic parts of this nation. America has played into the non-rational impulses of the stock market and economy at large. These financial bubbles that spur mania at their heights and subsequent panics after the popping of the bubble \u201cplay a major part in collective human investment behavior\u201d (Hageback). It is important to attempt to forecast the growth of bubbles as they produce great social and political unrest. Ben Graham, father of fundamental analysis, and investor Warren Buffet coined the name \u201cmanic-depressive Mr. Market\u201d to describe market bubbles. John Maynard Keynes referred to them as animal spirits, and US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan mentions them as \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. Scholarly journal author Niklas Hageback writes his article with the context of Carl Jung\u2019s work stating: \u201cif these theories could be adapted into arithmetic expressions it would allow for statistical testing against the unfolding price patterns of financial bubbles\u201d.\n\n## The Collective Human Investment Behavior\n\nJung\u2019s research pointed him to additional dimensions of the mind. These additional dimensions are:\n\n**The Personal**: unique to each individual.\n\n* The personal unconscious is defined by Jung as \u201clost memories, painful ideas that are repressed (i.e. forgotten on purpose), subliminal perceptions, by which are meant sense-perceptions that were not strong enough to reach consciousness, and finally, contents that are not yet ripe for consciousness\u201d (Jung \\[1981a\\], vol 9, para. 103).\n\n**The Collective**: a form of public opinion.\n\n* The collective is a combination of the \u201caverage person\u2019s cultural and moral values into a set of societal beliefs, norms, attitudes, and mainstream politicalisms\u201d (Hageback).\n\nJung argues that we are not born as a blank slate, and instead there are innate universal patterns that reside in our unconscious and that these patterns influence our thoughts and behaviors. This can have a biological base as genetic memories which have been coded into our DNA to survive over the millennia\u2019s humans have existed.\n\n## These Patterns are Archetypes.\n\n* These archetypes stem from *dreams, fantasies, hallucinations, visions, folklore, sagas, myths, and legends.*\n\n**The Three Categories of Archetypes: as stated by Hageback &amp; Stevens**\n\n1. **Events**: Typical situations in life such as birth, death, rites of initiation, or marriage.\n2. **Characters**: Some of these include the mother, the father, the child, god, the wise man, and the hero.\n3. **Objects**: Including elements such as water, the moon, the sun, fire; animals such as the snake and the fish; and also, numerals and man-made objects such as the plow or the sword (Stevens, 2006).\n\nThis all stems from the idea that our minds are constantly trying to find equilibrium. The argument by Jung lays out that our minds will attempt to use archetypes to replace old conscious perceptions of reality with new ones, and the archetypes will then disappear after the unconscious finds equilibrium. The problem America seems to have is that our society keeps running itself into psychological imbalance through extrapolating momentum. This can be seen in the stock market whose collective behavior exhausts itself and pushes itself into the extremes. New norms are formed through this imbalance, and some of our desires become unacceptable by dominant conventions and norms.\n\n## What Activates these Mysterious Archetypes?\n\nNew innovations like A.I. or internet companies during the dot.com bubble \u201cin some way drastically changes the way reality needs to be perceived, rendering existing psychical notions less suitable, and thus to be able to cope with reality, activations of archetypes deemed more suitable are initiated\u201d (Hageback).\n\nSo, therefore, we can start to see archetypes as humanity\u2019s way of psychologically handling a civilization of millions. Humans were initially tribal and had small groups of people that they would see for their entire lives. In today\u2019s world, the things that connect us and maintain equilibrium around the world are common myths that rise into godlike territory that humans have deemed they cannot cross.\n\n* **Example**: the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. is an interesting experiment and idea of which we are one country united by 50 statehoods that all collectively abide by this constitution that we have deemed no one, not even the president of the United States, can rise above. This is similar to God in that we have determined that these things are above us and we can never attain power like the constitution or God. Continuing, these 50 states all are independent and thus, we have 50 simultaneous experiments running under the same myth so that even if 5 states are corrupted, the system can live on with some semblance of equilibrium and eventually bring those corrupted states back into the union (see The American Civil War).\n\n## The Consequences\n\nFlare-ups of societal unrest can turn into demonstrations which turn into riots which turns into revolutions which turns into war if left unchecked by our collective energy and archetypes. We can forecast this behavior because these patterns exist from within us as a country. We simply must follow the cultural trends, and the financial market is the fastest way to determine trends in America. We can watch it in real time on the stock market exchange. We have even developed systems to monitor this change, and we call those indexes; collective repositories of the health of many companies that are considered leaders and can indicate a change in trends.\n\n\u201c**Projections, obsessions with certain themes, hysteria, and panics, are easily recognizable features in financial markets\u201d (Hageback)**\n\nProjections are an interesting development of archetypes that are characterized by the need to reduce anxiety and create a scapegoat by pinning the consequences of any such negative action on to any person, group, object, theme, or situation that is the subject of the projection.\n\n**Zeitgeists**: the general societal mood, the collective conscious in Jungian parlance.\n\n## The Financial Markets\n\nBubbles form when Keynes\u2019s \u201canimal spirits\u201d are high. We see that na\u00efve optimism followed by rejection of naivety are the cornerstones of a bubble at its riskier phase. [There are four phases of a bubble](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035):\n\n### The Four Phases of a Bubble:\n\n1. **Stealth Phase**: The investors that tend to have access to information and understand markets better than most see the merging opportunity and invest their assets into this rising trend market.\n2. **Awareness Phase**: When other investors start to take notice of the momentum and push prices higher. The stealth phase investors take this opportunity to reinforce its investment.\n3. **Mania Phase**: When the public takes notice of what is happening, and they all jump onto the trend hoping to make a large sum of money. This is where a frenzy starts, and investors\u2019 greed can start to quietly pull out and retain their assets.\n4. **Blow-Off Phase**: This is when everyone collectively realizes the situation they\u2019re in. The paradigm shifts and many try to sell or unload their assets, however by now, there are few buyers. This is when the bubble pops and the market crashes.\n\nAfterward, there are investigations into what went wrong, but the damage is there, and the market is hurt.\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nA common mistake that occurs is during the mania phase the valuation of the asset is exaggerated. This is where any news whether it\u2019s good or bad, is interpreted by investors as validation of the price level they are buying it at. This where investors desperately attempt to rationalize the exaggerated valuation. Hageback states \u201cthe most ardent proponents of the rationalism of this new paradigm that underpins the financial bubble are generally people most easily susceptible to hysteria or other neurotic conditions\u201d. These fluctuations in the market resemble a noise signal which is explained in [signal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)). The market is binary in nature like that of archetypes where it is either dormant or active ([Bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) versus [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp)). During the dot-com bubble, the thought process behind the poor investment strategy is as follows:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Internet companies were seen as gambles that if one gambled enough, invested into enough companies, they would get lucky and make up for the losses.\n\n## How To Determine Symbols In Order To Identify Archetypes and Trends\n\n1. Focus on English speaking media.\n2. Include national, regional and global coverage.\n3. Note that political directions and affiliations are not dictated by the archetypes.\n4. Symbolic language is symbolic language. It does not matter whether or not it is in support or against a certain topic.\n5. Do not limit your search to just financial and political news.\n6. It does not matter what tense (past, present, future) the language is being used in.\n7. It does not matter if the symbolic word is used in an ironic manner. The unconscious does not consider negations.\n8. Make sure to count the repetitions of symbols that reside in the same body of text.\n9. It does not matter whether or not the symbol words is used in a singular or plural form.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThis abstract idea of archetypes is initially difficult to understand as it requires us to delve deep into the unconscious. The unconscious is inherently abnormal to think about as we perceive reality in the conscious mind. However, by studying how we behave and especially how we collectively behave, we can forecast where humanity will turn to next. These cultural shifts can predict not only the personal unconscious decision we make but the collective unconscious decisions we make even to the point of predicting the inflation and deflation of bubbles in the financial market. I encourage you to read more about Carl Jung\u2019s work and continue to think differently.\n\n\\- WPD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Citations**:\n\n1. Hageback, N. (2017).

It's pretty much free money. A Dutch startup called BUX is launching a *free stock trading app* somewhere in the first few months of 2019. They have a website where you can sign up on a waiting list (like a pre-register). All you need to do is drop your e-mail address. Anyone that signs up on their waiting list **gets a free share up to a value of \u20ac100** in their app when it launches.
