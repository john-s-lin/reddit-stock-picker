You have General Michael Hayden, a retired four-star general who served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (2006-2009) and the National Security Agency (1999-2005), and Michael Chertoff, former director of Homeland Security, and co-author of the Patriot Act, on the advisory board.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of February 12th, 2018!\n\n# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks and bonds can both go down in volatile trading following wildest week in two years** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/stocks-and-bonds-can-both-go-down-in-volatile-trading-following-wildest-week-in-two-years.html)*\n\n*****\n\n&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.\n*****\n&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks come off a punishingly volatile week ready for more selling as the market continues to search for a floor and stock investors keep an eye on rising interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 5.2 percent to 2,619, its worst week of trading since January 2016. The Dow, also off 5.2 percent, and the S&amp;P both saw their first 10 percent correction since early 2016.\n*****\n&gt; Culprits behind the selling were an ugly shakeout in funds that bet against market volatility and the building pressure of higher interest rates on stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields for the 10-year note and 30-year bond were slightly higher on the week, but the 2-year was lower at 2.05 percent. Rising yields pressured stocks, but when stocks sold off, investors turned to the Treasury market as a safe haven. That in turn sent rates back down, since yields move opposite price. The 10-year was at 2.85 percent Friday, below its 2.88 percent high for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Despite extremely wide swings and days with 1,000-point Dow losses, stock strategists are mostly looking for the market to bottom soon and expect stocks will ultimately adjust to rising interest rates. But that process could be rocky, with many bond strategists now seeing the 10-year yield at 3 percent or above, much sooner than expected.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who has long been looking for a correction, said he expects that a good buying level would be at about 2,500 on the S&amp;P 500 and 3 percent on the 10-year yield.\n*****\n&gt; \"My gut here is 2,500 and 3 percent on the 10-year. They are big, big levels. You expect the market to find a reason to buy at that particular moment,\" he said.\n*****\n&gt; The markets in the week ahead will focus on their own action, particularly the tensions between stocks and bonds, but there are a few key data points that could impact trading. The CPI, consumer price index, is released Wednesday and it is an important inflation reading that investors are watching for any surprise pickup in inflation. That is released Wednesday morning, as are January retail sales.\n*****\n&gt; \"The next big event we know that's on the calendar is CPI, and that could impact the Fed. The next big date for the bond market after that, assuming stocks calm down, which is a shaky assumption, is the 28th, when [Fed chair Jerome] Powell testifies,\" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; Powell started as Fed chair this past week, and markets have been anxious to hear his views on market volatility. Powell testifies before Congress Feb. 28, and the Fed is expected to raise rates at its next meeting in March. But market pros are watching the volatility, and there's a view the Fed holds off on that hike if the turbulence persists.\n*****\n&gt; Bond yields have been rising as global central banks, including the Fed, step back from easy policies and raise rates. Treasury yields have also been rising as investors eye the steep increase in U.S. Treasury issuance, expected to rise to $1.25 trillion this year. Another big catalyst for the market is the improvement in global growth and the potential for inflation to rise as a result.\n*****\n&gt; Now the stock and bond markets are so closely correlated, the action in one feeds off the other. Stocks will be a big factor for bonds in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Gluskin Sheff and Associates' David Rosenberg said, in a note Friday, that the fact both stocks and bonds are selling off at the same time is unusual, and it is similar to time periods with significant market turmoil. He noted that the 10-year yield was rising as the S&amp;P fell sharply Thursday, down more than 10 percent from its January record high.\n*****\n&gt; \"I cannot tell you how rare a market condition this is \u2014 that yields are rising into this risk pullback,\" he wrote in a note to clients Friday. Rosenberg cited how bonds rallied during the financial crisis in 2008 when the market fell and during other big corrections. Other times were 1987 and 1994.\n*****\n&gt; As for currency markets, the U.S. dollar had a powerful week, with the dollar index rising 1.3 percent, its best week since October. As the dollar rose, oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate losing 9.9 percent for the week to just above $59.20 per barrel, its worst week in two years.\n*****\n&gt; Hartnett expects a rising dollar and other de-risking moves will be necessary before the shakeout in stocks ends.\n*****\n&gt; \"Maybe we need to see the dollar move up, and that's the thing that causes investors to do things they least like to do: sell winners \u2014 tech, high yield, emerging markets. In these corrections, you sell hubris and buy humiliation. One measure of humiliation is everything goes through the wringer. Nothing is left unscathed,\" he said. \"The dollar rally would be the ultimate risk off. That's part and parcel of the story.\"\n*****\n&gt; Earnings in the week ahead include consumer companies, such as Pepsi on Tuesday and Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup on Friday. Some energy names also report, such as Diamond Offshore on Monday and Occidental Petroleum on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; JP Morgan strategists, in a late Friday note, said they believe that commodity trading advisors and risk parity hedge funds were at the core of the correction, but they believe that most of the unwind by those investors is over.\n*****\n&gt; \"This, combined with the low equity exposures of Discretionary Macro and Equity Long/Short hedge funds, leaves retail investors as the main residual risk for equity markets going forward,\" they wrote in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Unlike in other corrections, many strategists said they did not see a fundamental reason behind the selling, and the market became hostage to big round technical numbers that seemed to drive trading. After breaking the 50- and 100-day moving averages, the S&amp;P 500 bounced off the closely watched 200-day moving average Friday, at 2,538, and rebounded to close 1.5 percent higher.\n*****\n&gt; \"There's a little bit of ... technical activity around what is happening with volatility and how hedge funds have to readjust their strategies, given where volatility is,\" said Patrick Palfrey, equities strategist with Credit Suisse. \"Going forward, we're not really seeing a point where the economic cycle is coming to an end and with the earnings backdrop as strong as it is, volatility should come back in over the next couple of weeks, as people start to look more closely at those underlying factors.\"\n*****\n&gt; Hartnett said there were plenty of warnings the correction was coming.\n*****\n&gt; \"Certainly, the first tremors were the very rate-sensitive areas of the equity markets \u2014 utilities, the REITs, the homebuilders which ... reminded people of the famous phrase 'fear of missing out.' Whether it was FOMO, or BTD, 'buy the dip,' or TNA, 'there is no alternative,' all these acronyms come back in vogue, and that's always going to be a dangerous moment,\" said Hartnett.\n\n*****\n\n*[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/stocks-and-bonds-can-both-go-down-in-volatile-trading-following-wildest-week-in-two-years.html)*\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/VqkFGV5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aLRrptA.png)**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ghr7TZL.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3cim9AC.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8mTCBnG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/20jdZyV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KIbN0D7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1gSGoEU.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 Resets Correction Clock with 10.2% Decline\n\n&gt; In just 13 calendar days, from its January 26 closing high through yesterday\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 declined 10.2%\u2014an official correction. Should yesterday\u2019s closing low hold, it will be the quickest correction by S&amp;P 500 going back to 1949. The second quickest correction was 18 calendar days in autumn 1955 when S&amp;P 500 shed 10.6%.\n\n&gt; Using a 20% peak to trough decline to define a bear market, the current bull market is 3259 calendar days old today, nearly twice as long as average since 1949. The current bull is also the second longest, surpassed by only the great bull market that closed out the last millennium. The current correction is the fourth of the current bull market which is comparable to the numbers recorded by previous bull markets of similar duration.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://78.media.tumblr.com/d5e84b6916e409fe6d7cd858028098cd/tumblr_inline_p3w8yza9Hw1spdppr_1280.jpg))**\n\n&gt; The path to recovery from this correction could be slow, but it is only February 9 and over ten and a half moths remain in 2018. Plenty of time remains for the market to finish the year with a gain. The positive implications of past big Januarys and a positive January Trifecta could still be realized.\n\n&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 does not have a good record when it comes to forecasting the next recession. Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&amp;P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections including the current one. Since the future is unknown, we will exclude the current correction meaning there have been 34 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to approximately 1 recession out of 3 S&amp;P 500 declines in excess of 10%.\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Corrections\n\n&gt; After nearly two years without one, the S&amp;P 500 officially entered correction territory yesterday, falling 10.2% from its 1/26/18 all-time closing high. The current correction represents the 96th decline of 10%+ from a closing high that followed a gain of at least 10%. The chart below shows the magnitude of every prior correction for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928. Not including the current period, the median decline for the S&amp;P 500 in the 95 prior corrections was a decline of 16.4% over the course of 64 days. Keep in mind, though, that these are median levels. There have been a number of corrections (13) that saw declines of less than 11%, while several saw deeper declines of more than 20%. In terms of length, prior corrections have also been all over the map. Some have lasted as little as three days, while others have stretched on for well over a year.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule when it comes to corrections, and that\u2019s what can make them so terrifying when you go through one. You never know when it will end. Throughout history, market corrections have \u2018typically\u2019 occurred a little more than once per year. As mentioned above, there have been 96 corrections since 1928, but if you look at their distribution over time, a good deal of them were clustered around the Great Depression. If we look just at the post-WWII period, there have been 55 corrections in the span of 73 years, reducing their frequency to once about every 16-17 months. In any event, the market was still overdue for a correction heading into the current one, but maybe not by as much as it seemed on the surface.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/020918-Corrections-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# How Much Are Individual Stocks Down From Their 52-Week Highs?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is currently down about 8.5% from its 52-week high less than two weeks ago, but the average stock in the S&amp;P 500 is now down 14.3% from its respective 52-week high. That may seem like a pretty wide discrepancy, but it\u2019s actually pretty common for the individual stock reading to be much lower than the index itself due to the fact that not all stocks hit 52-week highs at the same time as the index. In fact, you rarely even see a third of stocks hit an all-time high on the same day.\n\n&gt; While the \u2018average\u2019 stock is down 14.3%, the vast majority of stocks are down less than the average \u2013 328 to be exact. Of those 328 names, 170 are still down less than 10% from their respective highs. So who is currently the biggest loser in the S&amp;P 500? That title belongs to Range Resources (RRC). At a current price of $13.16, RRC is down over 60% from its 52-week high. Behind RRC, there are three other stocks down over 50%. They are Chesapeake (CHK), General Electric (GE), and Envision Healthcare (EVHC). The demise of GE has certainly been a major fall from grace. While the stock didn\u2019t perform well under the leadership of Jeff Immelt, it hasn\u2019t been any better since he left. In fact, since Immelt officially retired on October 2nd, 2017, GE shares are down more than 40%!\n\n&gt; On the upside, shares of Scripps Networks (SNI) have been holding up better than any S&amp;P 500 stock as they are down less than 2% from their 52-week highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/020817-Decliens-from-52-week-highs-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis for February 9th 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwFcfsVEv_E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BIDU** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$ANET** \n&gt; * **$WB** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$GRPN** \n&gt; * **$FDC** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$L** \n&gt; * **$CGNX** \n&gt; * **$DE** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$SINA** \n&gt; * **$APRN** \n&gt; * **$IPGP** \n&gt; * **$HIMX** \n&gt; * **$MET** \n&gt; * **$CYBR** \n&gt; * **$ABX** \n&gt; * **$MRO** \n&gt; * **$CTL** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$MZOR** \n&gt; * **$INCY** \n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$CNA** \n&gt; * **$DO** \n&gt; * **$FMC** \n&gt; * **$TECK** \n&gt; * **$QSR** \n&gt; * **$PI** \n&gt; * **$OHI** \n&gt; * **$RPD** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$NSP** \n&gt; * **$KGC** \n&gt; * **$CVE** \n&gt; * **$FANG** \n&gt; * **$CBS** \n&gt; * **$SODA**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/YPE0KHZ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UHGEpvy.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the most notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming week ahead which includes the time of release &amp; estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers.\n\n*****\n\n# **Monday 2.12.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nbMLVYw.png))\n\n# **Monday 2.12.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2ftcd1t.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Tuesday 2.13.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4x7Uvuk.png))\n\n# **Tuesday 2.13.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/B91b7Dt.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PlZ55HD.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Wednesday 2.14.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tSnqot7.png))\n\n# **Wednesday 2.14.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FQjDZSp.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8v1UHfg.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Thursday 2.15.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6NdDWew.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/f3p5gb2.png))\n\n# **Thursday 2.15.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hbst5Ru.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/LmB1cOd.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 2.16.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/a4Ahsir.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 2.16.18 After Market Close:**\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Applied Materials, Inc. $48.08 \n&gt; **Applied Materials, Inc.
