Since then a director resigned over the company\u2019s handling of the bid as he felt the offer should have been made public and brought to shareholders. \n\nHydrovac is a misunderstood and underestimated business model with badger being the largest manufacturer and franchiser of hydrovac in North America. \n\nWith the strong earnings and growth potential, i still think even at 36$ cad the shares are underpriced. \n\nHowever the real impetus now is the short position. In my opinion, a short squeeze could be epic on this stock sending shares to 40-45$ easily. \n\nYear end earnings are being reported in mid March. \n\nGlta", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 315929, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Great short squeeze play Badger Daylighting ($bad.ca $badff)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ajewcu/great_short_squeeze_play_badger_daylighting_badca/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "okaw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_iq56x", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548361834, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ajgov9/pdf_of_klarman_letter_hurry/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ajgov9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/ajgov9/pdf_of_klarman_letter_hurry/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1548361835, "score": 1, "selftext": "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h2bc7kiwhumwvcp/AACgyqXPX3jw5ozQDQwbOhDia?dl=0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 315963, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PDF of Klarman letter.
