Unfortunately this wasn't enough, so we created a rule (see sidebar) against discussing crypto with a link to a sub where you could; we also made an automod rule to deal with this.\n\nIf you want to discuss investing in general, you can go to r/investing, which is mentioned in the sidebar (on mobile by tapping \"about this community\").

Please do your own DD as well and look at the technicals before buying.\n\n---\n\n**$ARRY** or Array Biopharma is a clinical stage immunooncology company founded in 1998. [They have a diverse pipeline](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/product-pipeline/) with 5 drugs in phase 3 of development. One of the first things I noticed about their pipeline was that they have a lot of partnerships with companies like Celgene, Roche, Loxe, ASLAN etc. They only have 2 drugs in the pipeline they fully own. But they have good deals in place that will give them milestone payments to keep the company afloat. I am bullish on $ARRY and I believe they have enormous potential and I\u2019ll list a few reasons why I think that.\n\n\n1. MASSIVE pipeline backed by big Pharma companies with excellent results.\n\n2. Upcoming PDUFA of Binimetinib - COLUMBUS a BRAF mutant melanoma cancer drug on June 30th (partnered with Pierre Fabre). [It is excellent tolerability and safety compared to its competitor vemurafinib](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/index.php/download_file/269/). No ADCOM is expected so expect to see this approved. Binimetinib - BEACON which is a combination of Binimetinib And Encorafenib for metastatic colorectal cancer results came out with its phase two results with solid results on [Saturday January 20th](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/download_file/282/). The overall response rate for 16 patients was 62% and there were three complete responses. This drug will move onto phase 3. Both products are in collaboration with Pierre Fabre who provided [$ARRY with 30 million upfront and will provide $425 million in additional milestones](http://investor.arraybiopharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=123810&amp;p=RssLanding&amp;cat=news&amp;id=2112588).\n\n3. Upcoming NDA with Danoprevir (partnered with Roche) a HepC drug. Its in phase 3 in China but an NDA submitted in China. Not much money here only $5 million, but money is money and it looks [promising](https://www.healio.com/hepatology/hepatitis-c/news/online/%7Bc2e5cdbe-2934-4612-b182-296a0dc87438%7D/asian-patients-achieve-svr-with-ravidasvir-ritonavir-danoprevir-ribavirin-combo)\n\n4. Phase 3 trial results in 2018 of Ipatasertib, a breast cancer drug, to be presented this year. It uses the AKT pathway so its novel and has a [better progression free survival](http://www.cancernetwork.com/asco-breast-cancer/ipatasertib-modestly-prolongs-pfs-triple-negative-breast-cancer) than placebo. Honestly, the response rate and everything is only slightly better than current drugs. But it is better.\n\n5. A decent amount of phase 2 and phase 1 drugs with triggers in 2018 like GDC-0575(partnered with Genentech with a potential [$380 million in milestone payments](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/product-pipeline/other-compounds/gdc-0575/)), ARRY-382 (PD-1 receptor drug) partnered with Merck\u2019s Keytruda (itself a $1 billion drug that is set to be approved this summer), ARRY-382 (breast cancer drug) which has shown [good initial data](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/index.php/download_file/218/) has two readouts this year and ARRY-797 which has shown [potential so far](http://www.arraybiopharma.com/index.php/download_file/245/)\n\n6. [They have money](http://investor.arraybiopharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=123810&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTExODYxNDkyJkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3#s1C70406362E652158BF41E557841219F). They ended the year with $235 million in cash. Their revenue did slow down and their debt increased slightly but that is due to their increase in R&amp;D. With a potential $600 million for milestone targets of Binimetinib and Encorafenib still in the works [alongside massive royalty sales for COLUMBUS](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/04269X/20170830/AR_334678.PDF), the future is secure for this company.\n\nNow the more iffy news: \n\n1. Not many triggers in 2018 (maybe a total of 6). The majority of the triggers will not cause the price to move a lot. The big exception being the PDUFA in June.\n\n2. Heavily shorted. Resistance at 13.20, 13.54 and 13.55. Support at 10.92.\n\n3. Waiting for news, there was news on January 20th upon good results on BEACON, but with the government shutdown, I don\u2019t know what will happen when market opens.\n\n4. Currently a one trick pony. Plenty of drugs in the pipeline, but they are all a few years away. Their future hinges on Binimetinib. I have no doubt it will be approved by the FDA, but there is a possibility that something like $ATRS happens where the company forgot something on the label and the stock tanked even though the drug itself is fine.\n\n---\n\nHowever, this is a good company. It has an impressive pipeline and money coming in from various partners. I\u2019d say this is a buy (especially anything around $12) and I think based on the triggers alone it might reach $20 by the end of the year. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "$ARRY- Array BioPharma - Due Diligence", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7rvylp/arry_array_biopharma_due_diligence/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "bilosellhi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516579384, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7s1pqx/thoughts_on_investing_in_brazil_stocks_or_etfs/", "id": "7s1pqx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7s1pqx/thoughts_on_investing_in_brazil_stocks_or_etfs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516641618, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 20, "selftext": "Brazil is just coming out of a recession.

Please do your own DD as well and look at the technicals before buying.\n\n---\n\n\nAntibe Therapeutics trades on the CVE as $ATE not on NASDAQ. It was founded in 2009 and produces anti-inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs have a huge market cap ($1.5B) also evidenced by the fact that these are easily obtainable drugs that most people know of like Advil and Aspirin. However most NSAIDs tend to cause either liver or gastric distress. Antibe\u2019s drugs standout by eliminating any gastric distress while performing as well as established NSAIDs. However after looking at the pros and cons, its too early to tell if this is going to be a multi-million dollar company or it will go bust. Therefore, for me it falls under the wait and see approach. Of course you could have a punt on it if you like to gamble because the potential increase at this price is remarkable.\n\nPros:\n\n1. ATB-346 (Naproxen alternative) with strong phase 2 results with showing pain relief double that of Naproxen but without any GI disturbances.\n2. ATB-346 safety and efficacy triggers in 1Q 2018 and 4Q 2018 with potential global partner deals in 2018.\nGood business model of creating medical devices and licensing them off to fund the drugs sector.\n3. ATB-352 (non addictive analgesic drug) showed good GI results in rats\n\nCons:\n\n1. Breaking into an already established field and competing with big hitters like Pfizer and Bayer.\n2. All drugs in early development and some while before they will reach the market. The money question will remain on their head in the meantime.\n3. Not enough scientific or clinical data yet so hard to tell if the drugs are any better than their competitors\n4. Medical devices in preclinical phase as well.\n\nUnfortunately, its very hard to do a medical based DD on a company that hasn\u2019t had any clinical results out. A majority of their drugs are in development with only ATB-346 the closest to the market but it is still in phase 2. Facts are their debt will continue to increase and their revenue will continue to decrease. Partnership and licensing deals will have to keep them afloat all the way into 2020 for them to be a viable company. \n\nAnd then there are the questions whether Antibe will be able to compete with the big boys of pharma once they do come out with a few drugs.

They have been looking really good for the long haul, it has the potential to go from 2.5b to 250b. in my opinion. Their financials are looking very positive. They are up y/y, they have no debt, they are making profit, they are sitting on a bunch of cash. Sales on amazon are up and prices are increasing due to demand. They are only breaking the surface on home robotics where only about 1% of consumers currently use a robot. Not to mention they havnt even released many products on the works. The owners are from MIT. I personally seen the business right near Boston. \nAll the big companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon will most likely integrate their Products as opposed to creating their own home robots. As these big companies go well over a trillion in the years coming 250b won\u2019t be too much for a big home robotics company.

That is when I thought maybe the stock will increase because its a great game and they will probably sell alot...\n\nI had no idea what I was doing so I just about about 30 shares at $16.50 or so. spent about $500.00 and the stock eventually went up to $32 and I sold it all... I was scared it would go back down...My reasoning for selling was that Microsoft was at $50 and there's no way a game company can be worth more than Microsoft shares... Now the stock is at $118.00...\n\nWhat did I do wrong? How would I know a game company can be worth more than Sony or Microsoft themselves?
