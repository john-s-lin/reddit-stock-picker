I've came across a few resources on this website that have helped me tremendously. My favorite being Earningswhispers.com. So I just thought I'd recommend an information source to anyone looking to generate some ideas. When you first access FinViz it shows you a very detailed Heat Map.. You can even change the parameters of the map to show things like % of volume/average traded..5 Year EPS growth, fP/E, and dividend yields. Very awesome way of looking at it.  Also you can type in a ticker, and get soooo much information right in one place.

So that even with the early withdrawal penalty, the taxes, and everything else, I still do far better investing inside an IRA even if I intend to spend the money in just a few years, and not wait until retirement. Put another way: short term gains are screwing my ROI so hard there is basically no reason to use a traditional account.\n\nAm I missing something? Is there a better way I should be doing this?

Today they had Chinese New Year and a fluffy dog. The bulls can tell you all the reasons the market will go up. 'Business is booming' they will say. 'The fundamentals are great. You'll be lucky to find another dip like this to buy in on.'\n\nThe bears keep quiet for the most part because it's like playing craps and betting the don't. Everybody hates you. \n\nBears and bulls come into conflict during different parts of the cycle. During a recovery, everybody is bullish. The bullish sentiment continues until the market is overbought or affected by external factors, and then some people turn bearish. On the way down, more people turn bearish. At the bottom of the cycle, there are a lot of bears, and they will turn bullish again during the next recovery.\n\nSo what is the advantage of being a bear early, like well before a market downturn? Nothing that you would notice right now. If you are sitting on cash, then nothing much is happening. It's pretty boring. \n\nThe advantage happens later. Eventually, there is a market downturn and bottom. By the end, the bulls have sunk every last dollar they have into a declining market, and they are out of money, depressed, and out of the game. That's when the bears swoop in and take control. The former bears, holding old cash, suddenly turn bullish and go on a shopping spree. They buy stocks at bargain-basement prices, and enjoy years of profitable returns. Meanwhile, the former bulls are licking their wounds and vowing to turn bearish earlier in the cycle next time.\n\nSo when is the right time to turn bearish? Consider the risks and benefits of placing a bet. Suppose a bet wins 1/10 times and pays 10:1. Would you take the bet? Sure, because you're a player, and that's what we do. \n\nWhat happens if the return is the same but the risk is much higher? Then you think about conserving your bankroll and waiting for a better bet.\n\nBears sitting on cash are taking (nearly) zero risk. The reward they will get when they return to the market is likely to be huge. Bears only have to be right once.\n\nBulls have to be right all the time forever.

I've been learning about trends and options trading and downloaded Thinkorswim to practice on the demo account and it has so much features that I'm kind of lost. Do you have any advice on how to start using ToS or where to find a good tutorial series?

I am not very smart but I figured out a way to make money online relatively easily. All I need is 10.000 $ and a trading account. \n\nI have been following some internet gurus like Sykes and others. I have lost some money trading forex. Now, after 3 years of studying I think I have a lot of knowledge but don't plan to stop and will continue studying.\n\nThe system to game the game is very easy. You just have to look on yahoo finance and look for stocks that are have risen for like 30 % and that have a lot of valitility and than you just buy and expect it to rise for example 20 - 100% before you get out, for security you just put the stop loss option.\n\nThe other way to do it is to listen to the \"scam artists\" that run pump and dump schemes and go in when they tell you to buy and be smarter and pull out after a small profit.\n\nI don't know. I have had relative success doing this lately. Maybe its just luck because of a bulish market or am.I that good?\n\nI don't understand a lot, but gurus like Sykes tell you that you just have to study and you will get rich..\n\nA friend told me that it is impossible to win the game like this, that the stock market is essentialy a chance game and a zero sum game, that if things were that easy, a savy teenager could make a bot that could outperform me easily and that if that were that easy evryone would do it.\n\nCan someone please tell me if this is viable strategy? I have quit my job to pursue a career in trading from home trough this system. If it doesnt work right away I plan to get a part time job and pour all my income into trading but at the same don't want to loose time and money just because I believe guys on youtube videos the tell me that it can be done.
