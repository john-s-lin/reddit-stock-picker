Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89.

However, small cap stocks, benefiting from \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February.

Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982.

That\u2019s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% \u2014 which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 \u2014 feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.\n\n&gt; Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn\u2019t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it\u2019s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.\n\n&gt; Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months.\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**\n\n&gt; If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&amp;P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days.
