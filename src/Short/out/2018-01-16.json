I believe this overvaluation is largely due to a shift in passively managed exchanged traded funds. \n\nBecause ETFs offer better tax benefits, lower fees and similar returns a lot of investors have moved their money from mutual funds into ETFs. Currently it is estimated that nearly 3 Trillion USD is invested in passive ETFs and nearly 30% of company stocks are held by an ETF. Many of these ETFs just follow an index like S&amp;P500. The problem with this shift to ETFs is that they just invest in all companies in that index regardless of whether that company does well. Because a rising tide lifts all boats and thus all stocks in some index like S&amp;P500 or other Russell 2000 have been doing well, which then attracts more money into these index tracking ETFs like a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n\nAnyway nothing wrong with ETFs but just curious if the upcoming market correction happens whether ETFs will accelerate this further since it is quite new financial instrument that hasn't really been tested in a bear market. Unlike mutual funds ETFs can be sold any time during business hours and unlike stocks they don't have the same liquidity and could quickly be pushed to zero when everyone starts selling. \n\nAny
