These are NOT penny stocks whose entire company is based on blockchain. If you are a visual learner, you can watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/jOBKNzp9i_k)\n\n\n1. Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)\n- \n- Broadridge provides investor communications and other solutions to the financial sector. They are one of the pioneers in this industry.\n* Broadridge is a standing out in the blockchain trend bc they\u2019ve already completing a successful pilot test of a blockchain-based technology in collaboration with two large European banks in October.\n* The company partnered with JPMorgan in 2016 to successfully test its technology with shareholder proxy voting to make it easier and more transparent. Considering BR was already the largest U.S. provider of proxy voting services, it made sense for it to step in here.\n2. MasterCard (MA)\n- \n* Mastercard announced that it is now opening up its blockchain to certain banks and merchants as an alternative and potentially more efficient method of paying for goods and services.\n* They are targeting cross-border payments between businesses as the primary purpose for its blockchain, which can only be used by invitation.\n* Mastercard\u2019s blockchain operates independently and instead accepts payments in traditional local money which is seen by some as a positive. \n3. Microsoft (MSFT)\n- \n* Microsoft is committed to bringing blockchain to the enterprise and they are working with customers, partners, and the blockchain community to continue advancing its enterprise readiness through it\u2019s COCO Framework\n* Coco will be compatible, by design, with any ledger protocol and can operate in the cloud and on premises\n* By design, Coco is open and compatible with any blockchain protocol. Microsoft has already begun integrating E\n* Microsoft\u2019s intent is to contribute the source code to the dev community in early 2018\n4. Visa (V)\n- \n* Visa has rolled out the first, pilot phase of its blockchain-based business-to-business payments service, B2B Connect.\n* Similar to MasterCard, Visa plans to use the platform to ease cross-border payments by facilitating direct payments between institutions, cutting out the middleman the industry currently relies on.\n* Visa's global head of solutions, Kevin Phalen, said that the banks are trialing live bank-to-bank transactions over the platform. Following this first phase of the project, phase two will see the project move to a commercial launch, slated to occur in the middle of 2018\n5. Cisco Systems (CSCO)\n- \n* Cisco is one of the 200 organizations that are a part of the Enterprise E Alliance. These are governments and companies from all over the world, and multiple industries, testing out a version of E's blockchain\n* Cisco is also working to craft its own blockchain systems. In October, the company filed for the trademark of a blockchain platform that can identify different connected devices, monitor the activity of those devices, and evaluate how trustworthy those devices are when connected to a network. \n* It would also continually and automatically assess new devices when added to the network. In other words, Cisco believes it has a game-changing blockchain to track the Internet of Things.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Big Companies Using Blockchain in 2018", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7on2kz/big_companies_using_blockchain_in_2018/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "rico_chavez", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1515262702, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7okuul/biotech_stocks/", "id": "7okuul", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "locked": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7okuul/biotech_stocks/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1515329597, "score": 11, "selftext": "Been looking recently at some of these younger biotech companies, lots of new bills and laws passing for new types of drugs that these companies can create.
