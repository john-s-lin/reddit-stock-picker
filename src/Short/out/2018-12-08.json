Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&amp;P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&amp;P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.\n*****\n&gt; As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points \u2014 a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.\n*****\n&gt; There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we\u2019re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&amp;P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it\u2019s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a \u201cdeath cross,\u201d a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe real question is are we headed for a global recession. That\u2019s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cEveryone keeps saying they\u2019re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&amp;P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re heading for a recession. I\u2019m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&amp;P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,\u201d Stovall said. The S&amp;P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It\u2019s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn\u2019t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&amp;P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that\u2019s the kind of decline we could get.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday\u2019s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,\u201d said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.\n*****\n&gt; Redler said he expects the S&amp;P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. \u201cWe\u2019re due for a bounce,\u201d he said. \u201cRisk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it\u2019s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there\u2019s a ceiling out there.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we\u2019re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve \u2014 or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.\n*****\n&gt; *[(Click Here for the Source!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aq6keMV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/rYGpdNQ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/40CrNit.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MYhOcQT.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9u9CpVX.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ymik4eV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FxeozB6.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/thuEMxW.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ip088zM.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GzqIKE1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/StUNlsv.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves Near Inversion\n\n&gt; On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.\n\n&gt; In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve\u2019s movement leading up to the last recession.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**\n\n&gt; Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**\n\n&gt; Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**\n\n&gt; Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal\u2014albeit very flat\u2014curve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-10s30s.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Time for Santa?\n\n&gt; 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. \u201cAlthough the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can\u2019t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!\n\n&gt; Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That\u2019s right\u2014since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/december-has-never-been-the-worst-month.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between\n\n&gt; Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&amp;P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today\u2019s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.\n\n&gt; These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b982d015890c90e57b0442812306651/tumblr_inline_pj8djzfkAa1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for December 10th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.9.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$DSW** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$PVTL** \n&gt; * **$ASNA** \n&gt; * **$INSE** \n&gt; * **$FRAN** \n&gt; * **$GTIM** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$ASPU** \n&gt; * **$ARWR** \n&gt; * **$DLHC** \n&gt; * **$CASY** \n&gt; * **$PLAB** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$NCS**\n&gt; * **$NX** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$SEAC** \n&gt; * **$ROAD** \n&gt; * **$CHKE** \n&gt; * **$IRET** \n&gt; * **$OXM** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$FTI** \n&gt; * **$VERU** \n&gt; * **$PHX** \n&gt; * **$CIVI** \n&gt; * **$SKIS** \n&gt; * **$SMMT** \n&gt; * **$PURE** \n&gt; * **$STRM** \n&gt; * **$MMMB** \n&gt; * **$AXNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jh0ejTe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpDB5mo.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.10.18 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldSOx5q.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.10.18 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PCBvre3.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eUvhnqI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.11.18 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTE5GSI.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WNrc9L0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.12.18 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/e11Vsbq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.13.18 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0blzTgU.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.13.18 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Hqam8yz.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.14.18 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.14.18 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Adobe Systems, Inc. $238.00 \n&gt; **Adobe Systems, Inc.

They are trading for just over 8 bucks right now and I'm not exactly sure what returning to profitability will mean for the stock price, but you have to think that it could at the very least get in to the teens. The majority of the world's oil still comes from off shore and somehow they managed to survive that brutal contraction due to shale boom  that put a lot of off shore guys out of business. What do you guys this of this as a spec play. Definitely set a stop loss and be patient but it could be a pretty nice investment if things play out. Transocean was once a behemoth in the industry and if they can just get up and running again you should see very good return.
