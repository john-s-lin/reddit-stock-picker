Tuesday was another difficult trading day on Wall Street with energy shares falling on lower oil prices and retailers struggling after weak earnings and fears about slowing global economic growth. The Nasdaq closed at a seven-month low on Tuesday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 saw their weakest trading day since October.\n\nAsian markets were pressured on Wednesday by continuing trade fears after Washington criticized Beijing on Tuesday for failing to change its \u201cunfair, unreasonable\u201d trade policies. The condemnation of Beijing came from an investigation into China\u2019s intellectual property and technology transfer policies which was a precursor to a meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders at the end of this month. Most analysts are pessimistic about the potential for a deal to be reached at the upcoming meeting.\n\nAs of 2:02 p.m. HK/SIN all major Asian indexes were trading lower, with the exception of the Shenzhen Composite which was up 0.16 percent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 was down 0.22 percent, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index was down 0.04 percent and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 was 0.51 percent lower. South Korea\u2019s Kospi was also down 0.29 percent. The sea of red followed another brutal day of losses on Wall Street on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 closing down 1.82 percent, the Nasdaq 1.70 percent lower and the Dow closing down 2.21 percent. These losses followed a day of significant losses on Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore on: [https://www.groundstoneholdings.com/2018/11/21/morning-technical-newsletter-39/](https://www.groundstoneholdings.com/2018/11/21/morning-technical-newsletter-39/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 295837, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Morning Technical Newsletter-Global Stock Selloff Continues Amid Trader Fears", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9z4s0e/morning_technical_newsletterglobal_stock_selloff/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "RichTVLive", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11lh46", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542832177, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9z7076/canntrust_reports_record_revenue_for_q3_2018/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9z7076", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9z7076/canntrust_reports_record_revenue_for_q3_2018/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542832178, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 295884, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "CannTrust\u2122 Reports Record Revenue for Q3 2018 - Taking Steps to List on ...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9z7076/canntrust_reports_record_revenue_for_q3_2018/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "The_Highlife", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_alwbh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542836838, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9z7px5/restructuring_my_roth_ira_schwab_investments/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9z7px5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9z7px5/restructuring_my_roth_ira_schwab_investments/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542836839, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9yz4ox/top_fidelity_mutual_fundsetfs_for_roth_ira/) recent /r/stocks post so I thought I would try as well. I'm in a slightly different position than the OP of that post so I feel it warrants a separate post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me start by saying that I don't know anything about trading. I don't know what people mean by \"long\" or \"short\", i don't know the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF - I only know that they're different from stocks by virtue of the fact that their a *collection* of stocks...I think. I don't know why some markets are better than others for different situations. I don't know what \"bull\" or \"bear\" means. And every time I try to look this stuff up, it just glosses over me. Nothing sticks. It never has. So now I'm in the position where I need to *have been thinking* about my retirement and don't know what to do with the money I have socked away, so I'd really love some insight from this community!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had a Schwab Roth IRA for about 10 years now, and I've made (max) deposits into the account on and off for a total of about 7 times. Over that time I've been following their recommended portfolio allocation for an \"aggressive\" stance, more or less. I just made a max deposit for the year, and with all the news up in arms about losing everything that was gained in 2018, and with the possibility of another recession on the horizon, I'd like to make a smart decision about what to do with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm definitely a \"hands-off\" type. I'm not going to try to play the market, but I don't want to throw money at things I don't understand. Currently, my portfolio is allocated as such:\n\n* About 50% of my account is in Large Cap Equity (I don't know what this means but that's what they recommend), Funds including NASDX, SCHB, SHX, and VT.\n* About 20% is in Small Cap Equity (again, I don't  know what this means but that's what they recommend), Funds including RZG, SCHA, VT\n* About 15% is in international (Target says 25%. Should I listen?), Funds include SCHE, SCHF, VT, and VXUS.\n* And the rest is in cash (18% vs. recommended target of 5%).\n\nI've been told I have diversified too much (what does that mean?) and should cut back on how many ETFs I have invested in. I don't know if this is good or bad, or where I should be investing. Should I put any money in individual stocks? Should I stick with ETF's and MF's? Should I hold on to the cash or put it somewhere? Please help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I have money in a Roth IRA and more cash ready to be invested but I don't know WTF to do and I'm ~~looking~~ begging for some outside advice.", "send_replies":
