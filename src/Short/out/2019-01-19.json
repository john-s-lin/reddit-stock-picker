Happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty good last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 21st, 2019.\n\n# **Stocks getting a bit frothy after move higher, could pause as more earnings roll out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/stocks-getting-a-bit-frothy-after-move-higher-could-pause-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have gotten a boost from optimismfor U.S.-China trade talks, but earnings could take a bigger role in the week ahead, when reports roll in from a diverse group of companies in tech, railroads, pharma, airlines and consumer products.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks closed higher for a fourth week, amid talk the market may be getting overbought. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.9 percent for the week, to 2,670, giving it a gain of 13.6 percent from the Dec. 24 closing low. Going into the week, strategists were wondering if the S&amp;P could even hold above the 2,600 level, a key area of resistance, but it punched through the level, ending the week above the band of resistance.\n*****\n&gt; \"I think the market had made even the pros frustrated. At this point, if you haven't bought the market this year, it's not the most prudent thing to do to chase it today. At the same time, being short is frustrating,\" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.\n*****\n&gt; Redler said he's still long the market, but is hedging because the quick gains have made it riskier. \"The next stop traders are looking at is 2,700 to 2,730 ... next week could be a good week for a pause while [the market] digests the move.\" Redler said next week's reports will be important, but the following week will be key with Apple and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; Headlines on trade were a positive this past week, including one that the U.S. was considering rolling back tariffs and another that China was offering to ramp up U.S. imports.\n*****\n&gt; \"We are going to continue to see these headlines until the deadline,\" said Cesar Rojas, Citigroup global economist. Rojas said he expects to see a deal between the U.S. and China by the March 1 deadline, and while all the details may not be ironed out, he does not expect to see more tariffs.\n*****\n&gt; \"The focus for China is to stabilize its economy. One of the reasons we see a window of opportunity for a trade deal is the growth dynamics for the U.S. and China. We see still growth in the U.S., weakening growth in China for the first half, but for the second half, we see stabilizing growth in China and moderating growth in the U.S.,\" he said. He said the next senior-level talks at the end of the month could be key.\n*****\n&gt; \"I think you want to watch trade. We have a client survey we do once a quarter, and more than half the investors thought we would not get a trade deal by March 1,\" said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equities strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \"I think that's part of the reason the market's been acting better in here. It's not that anything has happened, but you have some nice news, news that's moving in a positive direction.\"\n*****\n&gt; Economic reports in the week ahead will be limited due to the government shutdown, which in itself is a growing risk for markets as economists say it could shave a tenth of a percentage point off GDP growth for each week it continues. Regularly scheduled durable goods will not be available, but there will be existing home sales Tuesday and jobless claims on Thursday, among others.\n*****\n&gt; For the stock market, earnings will be important, with nearly 60 S&amp;P companies reporting. That includes IBM and Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday; Procter and Gamble and United Technologies Wednesday, and Intel and Starbucks Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Financial companies were a mixed bag in the past week, with some high-profile misses such as Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, with its first miss in 15 quarters.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings growth at this point is expected to be up 14.2 percent, when considering companies that have already reported, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; \"You have to be a little careful at this point. It's very lumpy when you're coming out of the gate sector-by-sector,\" said Calvasina. \"I think the industrials are going to be an important sector. I'm curious to see what's going to happen to them. The margin expectations have been pretty high, and a lot of the sell-side expectations are baking in expansion.\" Calvasina said the sector was one of the most vocal last quarter about the impact of tariffs and could have updates on the impact.\n*****\n&gt; For tech, earnings expectations have been coming down and are now at 2.6 percent growth for the sector in 2019. The lowered expectations for technology companies have trailed the declines in other sectors, such as materials, consumer discretionary and health care, Calvasina said. Overall, the S&amp;P is expected to see earnings growth of 6 percent in 2019, down from more than 23 percent in 2018.\n*****\n&gt; Even with lowered earnings expectations, technology stocks are not really reflecting the earnings cuts as much as some other sectors. Semiconductors has been a culprit, pulling down the whole group. On a price-to-earnings basis, relative to the market, technology P/Es have been creeping higher, not falling, she said.\n*****\n&gt; \"The damage to earnings is worse than the damage to the price,\" she said, meaning that the stocks could be vulnerable this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; The World Economic Forum begins in Davos, Switzerland, on Sunday. President Donald Trump and Cabinet members are not attending because of the government shutdown.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wCm025H.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Hb1FeIH.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HKEsZHI.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/3E4tKmo.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/I2mgrW6.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WM5JbyP.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2v3rxrY.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WTWMIZ4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cXBwa1I.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mQtZZln.png))**\n(PENDING THE STATUS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN!)\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eOcSkrU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Z2M4v2O.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks So Far in 2019\n\n&gt; Below we take a look at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since we turned the corner into the new year. The top stock in the S&amp;P 500 so far YTD is the healthcare play Celgene (CELG). At today\u2019s close, the company finished up an astounding 37.67% year to date. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Netflix (NFLX) are not far behind up 35.44% and 32.5%, respectively.\n\n&gt; While Health Care and Communication Services stocks make up the top three, the Energy sector is actually the most represented on the list with 11 out of 30 names. Whereas Tech was the poster child for gains for most of last year, there is only a single Technology stock in the top 30, and it\u2019s probably the last one you\u2019d guess \u2014 Xerox (XRX).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/best1.png))**\n\n&gt; Taking a look at the other end of the spectrum, with bankruptcy talks dominating the focus of the stock, PG&amp;E (PCG) has fallen 70.91% in just 15 days. Macy\u2019s ranks 2nd with a decline of 16.12%, while Newmont Mining (NEM) ranks 3rd at -10.48%. These are the only three stocks in the index down more than 10% on the year.\n\n&gt; The worst performers have a much larger variation on a sector basis. Health Care, which was another outperformer of 2018, is the only standout with 8 companies represented in the worst 30. The only sectors without a stock making this list are Real Estate, Communication Services, and Energy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/worst1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical Pre-Election Year January Trading: Up, Up &amp; Away\n\n&gt; In pre-election years, Januarys have been downright stellar ranking #1 for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA since 1950. Thus far, this January has been adhering to this historical tendency rather well. As of yesterday\u2019s close, Russell 2000 was leading the charge, up nearly 7.2%. NASDAQ was in second place with a gain of 5.9% while DJIA was at the back of the pack at 3.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at the chart below, comparing past historical average pre-election year January performance with 2019 as of the close on the eleventh trading day (January 15), you can see all five indexes are have produced above average gains throughout most of the month already. You can also see that, on average, the trend from now until the end of the month has been quite positive which suggests further gains are possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/92619ab897507e8ab5c467b819c2131f/tumblr_inline_plfy0uAvsu1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# High Yield Spreads: When Crashing is a Good Thing\n\n&gt; After screaming higher towards the end of 2018 right up through the first couple of days of 2019, high yield spreads have come crashing back down to earth in the last two weeks, falling from a high of 544 basis points (bps) on 1/3 to 440 bps through Thursday. At their highs two weeks ago, spreads were the widest they have been since the Summer of 2016 and the highest while moving higher since the middle of 2015 when oil prices were crashing.\n\n&gt; In the lower chart, we show the 10-day rate of change of high yield spreads over time. At their peak back on 1/3, spreads had seen the largest 10-day move wider since early 2018 (98 bps). Ten trading days later, we are now looking at the largest narrowing move in spreads since July 2016. Unlike the current period, the narrowing of spreads in July 2016 did not immediately follow a 10-day move where spreads widened significantly. To find a period where this large of a move immediately followed a ten-day period where investors couldn\u2019t exit high yield fast enough (wider spreads), you have to go back to that period in February 2016 that was marked by the \u2018Dimon Bottom.\u201d Now, if only the market follows a similar path moving forward!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/011819-High-Yield.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for January 18th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.20.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading month ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$STLD** \n&gt; * **$ATI** \n&gt; * **$SWK** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$FITB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$CMCSA** \n&gt; * **$UBSH**\n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$KMB** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$URI** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$WDC** \n&gt; * **$GATX** \n&gt; * **$FBC** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$PEBO** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$FNB** \n&gt; * **$OFG** \n&gt; * **$UBS** \n&gt; * **$MKC** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$UNP**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cXBwa1I.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0l0sQbd.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.21.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

They also have a functionality on their website which allows people to search a specific ticker and find out how many shares are available to short, which I find convenient.\n\nI am currently using the TOS platform to papertrade but I plan to start investing hopefully by next month. I find myself wanting to short a lot more than I currently do but TOS (paper trading) seems to have a very limited amount of shares available to short. On top of that, their $6.95 / trade (for both open and close) is kind of high and eats away at profits.\n\nSo if anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.
