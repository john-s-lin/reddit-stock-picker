A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.   Active companies in the Cannabis markets this week include Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC:NUGS),  Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG), Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH).\n\nCannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty\u2019s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.\n\n\u201cThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,\u201d commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.\n\nThe True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.\n\nThe agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.\n\nYu added, \u201cWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.\u201d\n\nThe infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a \u201chigh\u201d feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Based on our growth rates, we now believe our $30 million revenue guidance for next year is very conservative.  We welcome SeeThruEquity\u2019s research coverage and look forward to supplying its analyst a steady stream of news on high quality developments regarding our progress.\n\nPyramidion Technology Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TLRY), a global leader in cannabis research, production and distribution, announced this week that Tilray 2:100, a product produced at Tilray\u2019s federally licensed, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-certified facility in Canada, was successfully imported into the United Kingdom, to supply a pediatric patient in need.

However, in July 2018, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced that clinicians will now legally be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicines to patients with an exceptional clinical need noting \u201crecent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.\u201d\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. The Company, along with its U.S. subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences, announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EPIDIOLEX\u00ae (cannabidiol) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age or older. EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant. Most patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved AEDs.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  FN Media Group LLC. owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com (FNM) and MarketNewsUpdates.com (MNU) is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

(OTC: PYTG) Bolsters Advisory Board by Appointing Dr. Michael McKenzie\n\nWESTON, Florida, September 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nPyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC: PYTG) today announces that Dr. Michael McKenzie is the most recent addition to the company's Board of Advisors.\n\nDr. Michael McKenzie, MD specializes in family medicine and approaches healthcare with the individual person in mind. In reference to his medical practice, Dr. McKenzie states \"I view each patient as a unique opportunity to consult, care for, and address their individual health-care needs. At times, this involves a holistic approach to healthcare and leads to non-prescription drug choices. I view cannabis, in many forms, such as CBD in oil [Cannabidiol] and in other delivery methods, as recently chartered waters with a myriad of potential benefits.\"\n\nDr. McKenzie's contributions to the dialogues taking place amongst the medical professionals serving on the Advisory Board for PYTG are expected to steer the course of product planning towards individually-catered formulas and addressing the needs of particular case types. Given Dr. McKenzie's focus on the individual patient and the time he dedicates to his patients along with his understanding of the human body and mind, the Advisory Board is excited to explore his input and feedback on product designs, formulas, and delivery methods.\n\nCEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, explains that, \"We are seeking to bolster our already strong Advisory Board with physicians that sincerely care for their patients and who are looking out for their patients' best interests. Dr. McKenzie does exactly that - he approaches family care in an organic, ground-up manner, with a constant focus on the patients themselves. During our interactions with Dr. McKenzie, his dedication to his patients and his diligence for providing top-quality medical care is clearly of the highest priority.\"\n\nWhen asked \"What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?\", Dr. McKenzie responded, \"We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.\"\n\nResearch investigating the effects of CBD have produced positive findings thereby supporting its use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy.\n\nDr. McKenzie continues, \"I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and my experience treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.\"\n\nThe Advisory Board for PYTG is now tasked with product line formula creation, review, polishing, and perfecting as well as seeking potentially new and innovative delivery methods including restorative sports drinks, lotions, flavored oils, sweets and candies, cookies, along with many others. Dr. McKenzie's expertise in family medicine and the patient as an individual should provide PYTG with a unique perspective related to product refining and development.\n\n\"Dr. McKenzie is exactly what we have been looking for and we are excited to bring him on board. He is someone who cares as much as we do and we trust he will make valuable contributions to the Advisory Board and the products,\" explains Carlos Hurtado, CEO of PYTG.\n\nAbout Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc   \n\nPyramidion Technology Group, Inc.

In the first half of 2018 they collected  AU$35 million in commission for the full-year. This means their market cap/commission ratio is around 5. \n* Upwork is doing US$1.5 billion annualized gross services volume run-rate.UpWork's commission is currently somewhere around 13 percent. This means that UpWork's 2018 commission should be around US$200 million.\n* If they get the same commission multiple as publicly traded Freelancer.com, then that would value **UpWork at around US$1 billion** (5 x US$200 million).\n\n There are some other properties of UpWork that make it more attractive than Freelancer such as:\n\n* Being the most likely market leader\n* US location/listing\n* Much stronger platform tech which means they may be able to defend their 2014 valuation multiple of 9.5 times which would **value UpWork at US$1.9 billion**.\n\n**A price in the US$1-1.9 billion range seems likely.

This stock as near it's 52 week high, so if you are not a long buyer, be weary of a pullback. Please do your own DD. \n\nJust wanted to present some information about a stock that i've been following for a few weeks now. It's still pretty under the radar with low volume. \n\nSSTI is a company that produces detectors that detect gun fire and informs police of the location through triangulation in as little as 30 seconds. Apparently, this is useful, because in areas of high gun violence, people tend to become desensitized to it and police often don't get called. \n\nThe first question I had was, how can this tech discriminate between a gun shot and something similar sounding, like a firework. So, I learned that the captured sounds are routed to their headquarters where they have an experienced team that listens to the sounds and helps distinguish between a gun shot and other similar sounding sounds.\n\nSo, they are able to detect the gun shots, does this actually make a difference? I found a lot of firsthand anecdotal evidence from people that lived in cities that have this tech present. Some people said it worked and police were able to get evidence much more quickly, while others said police showed up, and even though it happened quickly, it still didn't make a difference as they couldn't find shell casings and the perpetrators had already fled. However, recently, the city of Chicago renewed shotspotter to a 3 year/23 million dollar contract, and stated that it helped lower gun violence by a 43% total. The Chicago police superintendent even said that this technology was the biggest fact in reducing gun violence and that it was a game changer. This figure still seems unbelievable to me, but honestly it doesn't even matter. The fact of the matter is is that gun violence is not gonna decrease anytime soon. They are never going to institute any gun control measures. But, as these events become more and more publicized, governments and police forces are going to need to look like they're trying to combat the problem, and this is the exact type of tech they're going to spend money on to at least make it seem like they care. The contract extension does give me belief that the product is legit though. \n\nWith this in mind, there is a lot of room for expansion. They are in about 90ish cities right now with plans to expand to 140+ in the coming year. So how are they expanding? Previously, they had a partnership with Verizon to be packaged in security suite of products that Verizon would advertise through their brand. Recently, Verizon decided to allow Shotspotter to be sold as a stand alone product. Why does this matter? Previously, if people didn't want to buy the entire suite, they didn't have the option to buy shotspotter alone, but now they can and that should increase sales. There can also be expansion that occurs within the cities they are already located in. For example, after initial testing, Chicago decided to expand Shotspotter into a bigger area, which obviously means more revenue for SSTI. \n\nSo, there is a lot of room for growth imo. In terms of financials, the stock is near its 52 week high. I hesitated to post this now, because I know people tend to see hype on a stock and then jump in, but there is a possibility this could see a short term pullback, so please do your own DD. If you are long though, I think any time is a good time to get in. The market cap is only at 650Million, and if we extrapolate the chicago contract out to other cities, it becomes obvious that there is a lot of room for growth. The company increased 52% in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and they were on the cusp of being profitable. Again, please do your own DD and feel free to as any questions\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/chicago-signs-23-million-multi-year-agreement-with-shotspotter-to-extend-gunshot-detection-coverage-into-next-decade/\n\nhttps://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/shotspotter-expands-verizon-partnership-with-reseller-agreement-for-gunshot-detection-services/\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 270495, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Shotspotter ($SSTI) DD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9fm9qj/shotspotter_ssti_dd/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "JCvalentyne", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_im6fj", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536864385, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9fkol1/facebook/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9fkol1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 38, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9fkol1/facebook/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1536864386, "score": 10, "selftext": "FB now has a P/E of 20 so in my opinion, it's already priced as a slightly higher value stock (value stock for me is around 15 p/e) and no where near priced as a growth stock.
