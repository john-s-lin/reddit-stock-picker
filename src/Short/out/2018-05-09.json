Thought I might as well share the research behind my investments. Here is the first one, if people like it I can do a write up on my other investments:\n\nAchaogen\u2019s stock has been unfairly punished following the recommendations offered by the FDA advisory committee. If anything, investors should be assured about the almost guaranteed FDA approval of Plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).\n\n10% \u2013That\u2019s the estimated percent of women with a urinary tract infection in any given year. More conservatively, the number of cases per year is estimated at 150 million, putting it ahead of world-wide cancer cases by a factor of 10 (~14 million), and on par with the flu. Often these are simple to treat, but in the case where the infection involves the upper urinary tract, is recurrent, occurs in men, or in a patient with diabetes or who is otherwise immuno-compromised, the infection becomes a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). This is the pool of patients that Achaogen is seeking to treat with its soon-to-be-approved candidate, Plazomicin.\n\nPathology aside, the cUTI market is too widespread for an accurate assessment of the number of patients. The number of generics already in the market, such as meropenem, also makes an estimate for peak sales difficult. Perhaps the best comparable is the acquisition of The Medicine Company\u2019s cUTI portfolio by Melinta Therapeutics for $270 million in upfront payments and up to 25% in royalties on world-wide sales. An analyst has predicted peak sales for Vabomere, a cUTI treatment from The MedCo\u2019s basket, at $350 million in 2027. This brings forth two important considerations: Vabomere is a combination of meropenem and another drug that prevent bacteria from degrading meropenem. The second consideration is that Plazomicin was tested against meropenem and demonstrated clear superiority. Thus it is likely that this therapy will take a backseat to Plazomicin.\n\nTwo phase 3 trials were performed to evaluate the efficacy of Achaogen\u2019s Plazomicin compared to the current gold-standard treatment. The Phase 3 EPIC trial conformed to the FDA\u2019s guidelines on developing drugs for cUTI, and demonstrated statistical superiority to meropenem. The minimum requirement for a drug approval in this space is proof of non-inferiority. Hence the determination of superiority guarantees FDA approval of Plazomicin, despite a slight uptick in the number of treatment related adverse events.\n\nThe second Achaogen trial, CARE, was conducted to evaluate plazomicin for bloodstream infections using a non-conventional trial format. This trial also demonstrated improved survival, but the low sample size led to an 11-4 recommendation against plazomicin for BSI. Fortunately for value investors, the loss of the BSI indication is not worth the 28% drop seen in the stock following the AdCom results.\n\nFurthermore, a rejection of Plazomicin for BSI treatment is not assured, the AdCom provides only voluntary guidance. The bloodstream approval would be evaluated under a novel FDA program, and the beneficial safety profile of Plazomicin gives the FDA an incentive to approve Plazomicin, if not for any other reason than the fact that few options exist for treating patients with carbapenem-resistant bloodstream infections. Of course, one potential outcome is that the FDA asks for additional data post-approval, draining Achaogen of important financial resources.\n\nFinally, what do the financials at Achaogen look like? The market cap of $500 million doesn\u2019t make AKAO a screaming buy. With only a single approval for Plazomicin, it will have to perform extremely well post-launch, likely requiring a resource-intensive marketing campaign. While there are other candidates in the Acahogen pipeline, these are exceptionally far from approval. Negatives aside, with an almost guaranteed approval of Plazomicin by June 25, investors can expect an almost certain bump in the stock price. Perhaps even a doubling in the next 6 months. With cash equivalents of $144 million and an available credit facility, dilution shouldn\u2019t happen for the remainder of 2018.\n\nShort-term, AKAO looks like a great investment, if for nothing then to capitalize on the hype from an FDA approval for cUTI, and perhaps a bonus approval for BSI. Long-term, the potential looks much less certain, but with considerable upside possible.\n\nAs always, investors should perform their own research and risk assessment before purchasing stocks, and I don't assume any responsibility for losses incurred.\n\nDisclosure: I am long AKAO since 5/4/18\nAlso, the autobot didn't like my links to sources.

This was because I kept buy back shares of companies I took a loss in within 30 days. My profits were around $14,000 but I had to pay about $20,000 worth of taxes. Not too bad, but avoidable.\n\nOne question I have that I wasn\u2019t able to find out through the PDF is how averaging down effects your wash sale.\n\nLets say I bought 1 contract of RTN for $169 (strike and expiry don\u2019t matter in this case). Over the course of a few weeks I continued to average down to the point 5 contracts had the average price of $60.

T\\-bills are largely considered a low\\-risk investment option. When yields approach 3&amp;#37;, the rate of risk\\-free return in the marketplace increases for investors.\n\nThis means that some market participants could be convinced to leave the market in favour of safer returns.\n\n*Debt To GDP*An overall metric for the amount of debt in an economy. This figalonelong might not help much \\- it functions best when paired with other metrics.\n\nFor example, a rapid acceleration in debt in high debt to gdp countries can foreshadow the bursting of a credit bubble, provided the debt is high enough.\n\nValue Investing Metrics\n\n**Value Investing**\n\n*PE Ratio*PE ratio shows a company\u2019s price relative to its earnings.\n\ne.g. A company earning $100m per annum with a market cap of $1bn. would have a pe ratio of 10.\n\nPE ratio is a good measure of value for a business generating considerable free cash flow in non\\-changing industries.\n\nInvestors should be careful though because the valuation metric can sometimes be misleading. For example, if a company\u2019s earnings are expected to drop, the pe ratio fo the stock might fall because the market is forecasting the drop. The stock might seem cheap, but it\u2019s pe ratio will jump from really low to really high when earnings are released.\n\n*ROIC \\- Return On Invested Capital*ROIC is the return on an investor\u2019s capital over a particular time horizon. A high ROIC normally indicates that a company has a high quality brand.\n\nIf you invest 1,000 in a business and your investment generates $1,100 in a year, the ROIC is 10&amp;#37;.\n\nROIC is similar to return on equity, except it measures the return on equity and debt. Return on equity just measures equity.\n\n*Current Ratio*Current ratio tells investors how well a company can pay back its short\\-term liabilities and short\\-term assets. If the current ratio is over 1.0, the firm has more short\\-term assets than liabilities. If the ratio is less than 1, the opposite is normally true \\- the company could be vulnerable to shocks in the economy.\n\n*Discounted Free Cash Flow*This is the metric favoured by most value investors. The discounted free cash flow model gets investors to future earnings over the next 5\\-10 years.\n\nIt is important to select companies with relatively predictable future cash flows and positive cash flows. Most small companies will not meet this requirement, because they usually have larger capital expenditures.There are three components to the DCF model\n\n*Free Cash Flow*The amount of cash a business is generating and can distribute to the share holders.\n\nTerminal value \\- value of the money at the end of the investing horizon\n\nThe DCF gets users to calculate the total cash flow from an investing horizon. This model is then compared to return on treasury bills \\(considered almost risk\\-free return\\).\n\nIf you think a stock is worth $20 based on a DCF model and the current price is $10. It is under\\-valued.\n\nA:Present value \\(PV\\) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flow given a specified rate of return. Meanwhile, net present value \\(NPV\\) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time.\n\n*Piotroski F Score*The P F score is named after Professor Joseph Piotroski who devised the investment thesis while at theUniversity of Chicago. Piotrovski identified that value investors were attrcated to companies under temporary stress. Most times investors put capital in businesses that turned around, but sometimes businesses never picked up again and petered out.\n\nThe scale is designed to weed out the companies which have a better chance at long\\-term survival and the companies will fail.\n\nThe scale is from 1\\-9. 9 Represents the best companies. You can read more here\n\n\\([http://www.midf.com.my/images/Downloads/Research/EqStrategy/Earnings/Strategy\\-Quant\\-Piotroski\\-F\\-Score\\-MIDF\\-131017.pdf](http://www.midf.com.my/images/Downloads/Research/EqStrategy/Earnings/Strategy-Quant-Piotroski-F-Score-MIDF-131017.pdf)\\)\n\nThe P\\-formua was the only stock picking strategy which yielded positive absolute returns in 2008.\n\n*Price To Book Value*The value of a firm\u2019s assets minus its liabilities is the book value of a stock. Value investors can guarantee a margin of safety when they invest in a company trading below book value.\n\nThis means that the entire business were to stop suddenly generating cash, the assets on the balance could still be paid off to return money to shareholders.\n\nValue investors will usually calculate the book value of a stock themselves without relying on screeners. Companies have intangible assets which are not counted on the stock\u2019s balance sheet like human capital, or franchise value.\n\nA stricter version of book value is breakup value. This is the value of the assets if the company were to break up.\n\n*Dividend Growth History*The growth of a company\u2019s dividend is important for long\\-term dividend growth investors.\n\nDividend payouts illustrate a company\u2019s attitude to shareholders. The longer a company has increased their dividends, the more shareholder friendly they become.\n\nCoca cola for example has increased its dividend every year for the past thirty years and probably long before that as well.\n\n*FCF To Debt*Indicates whether a company can cover its own debt expenses. A higher number means there is more FCF from operations to cover debt and interest expenses.\n\n*EV/EBITDA*PE ratios can sometimes disguise the true nature of a business\u2019 health. The energy sector for example is a cyclical business in which earnings fluctuates.\n\nGenerally speaking, the metric means you are spending less money for $1 earnings. Be careful not to get caught in value traps, because there are exceptions:\n\n1. A high growth company might have very low current earnings but huge upside and therefore will trade at a higher multiple.\n2. Some companies are riskier \\(however you want to define risk\\) and thus warrant a lower multiple.\n3. Some companies are cyclical and thus the current multiple is skewed by where the market thinks we are in an economic cycle.\n4. There\u2019s important line items underneath EBITDA such as reinvestment needs \\(WC needs, Capex, R&amp;D etc\\). This will skew an EV/EBITDA calc.\n\nThe EV metric should never be used on its own, but rather to get a snapshot of the business\u2019 overall health. Investors should\n\nNet Net Working Capital To Net Current Asset Value\n\n**Value Investing Checklists**\n\n*Ben Graham*\n\n1. An earnings\\-to\\-price yield at least twice the AAA bond yield.\n2. A price\\-earnings ratio less than 40 percent of the highest price\\-earnings ratio the stock had over the past five years.\n3. A dividend yield of at least two\\-thirds the AAA bond yield.\n4. Stock price below two\\-thirds of tangible book value per share.\n5. Stock price two\\-thirds \u201cnet current asset value.\u201d\n6. Total debt less than book value.\n7. Current ratio greater than two.\n8. Total debt less than twice \u201cnet current asset value.\u201d\n9. Earnings growth of prior ten years at least 7 percent on an annual basis.\n10. Stability of growth of earnings in that no more than two declines of 5 percent or more in the prior 10 years.\n\n*Walter Schloss*\n\n1. Ten\\-year track record\n2. No long\\-term debt\n3. A low price\\-to\\-book value ratio\n4. A stock at hear 52 week low\n5. High insider ownership\n\n*Joel Greenblatt*\n\n1. While studying the footnotes is crucial, the big picture is most important: Earnings yieldand ROIC are the two most important factors to consider, with the key being figuring outnormalized earnings.\n2. High earnings yield, based upon normalized earnings, is important in order to have amargin of safety. High ROIC \\(again based on normalized earnings\\) simply tells you howgood a business it is.\n3. Independent thinking, in\\-depth research, and the ability to persevere through near\\-termunderperformance, are three keys to being a successful value investor.\n4. Worrying about near\\-term volatility has nothing to do with being a successful valueinvestor.\n5. Think of a concentrated portfolio as if you lived in a small town and had $1 million toinvest. If you have carefully researched to find the best 5 companies, the risk is minimal\\(As Charlie Munger says, \u201cThe way to minimize risk is to think.\u201d\\)\n6. Special situations are just value investing with a catalyst.\n7. International investing may offer the best opportunity, at least in terms of cheapness.\n8. Finding complicated situations that no one else wants to do the work to figure out is away to gain an advantage. \\(You have discussed and given examples of many suchsituations in your book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius.\\)\n9. Looking at the numbers best way to learn about management. What have they done withthe cash? What are the incentives? Is the salary too high? Is there heavy insider selling?What is their track record?\n10. Focus on understanding and buying good businesses on sale, and don\u2019t worry about themacro economy. Everything is cyclical, so value can always be found somewhere.\n11. Focus on situations that are not of interest to big players \\(usually small\\- and mid\\-cap,although currently large caps are cheap; spin\\-offs may be such opportunities, but the keyis to figure out the interests of insiders; bankruptcies, restructurings, and recapitalizationsmay also be such opportunities\\).\n12. Trust no one over 30, and no one under 30; must do your own work, rather than simplyride coat\\-tails.\n13. Risk is permanent loss of invested capital, and not any measurement of volatility developed by statisticians or academicians.\n14. All investing is value investing and to make a distinction between value and growth ismeaningless.\\) Thus, you understand the context of value investing. The most important step, which you have already completed, is to understand the market in context. If your investments go down, but you have done your homework, then understanding this broader context means that the short\\-termunder\\-performance should not bother you. Again, understanding this context is crucial whenthings don\u2019t go your way.

When you\u2019re looking at a company, it\u2019s impossible to identify the honesty and integrity of every employee.\n\nBut the culture a management team creates peters down through an organisation. If the management are honest, the employees will be too.\n\n\u2022 An Easy To Understand Business \\- Buffett looks for uncomplicated business in his investing areas \\(something he called his strike zone\\)\n\n**Growth Investing**\n\n*Zulu Principles*The Zulu principles were coined in Jim Slater\u2019s investing book \u201cThe Zulu Principle\u201d. The concept is to buy companies which analysts are forecasting will increase earnings but that are trading at a low price relative to earnings.\n\nCriteria:\n\n\u2022 Low PEG \\(price\\-earnings ratio relative to the growth rate\\) .075\n\n\u2022 PE ratio of \\&lt;20\n\n\u2022 Strong cash flow per share. The preferred criteria is a pe of 10\\-20 with a forecasted increase in earnings by 15&amp;#37;\\-30&amp;#37;.\n\n\u2022 Solid competitive advantage \\(high ROIC and good operating margins\\)\n\n*Scuttlebutt method* \n\nPhilip Fisher was a famous growth investor and the scuttlebutt was the formula he outlined in his 1957 book \\- Common Stocks Uncommon Profits.\n\nThe scuttlebutt method is a series of criteria for investing in a stock.\n\n1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizeable increase in sales for at least several years?\n2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have been exploited?\n3. How effective are the company\u2019s research and development efforts in relation to its size?\n4. Does the company have an above\\-average sales organization?\n5. Does the Company have a worthwhile profit margin?\n6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?\n7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?\n8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations? Does management hire from within? Are salaries regularly reviewed? Is their confidence in the president and/or the chairman?\n9. Does the company have depth to its management?\n10. How good are the company\u2019s cost analysis and accounting controls?\n11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competitors?\n12. Does the company have a short\\-range or long\\-range outlook to profits?\n13. Does the management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well but \u201cclam up\u201d when troubles or disappointments occur?\n14.

Similarly reddit users who are interested in stocks, options or any kind of investment possess very valuable information that we can all use for to our best advantage to make money and that is by creating a virtual fund free from any organization or people or clients just a group of indivual  \u201cIndependent investors\u201d . These independent investors will post their stock picks and their returns and i am sure some of them have year to year percentages return than some Etfs or index funds or just brokers. In a utopian world ofcourse it would be sensible if i invested my money in reddit users who prove they can do something and have good stock picks. I invest in their expertise , i have ROI they take a percentage on my ROI by just working independently using their own startegies.
