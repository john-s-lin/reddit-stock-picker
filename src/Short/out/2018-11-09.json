The index is a simple 100 day moving average of 14 day RSI, intended to give you an idea at a glance where a company's strength currently sits at and help you decide whether or not to trade it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe index is plotted as a histogram which identifies a weak company at under 50 (the blue mid line) and a strong company at over 50. The reason this is important is to give you an idea of a company's overall strength, and whether or not it has a track record of bouncing back from oversold territory or crashing at overbought territory. Here are some practical examples and pictures:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://gyazo.com/19e37d71fe3d382357ff984d682186a0](https://gyazo.com/19e37d71fe3d382357ff984d682186a0) This shows the indicator on GE since 2011. When the indicator is red and lower in the graph, the company is at its weakest point. As it rises it strengthens. When it crosses the midpoint at 50, it indicates strength. As we can see at the current point, it is weak and getting weaker. The practical use, if you trade options based on RSI, would be to see that this company is overall averaging a low RSI and buying calls in oversold territory may not end up being profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://gyazo.com/a1581fe63789699652a43c781b6b841a](https://gyazo.com/a1581fe63789699652a43c781b6b841a) This is Visa since 2011. Very strong, as you can see. It was averaging over 60 RSI before the great October recession, which is incredibly good. Buying calls in oversold territory for a company like this will probably work out well for you. (I bought the dip in October and made a huge return.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://gyazo.com/101a5192efb4c4c1d7fd85e24ddfa734](https://gyazo.com/101a5192efb4c4c1d7fd85e24ddfa734) This is Snapchat in the last year. It's a pile of garbage, as you can see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://gyazo.com/eeb9972b1cdf7e94c80f33e6af3f7a55](https://gyazo.com/eeb9972b1cdf7e94c80f33e6af3f7a55) This is Apple since 2015. Isn't that beautiful?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo reiterate the use of this for options, if you trade based on RSI you may buy puts in overbought territory (over 70) and calls in oversold (under 30.) I do this and it is a solid strategy. However, after going back and reviewing my losers and winners, this trend was a reliable indicator. My losers were companies that showed red on this indicator, and my winners showed green.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you guys find some use out of it!

Scheduled to enter LULU positions on Mon 11.12.2018\n\nThere are 3 PDFs below - please read and study in the sequence provided:\n\n1. LULU Fundamental Analysis briefing.\n2. LULU Technical Analysis briefing.\n3. LULU Options Analysis briefing.\n\nStrategy: Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread and is designed with very specific Objectives:\n\n4. To exploit true Dominant Trend bullish continuation moves after Pull-Back phases and allow Price Action to hit Weekly &amp; Monthly Target Levels that truly provide High R options call gains.\n\n5. But Pull-Backs can lead to deeper Pull-Backs. But using this Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread strategy - when we enter into the Pull-Back zone - and do so with a Net Credit Entry Basis, then even if the LULU Pull-Back goes deeper yet - the position will suffer NO LOSS - but instead gain a marginal (+$100 to $120) per (+3)/(-1) spread arrangement. Each (+3)(-1) spread requires about $3400 Margin.\n\nHere are the Summary Specific Expected Results for LULU - just remember this will be for each $3400 Margin for placing a (+3)(-1) Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread position:\n\nLULU is at $142.27 ----&gt; Earnings Date is 12.04 or 12.05.2017 which is about 25 calendar days out. The LULU Options IV is HIGH at the 83%ile IV Ranking.\n\nLULU had two Price Gaps upside over the past few months - and recently at the current Pull-Back - LULU has closed Gap 1. There is a 2nd Gap at the $108.37 price level.\n\nAfter you read the detailed Briefings of the 3 PDFs - you should be able to SEE these 1st BINARY EVENT OUTCOMES expected:\n\n6. Outcome 1 ----&gt; LULU goes higher from $142.27 to hit Target 1 at $180.79 (profit +$2124 per $3400 Margin) ----&gt; if hit Target 2 at $199.49 (profit +$5140 per $3400 Margin). So if you use a Betting Level of $10k (actually $10.2k) for a (+9)(-3), and if LULU moves upside from here ----&gt; at Target 1 of $180.79 the estimated profit is (+$6300) and at Target 2 of $199.49 the estimated profit is (+$15.3k).\n\n-- OR --\n\n7. Outcome 2 ----&gt; LULU moves lower to CLOSE Gap #2 down to the $108.37 to $110 Confluence Support Level ----&gt; then the (+3)(-1) Bullish Call Diagonal Back-Spread will NOT SUFFER LOSSES ---&gt; instead is estimated to have a very small profit of (+$100 to $120) per $3400 Margin or per (+3)(-1) or if you use (+9)(-3) ----&gt; then even with DIRECTIONAL BET 100% WRONG ----&gt; can still have a small profit estimate of (+$300 to +$360).\n\nIf Outcome 2 happens and LULU moves down to $108.37 to $110 price zone ----&gt; then we can re-establish a new (+3)(-1) per $3400 Margin spread again at the lower level AND DO SO WITH $0 out-of-pocket to your account! In addition the original long (+3) calls of the (+3)(-1) per $3400 Margin will still be open and \"free\".\n\nThen at the $108.37 to $110 Confluent Support Zone ----&gt; LULU can really be expected to move back higher toward the $180 and $199 Target 1 &amp; 2 levels. At this point - with the new (+3)(-1) spreads opened when LULU is at $110 ----&gt; your $$$ returns will be very high.\n\nRemember - if LULU explodes higher after Earnings on 12.04 or 12.05.2018 ----&gt; and LULU hits $199.47 Target 2 ----&gt; on a $10k betting using a (+9)(-3) strategy - you stand to profit estimate at ($15K+).\n\nI hope you can appreciate the detailed PDF briefing reports - and see the powerful (+3x)(-1x) Bullish Call Diag Back-Spread Plan for LULU.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to ask me your questions, potential LULU scenarios, Options-related issues, etc\n\nLULU
