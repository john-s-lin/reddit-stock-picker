"Geely/Li Shufu just bought 9% of Mercedes Benz. As someone who lived in China for a long time, I can count on one hand how many Mercedes Benz vehicles I saw there. You have basically everything else, but I very rarely saw Mercedes being driven around for whatever reason\n\nThat coupled with Geely being able to now tap into Mercedes and their electrical vehicle expertise is a huge connection. I've been in for 3 months, missed the opportunity to buy more on their recent pullback\n\nThis is a screaming buy if you ask me. Especially since Beijing wants 90% of vehicles to be electric by 2025 \n\nGeely also owns all of Volvo who expects to be 100% electrical by 2019", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Geely and Mercedes Benz", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/80007t/geely_and_mercedes_benz/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519531514, "crosspost_parent": "t3_8023p0", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "SeekingTheta", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "clicked": false, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1519560296, "created_utc": 1519531496, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.seekingtheta", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "id": "8023p0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_8023p0", "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/seekingtheta/comments/8023p0/going_to_change_my_username/", "pinned": false, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "report_reasons": null, "rte_mode": "markdown", "saved": false, "score": 0, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "friends, i have been memeing to death. it's also not the first time i have memed an account to its fullest. so to be more tactile and serious, i have decided to completely restart my account from scratch to avoid having to eat a shoe. some of you will know who i am and many of you will never know who I once was: a never-shoe-eater.
