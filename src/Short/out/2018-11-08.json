That's because Amazon is dedicated to giving customers lower prices, fast-delivery and excellent service in every category in which it competes.\n\nThat pays off in measurable ways.

Hosting the World\u2019s Best CEO\n\nThe\u00a0$163.6 billion\u00a0man (up from $131 billion in March), Jeff Bezos, is the world\u2019s top CEO. As I pointed out in Disciplined Growth Strategies, companies that sustain 20% or higher growth after they hit $10 billion in revenue share four traits, which Bezos brings to life better than any other business leader:\n\nHe\u2019s a founder who propels his public company\u2014 something he\u2019s been doing for over two decades;\n\nHe leads enormous markets by giving consumers a better deal;\n\nHe attracts and motivates the most talented people in the world through his vision, charisma and ability to execute; and\n\nHe keeps investing in growth opportunities\u2014learning from failures and expanding where he finds success.\n\n\n2. Creating a Culture of Customer Value\n\nAmazon is well-known as a very harsh place to work. Indeed, in August 2015, the New York Times highlighted the brutality of Amazon\u2019s work culture. Sadly, for workers, such brutality is not unique to Amazon\u2014Netflix also is a nasty place to work.\n\nThe architect of that culture, Patty McCord, noted that Netflix prided itself on being a great place to have been booted from. Then she was fired by CEO Reed Hastings.\n\nBoth these companies\u2014and other fast-growing companies\u2014are tough places to work because they are trying to win and keep winning. In order to do that, they must have a crystal clear idea of their values and mission and be willing to do whatever is possible to turn those ephemeral words into measurable value.\n\nAmazon is leaving a trail of failures in its wake\u2014one needs only look at the liquidation of Toys R Us for the latest example. That\u2019s because Amazon is dedicated to giving customers lower prices, fast-delivery and excellent service in every category in which it competes.\n\nThat pays off in measurable ways. According to the\u00a0American Customer Satisfaction Index, Amazon beats its rivals with a customer satisfaction score of 85 (down from 86 in 2016)\u2014a lead it has sustained for the last 18 years.\n\nIt also makes it hard to attack Amazon on antitrust grounds\u2014as long as it does not start raising prices where it enjoys a big market lead, Amazon will have a strong legal defense against those who try to argue for its breakup.\n\n\n3. Growing Through New Products And Acquisitions\n\nAmazon started selling books online in 1994 and today, with $208 billion in last twelve months\u2019\u00a0revenue growing at a 24% average rate over the last five years, controlled 40% of the e-commerce market, according to the Journal.\n\nThat growth has come by adding new product categories and acquisitions. Indeed Amazon has added 30 product categories including millions of products and has acquired over 100 companies, according to the Journal.\n\n\n4. Turning Capabilities Into New Profit Streams\n\nWhile Amazon has made many big bets on growth opportunities, the one that impresses me most is its creation of Amazon Web Services by productizing the systems it built to operate its e-commerce business.\n\nAWS dominates the cloud and accounts for most of Amazon\u2019s profit. \u201cAccording to a 2015 Gartner report, AWS ran more than 10 times as much computing capacity in use as the next 14 cloud providers combined. About 10% of Amazon\u2019s 2017 revenue \u2014 and a majority of its operating income \u2014 stemmed from the service,\u201d wrote in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe story of how AWS stays ahead in the cloud\u00a0is worth reading \u2014 I wrote about it\u00a0here.\n\n\n5. Fighting Complacency\n\nFor too many companies, success leads to failure. That\u2019s because the CEOs in those companies tend to believe that success means that they are doing everything right and therefore can safely ignore upstart rivals, evolving customer needs, and new technologies.\n\nAmazon has the opposite idea\u2014which is reflected in its Day 1 philosophy, meaning that every day, the company asks what it would do to win if it were starting from scratch.\n\nMany ideas have emerged from that mindset. For example, Amazon created its $99 a year Prime service which includes \u201cunlimited two-day shipping program for about a million products, free Kindle books, photo storage and music,\u201d according to the Journal.\n\nPrime is popular, and Amazon is investing to keep up with demand for it. The Journal wrote:\n\nCowen analysts estimate that 53.8% of U.S. households with internet are now Prime members. And Amazon is investing heavily in warehouses located close to cities\u2014adding about 130,000 full- and part-time U.S. jobs through mid-2018\u2014to fulfill the flood of orders in just two days.\n\n\n\nTL;DR As long as Jeff Bezos remains CEO, I am betting on Amazon.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 293511, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "5 reasons why I predict Amazon will hit 4,000 in the next 18 months", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9ve646/5_reasons_why_i_predict_amazon_will_hit_4000_in/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "neocoff", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1zbqquaf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541718987, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9vf2ga/what_do_you_think_about_weed_stocks/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9vf2ga", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9vf2ga/what_do_you_think_about_weed_stocks/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1541718988, "score": 1, "selftext": "Is today just profit taking from yesterday's green?
