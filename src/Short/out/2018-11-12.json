Airbnb is struggling in the business travel space because the biggest perk of business travel is earning loyalty points which you can then use towards personal travel. \n\nWith traditional hotel rewards however, you need to pay for roughly a seven night stay to earn enough points for a single free night. Given such, there's no instant gratification because it will likely take you multiple business trips to earn enough points for a free vacation stay. \n\nAirbnb can change this by launching a loyalty program where points can be used towards Airbnb Experiences. Then, after a short business trip, you can earn enough points to do a local experience through Airbnb for free like a guided bike tour of the city before heading home. \n\nAirbnb's ability to create a loyalty program which offers instant gratification is a huge differentiator which could help them rapidly capture business travel market share.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 294159, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I predict Airbnb will release a loyalty program for business travelers in the next six months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9whrep/i_predict_airbnb_will_release_a_loyalty_program/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "TisJeBoiJeroen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_24bp6ur4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542035781, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wetyk/what_is_your_opinion_on_the_recent_economic/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wetyk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9wetyk/what_is_your_opinion_on_the_recent_economic/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542035782, "score": 1, "selftext": "When I look at the market as a newbie I tend to compare it with the past.

I don't need to predict anything, just show which variables are reated to the response.\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 294129, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help with university project!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wgsme/help_with_university_project/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "TopPics777", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2l4xpqyx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542052247, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9whf4l/this_weed_stock_will_go_from_200_to_2000_upon/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9whf4l", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9whf4l/this_weed_stock_will_go_from_200_to_2000_upon/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542052257, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 294147, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This weed stock will go from $2.00 to $20.00 upon News of CBD &amp; TCH infused teas &amp; PRODUCTS the ticker is $DTEA there due to Put out a Press Release before Thanksgiving Buy $DTEA u will Thank me !", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9whf4l/this_weed_stock_will_go_from_200_to_2000_upon/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "heidelbergjohn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_lgvas", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542036860, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wezgj/i_havent_paid_taxes_in_years/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wezgj", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9wezgj/i_havent_paid_taxes_in_years/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542036862, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 294071, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I Haven't Paid Taxes in Years", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wezgj/i_havent_paid_taxes_in_years/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "LearnedTrader", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ihj2fz0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542045668, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wgayb/how_far_do_you_look_back/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wgayb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9wgayb/how_far_do_you_look_back/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542045670, "score": 1, "selftext": "Out of curiosity, How far do you go back when looking at price action? ...
