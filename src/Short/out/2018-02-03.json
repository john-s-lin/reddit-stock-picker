Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of February 5th, 2018 here at r/stocks!\n\n# **WEEK AHEAD: Scary Friday could lead to scary Monday for markets** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/scary-friday-could-lead-to-scary-monday-for-markets.html)*\n\n*****\n\n&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.\n*****\n&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.\n*****\n&gt; \"How long has it has been since we've had a scary Friday, and a whole scary weekend until we see what Monday is like?\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \"The other thing that got me, leading up to this week, is that good news stopped helping stocks.\"\n*****\n&gt; The stock market sell-off was tied to a sell-off in bonds, and bond strategists were reluctant to call a direction for interest rates in the week ahead, after the unusual volatility of the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \"The sell-off has been pretty violent,\" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \"Normally I'd say if you have some 40 basis point move in the 10-year, it's better looking for long-term investors.\"\n*****\n&gt; But that may not be clear until trading opens up again in the Asian session early Monday, and really not until the markets move past the Treasurys $66 billion in auctions of 3-, 10-year and 30-year bonds, Tuesday through Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; This past week, the Treasury announced higher issuance at those auctions, and that also spooked bonds, which have been anticipating a surge in new debt this year.\n*****\n&gt; Jerome Powell is sworn in as Fed chair Monday, after Janet Yellen leaves the post over the weekend. There are a number of Fed speakers in the coming week, and they may have comments about inflation but the markets are mostly looking forward to the Fed forecasts after its March meeting and Powell's comments at his first press briefing after that meeting.\n*****\n&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, had also been rising on inflation expectations and the idea that the Fed and other central banks could raise interest rates and tighten policy. But then the January employment report Friday included the best wage gains since 2009. That sent rates spiking, and the 10-year jumped to 2.85 percent, its highest level since January 2014.\n*****\n&gt; \"The market obviously got a little ahead of itself and all it took was the sell-off in bonds to show us that. Meanwhile, earnings are fine,\" said Bob Doll, chief U.S. equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. \"Tell me where the 10-year yield is going to end up in this noisy period. If it stops going up, stocks will probably stop going down.\"\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market is adjusting to the idea that the Fed could have to raise interest rates more than the three times it forecast for this year.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said ifthe 10-year gets close to 3 percent that could be problematic for stocks. \"If yields stop here, this correction is likely going to be one of a combination of price and time correction ... sideways choppy, volatile for a number of weeks but not material downside. But if politics stay in the headlines and rates continue to rise, that's how you get the big move to the downside.\"\n*****\n&gt; Washington will continue to be a focus as Congress faces a Feb. 8 budget deadline and markets watch for fallout from the House intelligence committee release of a GOP memo on the Russian investigation.\n\n*****\n\n*[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/scary-friday-could-lead-to-scary-monday-for-markets.html)*\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8gbTlNG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/snJSPf1.png)**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/aB6pLMh.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/4I2akOX.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DVtqeWN.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wXQSSTD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cOCpDkC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/l4hyFsC.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# A Big January Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, \u201cSo goes January, goes the year.\u201d With stocks seeing one of the best January returns ever, it is time to take a closer look at the January barometer. The January barometer was first discussed by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac in 1972. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year and vice versa if we see a red January.\n\n&gt; Looking at the numbers confirms that when the S&amp;P 500 Index is green in January the rest of the year (final 11 months) is up 12.2% on average, well above the average return of 7.9% over the final 11 months of the year; but when that first month is red the final 11 months are up only 1.2% on average. According to Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist, \u201cThe January barometer isn\u2019t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month is up more than 5% (like 2018 is on track to be), the return over the final 11 months actually gets stronger.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?w=522&amp;h=213))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; Of course we don\u2019t suggest simply investing based on what the first month does, but with the overall global economic backdrop and corporate earnings growth as strong as it appears to be, this is yet another sign that 2018 may see a continuation of the bull market.\n\n&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% at the end of January, the full year return has never been negative (higher 12 out of 12 times); but it is worth noting that they weren\u2019t smooth rides. The average peak-to-trough correction was 10.7%, while the smallest intra-year pullback was -4.4%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/january-momentum-can-lead-to-continued-gains.png?w=522&amp;h=436))**\n\n&gt; As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary, we are on the lookout for added volatility in 2018 as the economic cycle ages, but we would use any pullbacks to add to portfolio positions. This study is another example as to why we expect the bull to continue, but to be ready for a potentially bumpy ride.\n\n*****\n\n# Why Midterm Years Can Slip Up Bull Markets\n\n&gt; Equities were met with tremendous success during the first year of President Trump\u2019s term, but now we\u2019re headed into the much more historically troublesome midterm year. As Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist notes, \u201cMidterm years tend to be a banana peel for markets, as they see the largest pullbacks out of the four-year presidential cycle. However, those who hang on for the ride tend to see a significant bounce over the next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; Taking a closer look, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been down 16.9% on average at its intra-year low during midterm years, though it tends to bounce back, posting an impressive 32.0% average gain over the subsequent twelve months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/could-stocks-be-due-for-a-big-pullback-this-year.png?w=522&amp;h=170))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; Now take a look at all of the midterm years and how the S&amp;P 500 performed after the intra-year lows were made:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/here-is-a-breakdown-of-all-the-midterm-years-and-how-the-sp-500-performed-after-the-lows-were-made.png?w=522&amp;h=541))**\n\n&gt; The action over the past year has been historic on many levels, but we have our concerns as the bull market continues to move higher. In our next Weekly Market Commentary, due out later today, we will list some of the amazing streaks which make the recent market action truly special, but we will also look at a few other potential near-term worries which could trigger some long overdue volatility.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.4.18 - How Bad Was It?** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2IukVRZcd8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis for Week Ending 2.2.18** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpXaWgnOHb0))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NVDA** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$SWKS** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$DIS** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$GM** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$AGN** \n&gt; * **$TEVA** \n&gt; * **$TTWO** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$COHR** \n&gt; * **$SYY** \n&gt; * **$REGN** \n&gt; * **$NTES** \n&gt; * **$FEYE** \n&gt; * **$ARNC** \n&gt; * **$CVS** \n&gt; * **$EXPE** \n&gt; * **$SKX** \n&gt; * **$HES** \n&gt; * **$BAH** \n&gt; * **$CMI** \n&gt; * **$OCLR** \n&gt; * **$GOLD** \n&gt; * **$CHD** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$LITE** \n&gt; * **$GRUB** \n&gt; * **$CTLT** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$KORS** \n&gt; * **$MCY** \n&gt; * **$TRVG** \n&gt; * **$ONVO** \n&gt; * **$PM**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hdBduZv.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/cdTZDMX.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the most notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming week ahead which includes the time of release &amp; estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers.\n\n*****\n\n# **Monday 2.5.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/tmJiQad.png))\n\n# **Monday 2.5.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/jK9Xx93.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Tuesday 2.6.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/zFRGhpI.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/pIjHQF9.png))\n\n# **Tuesday 2.6.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/eko3s7v.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/ciISyRb.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Wednesday 2.7.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/MyldeYI.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/y34Zj2H.png))\n\n# **Wednesday 2.7.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/6wVKDfk.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/DfA6U8y.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3](https://i.imgur.com/DfA6U8y.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Thursday 2.8.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/IqvW1Dk.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/RVgYNJX.png))\n\n# **Thursday 2.8.18 After Market Close:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1](https://i.imgur.com/sO8GOlq.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2](https://i.imgur.com/quljgK7.png))\n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3](https://i.imgur.com/dceegTZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 2.9.18 Before Market Open:** \n###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES](https://i.imgur.com/cVM4q5I.png))\n\n*****\n\n# **Friday 2.9.18 After Market Close:**\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NVIDIA Corp. $233.52\n&gt; **NVIDIA Corp.
