Bull markets can also refer to other markets like housing, investment, or commodities.\n\nEven though it is not easy to predict when a bull market will occur, they are too often the outcome of a robust gross domestic product (GDP), high investor confidence, declining unemployment rates, an improved demand for stocks, and corporate and investor profits.\n\nThe three principal stock indices \u2013 Nasdaq (NDAQ),\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW), and S&amp;P 500 \u2013 increase alongside each other during a bull market.\n\nExperts believe the stock market is experiencing the longest bull market ever, hitting 3,453 days on August 22nd,\u00a02018, from a low on March 9th, 2009.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 has had seven bull markets since 1970, five of them resulted in a market rise of over 100 percent.\u00a0The most significant bull markets of the past fifty years are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1970\u2019s** \u2013 In the seventies, assets grew quickly during several periods despite worries of financial turbulence. A protest started in 1974 came after a recession following the post-Second World War expansion. It lasted a little over six years. The S&amp;P 500 grew by 122 percent during that time and the decade also experienced high inflation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1980\u2019s** \u2013 The Reagan-era\u00a0bull market was the briefest of the five and the S&amp;P 500 increased more than 100 percent. On an annual basis,\u00a0however, it was the most well-performing bull market, with the S&amp;P growing 26 percent each year. It was powered by massive tax cuts and job creation, and record revenue creation. It lasted between August of 1982 and August of 1987.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1990\u2019s** \u2013\u00a0This bull market occurred during prosperous times, with healthy job growth in the United States and a tax relief act that made several stocks attractive. Tech companies flourished as the internet became accessible and ended in a robust bull market that went to great heights before failing in 2000. This bull market began in October of 1990 and lasted over nine years. The index rise was 417 percent overall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Early 2000\u2019s** \u2013\u00a0After the\u00a09/11 attacks and the dot-com bubble, this bull market went on from October of 2002 to October of 2007. Low-priced\u00a0interest\u00a0rates and lenient access to credit lines fueled this bull-run, which was mainly invested in the housing market. It stopped when estate prices started to drop due to the subprime mortgage disaster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Today** \u2013\u00a0Today\u2019s bull market is the longest ever, starting March of 2009. It has been fueled by record-low interest rates and the easygoing fiscal policies embraced by central banks which has made it inexpensive to borrow capital. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which decreased taxes paid by American corporations, have extended the current bull-run.\n\nsource: [https://goldsilverbitcoin.com/whats-bull-market-end-longest-one-ever/](https://goldsilverbitcoin.com/whats-bull-market-end-longest-one-ever/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 294790, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What\u2019s A Bull Market And How Did We End Up In The Longest One Ever?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xg0wv/whats_a_bull_market_and_how_did_we_end_up_in_the/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542301528, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xd0v7/rstocks_options_trading_thursday_nov_15_2018/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9xd0v7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9xd0v7/rstocks_options_trading_thursday_nov_15_2018/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542301529, "score": 1, "selftext": "These stock options discussions run every Thursday.\n\nFeel free to talk about options you have or ask questions on options.

the cost of buying the spread combo is lower than just buying a call, however this reduces your max profit, but also reduces your max loss \n * **Credit call spread** (vertical credit spread) - generally a *bearish* combo that involves selling a call and buying a call at a lower strike; this reduces your max loss compared to just selling naked, but it also reduces your max profit, however you get the full credit upfront\n * **Strangle** - Two naked options, a call and a put, this creates a *neutral* combo and you profit as price stays between the two strike prices\n * **Iron condor** - same as the strangle except with protection, reduced profit but also reducing your max loss\n* A thorough explanation of nearly every [option strategy explained by TastyTrade here](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn)\n * [Vertical debit spreads video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptxT5wdWfJQ) - Mike and his whiteboard\n * [Iron condors video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Q9BSaF7cY) - Mike and his whiteboard\n * [Iron Fly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqB7BGBLXYw) - Mike and his whiteboard\n* [Book recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8qfs14/options_book_list_review_of_all_books_that_helped/) by the options community at r/options (subscribe while you're at it)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is Theta,\" then google \"investopedia theta\" and click the investopedia article on it;

For those not around or who were younger at the time, Enron was regarded as one of the biggest and strongest companies of its period. Despite its reputation, the company had recently been plagued with scandals over the previous months and it seemed like there was no end in sight to them. Shareholders and employees remained somewhat cautiously optimistic or hopeful that things were being handled and controlled and that the company could still eventually get over the hump and fix itself. Unfortunately, the exact opposite happened.\n\n\nWhen Enron released their financial reports that November day, it became clear the company was in an extremely troubling situation with massive debt and various instances of inconsistent, strange accounting on its hands. The company was facing insolvency and it became clear that the accounting scandals ran much deeper than what was originally believed. The market demonstrated the loss of faith and confidence in the company by consumers and shareholders alike with the stock falling over 20% over the course of the day. Bankruptcy was now on the table and would later occur just a few weeks later in December resulting in one of the biggest falls from grace for a publicly traded company. \n\n\nThe company would officially become defunct in November 2004 and has left a nasty taste in the mouths of many that is still remembered and talked about today.\n\n\nSome members of the company faced criminal charges and were even sentenced to prison time for their roles in the scandal. Enron shareholders and employees filed a lawsuit against the company, which would eventually end in several settlements being awarded to the victims of the scandal. Many still felt they were under-compensated and the loss of money and employment of those impacted by the scandal was certainly tragic. Those relying on Enron for their pensions or employment were left feeling misled, taken advantage of, and frankly screwed. Enron shareholders lost over $74 billion between 2001 and the company\u2019s end in 2004.  Taken from Wikipedia:\n\n\n&gt;As Enron had nearly $67 billion that it owed creditors, employees and shareholders received limited, if any, assistance aside from severance from Enron. To pay its creditors, Enron held auctions to sell assets including art, photographs, logo signs, and its pipelines. In May 2004, more than 20,000 of Enron's former employees won a suit of $85 million for compensation of $2 billion that was lost from their pensions. From the settlement, the employees each received about $3,100. The next year, investors received another settlement from several banks of $4.2 billion. In September 2008, a $7.2-billion settlement from a $40-billion lawsuit, was reached on behalf of the shareholders. The settlement was distributed among the main plaintiff, University of California (UC), and 1.5 million individuals and groups. UC's law firm Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman and Robbins, received $688 million in fees, the highest in a U.S. securities fraud case.\n\n\nThe situation with Enron raised various questions and concerns regarding just how easily a company can lie, coverup, and mislead the public by presenting false information and fixing their books. As a result, new regulations were implemented such as better and more frequent auditing, performed by outside, independent firms. Perhaps the biggest change to emerge from all this was the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which came about in 2002 and forced publicly traded companies to face stricter regulations and harsher penalties for failing them.\n\n\nCould another Enron situation occur today or is one even brewing as we speak? Are the current regulations in place enough to prevent a situation like this occurring again? Did the individuals involved in the Enron Scandal receive a fair enough punishment? How much can we trust what we\u2019re seeing from these companies today and how easily can we investors be misled or lied to?\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 294714, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Point in History: Enron's Bombshell", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xccw9/this_point_in_history_enrons_bombshell/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "QuantalyticsResearch", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bpylq8f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542318387, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xfn99/us_stocks_pm_news_recap_you_need_to_read_tech/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9xfn99", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "news", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "866eb162-65e6-11e5-a903-1252b640afe9", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9xfn99/us_stocks_pm_news_recap_you_need_to_read_tech/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1542318387, "score": 1, "selftext": " \n\n### US Markets End of Day Snapshot\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* US stocks rose strongly during the afternoon, rebounding from  losses earlier in the day, led by tech shares on hopes for a better  trade scenario\n* The S&amp;P 500 finished up 1.06%, Nasdaq Composite up 1.72%, and Russell 2000 up 1.44%\n* US stocks broke a 5 day losing streak with today's higher close\n* US Commerce Secreatary Wilbur Ross said the best that can be hoped  for near-term\u00a0is a \"framework\" for further trade talks with China and  that the real progress would come when the 2 countries leaders meet one  on one\u00a0\n* Tech (+2.46%), Energy (+1.48%), and Financials (+1.44%) stocks were the top performers in the S&amp;P 500 today\n* Consumer Staples (-0.33%), Utilities (-0.77%), and Real Estate (-0.9%) stocks were the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 today\n* Investor sentiment for US stocks finished positive with the advance/decline ratio for the S&amp;P 500 closing at 3.07x\n* 50 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 hit 4-week highs while 43 stocks reached 4-week lows\n* 11 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 closed overbought while 25 stocks closed oversold according to the 16-day RSI Measure\n* 41 stocks in the Nasdaq Composite hit 4-week highs while 237 stocks reached 4-week lows\n* 116 stocks in the Nasdaq Composite closed overbought while 467 stocks closed oversold according to the 16-day RSI Measure\n* The VIX closed\u00a0down 1.24\u00a0points today at 20.01\u00a0after closing at 21.25 yesterday\n\n### Stocks Trending in the News\n\nClick name for Q-Factor rating and financials data.  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Amazon (AMZN)**\u00a0continues  to receive criticism around the New York metropolitan area for the  amount of subsidies it is receiving for the move to Long Island City,  Queens. \u00a0New York state Senator Kirsten Gillibrand believed to be  considering a presidential run in 2020, criticized he deal in a tweet  yesterday. \u00a0Amazon reports on its site that New York government-state  and city-are providing USD$48,000 per expected created job, an enormous  sum for the protesting politicians. \u00a0Amazon is rated \u201cNeutral\u201d in our US  Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and \u201cTop Buy\u201d in our US Consumer  Discretionary Global Top Stock Ideas.\n* **Apple (AAPL)**\u00a0is  actively recruiting engineers in San Diego, the home of Qualcomm  (QCOM). \u00a0Apple is seeking mobile chip designers, an effort designed to  further weaken Qualcomm\u2019s ability to ever supply chips to Apple again.  \u00a0Apple and Qualcomm are due to face off in court in 2019 over their chip  spply contracts, this after Apple stopped buying chips from Qualcomm.  \u00a0Both parties are alleging the other owes it vast sums. \u00a0Apple is rated  \u201cNeutral\u201d in both our US Large-Cap and US Information Technology Global  Top Stock Ideas.\n* **Aston Martin Lagonda (LSE: AML)**\u00a0shares  are falling after reporting FY3Q2018 financials that disappointed  investors, despite nearly doubling sales y/y.
