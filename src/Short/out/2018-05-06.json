Based on my research, the stock price remains undervalued due to a lack of concrete earnings, and long-term investors getting tired of delays regarding their most advanced drug, RGN-259 eye drops. But I\u2019d say as a long-term investment it\u2019s now a strong buy as the price has potential to explode upward. \n\nThe next news we\u2019re expecting is the approval of RGN-259 for sales as soon as the phase 3 re-trial is completed. The re-trial will be the same as the recent phase 3 trial, but with a larger population sample size (to prove safety more accurately). Since the first 3 trials all went very well, the probability of any setbacks with the last re-trial is very low. It\u2019s about as close as I\u2019ve found to a sure-thing in a while (in terms of a new drug moving to market while stock price is this low). As always, do your homework and make your own decision \u2013 some quick resources are below.\n\nPipeline:\nhttp://www.regenerx.com/clinical-trials\n\nRecent news releases:\nFDA accepts RGN-259 phase 3 trial as valid, but requests a larger sample size to prove safety (this is why some long-term investors are frustrated with yet another delay):\nhttp://www.regenerx.com/2018-04-09-RegeneRx-Announces-Outcome-of-FDA-Discussions-for-Development-of-RGN-259-for-Dry-Eye-Syndrome\n\nRGN-259 completely heals over 40% of patients with neurotrophic keratopathy:\nhttp://www.regenerx.com/2018-04-25-GtreeBNT-Discloses-Preliminary-Observations-from-Seventeen-NK-Patients-Treated-with-RGN-259-Eye-Drops\n\nDry Eye syndrome trial (RGN-259) results beat other prescription meds and includes a better safety profile:\nhttp://www.regenerx.com/2018-05-02-ReGenTree-Presents-Results-of-a-Comparison-Study-of-RGN-259-and-Approved-Prescription-Drugs-for-Dry-Eye-Syndrome-in-a-Mouse-Model-at-ARVO\n\nValuation:\nCurrently sitting at $0.20 per share, but is considered to be very undervalued.

There is no definitive relationship as to which one leads/lags first\n\nIn other words, it's better to focus on the economic data when predicting the stock market than corporate earnings.\n\nhttps://bullmarkets.co/study-do-corporate-earnings-lead-the-stock-market/", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 235244, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Study: do corporate earnings lead the stock market?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8hkabt/study_do_corporate_earnings_lead_the_stock_market/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "MastadorAM65", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525657595, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8hk0dh/investing_for_college/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8hk0dh", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/8hk0dh/investing_for_college/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1525657596, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 235232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Investing for College", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8hk0dh/investing_for_college/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "popeinvest", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525654247, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8hjokh/please_rate_my_portfolio_suggestions_are_welcome/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8hjokh", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/8hjokh/please_rate_my_portfolio_suggestions_are_welcome/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1525654247, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 235221, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Please rate my portfolio; suggestions are welcome", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8hjokh/please_rate_my_portfolio_suggestions_are_welcome/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "MastadorAM65", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525661343, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8hkdms/investments/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8hkdms", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/8hkdms/investments/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1525661344, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey Everyone,\nI'm 18 years old and have 3 years left to go until I graduate from college. I am pretty new to investing and haven't invested in much yet except the 500 I have in betterment general investing. I have about 17k saved and work a full time job making around 2500 to 3000 a month. I wanted to know what the best options would be to help grow my wealth in the next 2-3 years to help with college tuition debt. I also want to invest long-term but saving for college is my main priority. I want to invest about 2500 but I am willing to put in more. I was watching stocks last year for a few months but then decided to wait until I had more money saved up and recently I have been watching the stock market again and trying to learn as much as I can about investing. I have interest in tech stocks like AAPL and MSFT and pharmaceuticals like JNJ. V is another one I have been watching closely. Would these be good investments or should I look towards ETFs such as VYM, ITOT, or SPX. I also understand that bonds are a steady income as well so I am also willing to invest in those if it will help build my wealth quicker.

I consider this a valuable knowelege to have and enjoy learning as much as I can.\n\n I was an avid swing trader with great success for about a year which allowed me to accumulate some wealth. I had one harsh lesson where I lost about 2k and brought me back down to reality a little, as well as neutered me when it comes to biotech investing. However TRVN looked to juicy despite their financials(not that financials are a major moving point in small biotech companies) and ive make a fast 5 or 6% in just a few days when I noticed the ETF IBB was a strong swing trade. A product with proven efficacy, safety, and is marketable is the goal here. Then a larger company will buy them out and you make bank, unfortunately I let emotions of past experience affect my investment amount. Its up 40% in I think about 2 months, and they already have brokered 2 partnerships in Asia. \n\nSo far in my 2 years of trading, Ive not only times markets with precision. Ive assumed correctly when to rotate out of sectors and into others. As for the meat, well kinda bragging but Im wondering due to my short experience if Im just constantly lucky. Which I consider the most logical explanation.\n\nWhen we had the run up in january I noped the fuck out of stocks.  Hastely, I went into bonds, a REIT ETF , and a few odds and ends. BABA has treated me well as for every 5% down I bought 5 more shares, then ive been selling back for an alright profit. I managed to pull off $190 limit orders on Friday halfing my position. The stock I have left was bough at I think $172.\n\nNow for a little proof so you dont think im just talking out of my ass [after then january runup I felt a correction was imminent and acted fast](https://imgur.com/a/glnAEr3). Is sold most my stocks I pulled out of financials with amazing results, id been lowering my positions beforehand as over 100% profit on BOA and 60% on MS seemed alright with me. Right now im at about 15% equities and need my investment money short term so plan to keep it that way unfortunately. \n\nSometimes I feel the mantra that you cannot time the market is something fed to us by institutions so they can take our money. From my 2 years experience, maybe its sheer luck. However I have timed the market and made changes with almost 100% success. If you look at the graph I posted you can see how I felt a correction coming beforhand. I realized most of my gains so thats why you see a small loss. BABA and VNQ are both up and not showing due to pending settlements so the actual amount is down -1.03% vs Also because my dividends on my bonds are mostly paid monthly I am much closer to -0.5% loss over the period of time. DJIA is down 7.22%\n\nAm I just getting really lucky? TBH I really feel its a mixture of both. My purpose of this post is not to just gloat. I want to know if there is some delusion in my mind as to my abilities to notice changes of trend in equities markets.
