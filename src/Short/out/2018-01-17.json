repetitive and predictable price movement patterns in specific time of year. We all know that summer follows spring than winter, autumn and spring again as human we are all deeply influenced by the cycles and the rhythm of nature and human-made events. Seasonal patterns occur in many financial markets: indexes, Stocks, Currencies, Commodities, Bonds Those patterns characterize by the tendency of the market to rise or fall in particular time of year. For example, End of Years Rally in stocks (Santa clause rally).\n\n#The Data\nThis kind of trick requires accurate historical data with both split adjustments and dividend adjustments, assuming that we reinvest any earnings to maximize the profit. Quality assured data is not easy to come by and will most likely cost you over 50 to 200 USD monthly.  \n\n#The Basics\nFirst, we need to set the base and time frame by which we compare. Let\u2019s choose to buy on EOD price and Selling on EOD price, the time frame would not be set in order to get the best results on all time frames (I\u2019ll explain later).\n\n#The Process\nThe process is simple to understand but not as simple to execute as there are many pitfalls that may hinder our outcome. \nWe now have our data and a basis to work with. There is a process we need to perform on each symbol we deem worthy (not all symbols are suitable for this as some lack the historical data or are simply not within the margin we select due to low volume or low price).\nFrom now on I\u2019ll address a single symbol, this operation will be executed on all symbols iteratively until we have a complete database of our processed data.\nThere are many types of cycles we can examine (Annually, Monthly, Weekly, Etc.), I\u2019ll choose the yearly cycle for our example.  As we selected Daily we need the daily change for our symbol.\nThis is the fun part, we now take every date span permutation in a year and calculate the historical statistics for that span (the permutations amount is in the magnitude of tens of thousands).\nAfter all of the symbols are iterated, our database is ready. I will not elaborate on the pruning process of eliminating unsuccessful spans as this is very personal and is determined by your risk appetite. I\u2019ll just say that I would not keep opportunities that show less than desirable our come or ones that show little reward for substantial risk.  \n\n#Validation\nHow do we assure we have a working seasonality model?  Like all trading strategies, that is not something we can be certain of but it\u2019s a matter of odds. we can show a level of certainty by backtesting our results. We calculate our database based on data up to 2016 (all years not including 2016 and on) and compare the opportunities we gathered with real results in 2016. \nWhat we got was ~70% success rate for specific kind of opportunities, ones that showed previous positive results of 85% meaning that if the stock had a history of 20 years prior to 2016, at least 17 years had yielded a profit.  \nwe did the same for 2017 and had pretty much the same results. \n\n#Opportunity picking\nOur database of opportunities is ready. All there is left to do is pick our \u201cmost likely to succeed\u201d opportunities based on our validation process. \n\n#Further Filtration and Perfection\nThis post is about getting the idea on how to calculate seasonality, it only shows the basics. We do employ many more means to perfect our results, such as stop-loss and money management tactics.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Method - Finding Seasonal Trading Opportunities", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r2b1k/method_finding_seasonal_trading_opportunities/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "REALSTOCKTIPS", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516214207, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r34p1/make_a_ton_of_money_today_3times_ur_investment/", "id": "7r34p1", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7r34p1/make_a_ton_of_money_today_3times_ur_investment/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516269271, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "MAKE A TON OF MONEY TODAY 3TIMES UR INVESTMENT TODAY HURRY BUY TICKER $$$$", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r34p1/make_a_ton_of_money_today_3times_ur_investment/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Hououin___Kyouma", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516225105, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r4j28/question_about_ba/", "id": "7r4j28", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7r4j28/question_about_ba/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516286270, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone know why $BA has had such a huge run up this year?

I've been reading a ton on a ton, sometimes it feels like there is so much information it can start to become overwhelming. Sometimes I don't know where to start, and sometimes I don't know where to stop. This is an immense project for anyone to start, and to the people who have 'made it'(everyone has their own definition of success' I have a tremendous amount of respect for you. It seems that, day trading, intraday trading etc. are minimized to, it's basically gambling and if you dump money in the stock market you're an idiot. I once did also subscribe to that ideology and now I realize I probably should have focused on that instead of partying with friends and making some bad decisions, but the wisest of men were once the greatest of fools said a smart guy one time, I think. Anyway just some background, I am in my early 20's and am assigned as an air traffic controller in a branch of the american military. I just developed a rough 'training plan' to get myself on the right track to being fiscally adept. The reason why I am posting is to search for some wisdom from the elders, someone that will take some time to just sift through a couple of my talking points to add or subtract some of my basic ideas, and basically just guide me in the right direction. It doesn't make much sense to go into these things blindly, especially with an area of study a whole career field is designed around. I want to develop a rough map / curriculum to follow for myself, and to try to measure any indicators (no pun intended) of progress. But I am just a beginner, so why not post this on reddit? If anyone has any tips, something to add, something to subtract, that's why this is here. I'll be around to answer any questions for the next hour or so, then I can pickup tomorrow. I'm hoping we as a community can come together with something to give to a beginner like me, with this being the beginning \n\nLINK TO GOOGLE DOCS -- HAS MORE CORRECT FORMATTING https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YTf0MMvFWdrvFlz_k-ruDuMABjaJEeZ5Aed07xEnEMI/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMy motivation \u2013 \n1. So I can give family, friends and myself a life without worry. So, we have more time to focus on building meaningful experiences and forming a strong relationship with each other.\n2. If profitable enough, to donate to cancer research to hopefully one-day cure cancer, more specifically, malignant brain cancers.\n3. To have financial freedom.\n4. To build wealth for myself and future generations of my family, regardless if it is my own kin. \n5. To challenge myself.\nHow I am doing this?\nAdopting a mix of education, research and simulated training I hope that by the end of CY18 I can have a small account funded 1500-3000 for trading while also focusing on paying down debt.\n\nEducation and Research:\nReading List\n1.\tSecurity Analysis \u2013 \na.\tTo gain a fundamental basis to judge a stocks worth, it has great reviews and has been recommended on multiple different platforms as a must read, so I am must reading it\nb.\tThis book will not relate to the trading strategy that will be adopted in the beginning to build greater wealth. However, I think this will become a staple of future trading strategies. This book is basically the polar opposite to speculative trading/investment which will comprise the trading the trading strategy used to develop the wealth needed to reach the 25k minimum needed to day trade. \n2.\tJapanese candlestick charting techniques (JCCT)--\na.\tThis book is allegedly a great source on learning candlestick patterns and learning technical analysis. \nb.\tThe focus will be learning how to read charts quick and effectively, allowing me to draw reasonable and insightful conclusions on the potential movement on stock based on its price-action\n3.\tWill add more to the list after I finish these, but as of now I have determined learning a mix between fundamental &amp; technical analysis will keep me well rounded so I don\u2019t tunnel vision one way of trading. The aim is to remain well rounded and not to rely on one skill too much. \n\nOnline resources \u2013\n1.\tYoutube\na.\tRicky Gutierrez \u2013 stocks\nb.\tTimothy Sykes \u2013 stocks\nc.\tThe Duomo initiative \u2013 Forex \nd.\tNumerous other youtube sources\n2.\tBabypips \u2013 Forex \n3.\tLehman Brothers \u201cForeign Exchange Training Manual\u201d (Dekstop)\n4.\tReddit? \n5.\tWill add more as they come\nSimulation\u2014\n1.\tTradingview.com\na.\tGood charts, great indicators, free \u2018real-time\u2019 data and awesome charting features available as well as an easy to use papertrading, seems like a good resource for FOREX/STOCKS\nb.\t\n2.\tTD Ameritrades ThinkOrSwim (TOS)\na.\t60 day Demo account that I called and got real-time data, the closest thing to a real deal trading platform I can get my hands. Will probably keep trying to learn this and use it as my basis for learning how to execute trades in the FOREX and Equity Markets. \nb.\tWhen the demo account runs out, make a new one, call and get live data set to the account again\n3.\tThe criteria used for the trading software\na.\tDon\u2019t make a lot of trades, I want to focus on only taking trades based on as much calculated risk as I can possibly calculate\nb.\tTrade around the pattern day trader rule, as when it\u2019s time to go live I want to be used to it. What this means for me, is only take 1 or 2 trades a week, and making them meaningful.\nc.\tTry to learn something from every trade I make, failure or success I want to know if it\u2019s pure luck or calculated risk. \ni.\tIF it\u2019s a failure, I want to analyze why it happened to the best of my ability. \nii.\tIf it\u2019s a success, I want to analyze how it happened and try to really solidify the knowledge.\nd.\tTry to imagine the money in the paper trading account is as real as the money in my pocket. \ne.\tDon\u2019t rush or force trades, wait for a good \u201cset-up\u201d or situation. Stick to my technical analysis tools/skills and adapt to changing situations based on news releases.\n\n\nTraining\u2014\n1.\tRead at least 30 minutes each day of either Security Analysis or JCCT\n2.\tUse youtube, babypips, reddit or some other online resource to learn SOMETHING that day. I don\u2019t care if I am rereading the Relative Strength Indicator equation, I will do some form of online research and make it meaningful or impactful in some way.\n3.\tUsing a simulation platform, most likely TOS, develop a strategy for taking trades during the week. Live by the criteria I set for myself.\na.\tUse each blown up paper account as lesson.\nb.\tStay focused and don\u2019t get emotional\nc.\tRome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\nd.\tGo live when I win more than I lose, and am green for 4 months.\n4.\tDon\u2019t forget who I\u2019m doing this for and why.\nTo-Do list \u2013 \n1.\tCompile a list of terms, phrases, vocabulary and indicators to define/research and call it homework \n2.\tFind or develop a good trading journal that is designed around a specific strategy, and before I enter into any trade I can fill it in this journal and if it meets criteria it\u2019s time to buy.\n3.\tMake myself some form of \u201chomework\u201d at-least once a week and learn from it.\n4.\tIf everything works out remain humble and try to help others succeed also. \nSummary \u2013\nThe goal is through a mix of, foundational reading (Security Analysis, JCCT and others), online resources, and simulated trading I can go from someone with very low to almost no knowledge of financial markets to a profitable and successful trader in the next 6-24 months. Using realistic and measurable goals to gauge progress (how many books have I read since I set the curriculum? How am I doing papertrading? Am I staying focused? Am I too focused?) as well as always constantly reforming and changing the training plan to grow with me I think this is possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adding to a prospective traders training plan", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r74xt/adding_to_a_prospective_traders_training_plan/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "Uilleam_Uallas", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516238239, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r61pq/baba/", "id": "7r61pq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7r61pq/baba/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516304374, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "What's your sentiment?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "$BABA", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r61pq/baba/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "TRichard3814", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516235902, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r5sjf/marijuana_stock_picks_january_17th/", "id": "7r5sjf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Discussion"}], "link_flair_template_id": "8acd2324-65e6-11e5-a263-122ab0778f8b", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7r5sjf/marijuana_stock_picks_january_17th/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516301835, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "I'm not claiming to be a legendary investor or anything I'm just going to attempt to use technical analysis and napkin math to make stocks picks in the cannabis industry\n\nI will publish my picks each month and check up on last months performances\n\nFollow along if you wish all stocks are for a 3 month holding period with strong 1 month gains\n\n\nPicks this month\n\nTHCX\nCatalysts incoming regarding Quebec supply agreement  which they will play a large part in as well as slowly decreasing production costs \n\n\n\nOGI.WT.A\nCheap leverage on a booming industry expiring in 2019 these are better then buying the companies stock because if it hasn't doubled by 2019 it is most likely bankrupt\n\nSmall recent supply agreement with PEI\n\n\n\n\nMARI\nCatalysts regarding incoming TSX up listing and others ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Marijuana stock picks January 17th", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r5sjf/marijuana_stock_picks_january_17th/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}, {"author": "MoonJaeIn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516228062, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7r4wai/how_do_you_guys_choose_your_etfs/", "id": "7r4wai", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/7r4wai/how_do_you_guys_choose_your_etfs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516290930, "score": 0, "selftext": "Background: Half of my portfolio is Vanguard Canadian index ETF.
