ITT, I would like to share a personal favorite stock of mine that I have been following, and have owned, for about six years now. (Consider this the disclosure, I am long on this stock.)\n\nWestern Forest Products (WEF:TSE) or (WFSTF:OTC) is a small-cap lumber &amp; logging company based out of Vancouver British Columbia (from hereon I will refer to Western Forest Products as WEF). I believe that WEF has it's own moat, although it is small, the company has some growth catalysts that should not go unchecked. One reason that this stock is one that I have followed so closely for so long, is that they are in a very unique position. Not just financially, but geographically as well. A majority of their operations are on Vancouver Island which has some of the highest annual rain fall in the pacific Northwest, as well as having all of their facilities being positioned to take advantage of rail or seaport access. \n\nCurrently, they have 6 mills that are running close to full capacity as well as 9 logging tenures that supply their mills internally as well as provide export options when their mills are saturated with supply. This bottleneck did occur on a handful of occasions before 2015, however this hasn't been an issue as of late due to their re-consolidation of milling volumes, and their successful $125M strategic capital program (approximately $100M of the 125M has been executed).  \n\nThe strategic capital program is probably one of the best uses of capital I have seen from a company that has proven to make quick returns while growing the business portfolio. Each of the mills received an array of improvements over the past 4 years, mainly the Duke Point, Saltair, and Ladysmith mills saw a bulk of the upgrades. The improvements made at Duke Point allowed for them to close down a lesser performing mill, effectively moving the closed mill volume to Duke Point which then pushed the returns even higher for the mill. 2017 was a year of generalized improvements across their entire asset base. \n\nWEF finished 2017 with a revenue of $1.1B, with a net income of $77M (adjusted EBITDA of $152M). Part of the strategic capital program was to help improve the companies operating margins and 2017 began to show this. Their books closed the year with no debt, $35M cash on hand as well as $269M in liquidity. With the rest of their SCP fully financed, the company is now looking for further growth opportunities. I expect this to be in the form of either biological assets (such as tree farms) or expanding distribution capabilities. Recently, they closed on a purchase agreement to buy a distribution center in Arlington Washington. This purchase was to help mitigate extra import tariff placed on Canadian timber products last year. \n\nWhile some look at the tariff as being a headwind it has only slightly dampened WEF's ability to sell it's product on US markets. Luckily, they are wildly diversified and do a lot of business with the far east (mainly China and Japan) and are now looking for more opportunities in Europe. WEF offers it's flagship product, Western Red Cedar onto all markets and has been showing extreme promise to provide ample revenue streams as countries look to build more environmentally friendly (WRC has one of the lowest carbon footprints for building materials). \n\n2018 should be another year of further growth, but should be increasingly accelerated due to increase demand from the far east, and management is expecting US housing starts to be higher YoY which will provide further opportunities. The Arlington Washington distro facility is expected to be fully operational by mid 2018, hopefully providing some return before the year end.\n\nAgain, just a disclose, I am long on this stock. Please do your own research. Feel free to give criticism, even if you hate my guts and think this was the worst stock write up ever. Thanks for reading!

One is an individual account that is 100% in FUSVX, a Fidelity S&amp;P500 index fund. One is a SEP IRA that is also all in on FUSVX. \n\nI want to transfer everything over to Interactive Brokers to take advantage of their low margin rate and buy SPY.\n\nIs there any way to avoid capital gains on the sale?

One of the main principles Graham insists on using is Dollar Cost Averaging, where you buy stock X during regular intervals, say every month. My question becomes, since it costs money to perform a transaction, won't this strategy eat into any profits you make? Every month you'll be spending a decent amount of money just from transaction fees.\n\nAlso since I am new, was wondering if you would recommend any other resources to learn proper investing, preferably videos?\n\nThank you in advance!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dollar Cost Averaging", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7y4r18/dollar_cost_averaging/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}]
