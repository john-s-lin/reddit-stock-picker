The mods and I have recently been discussing and going over a few ideas to increase discussion and make our subreddit a little more interesting. Some of you may have seen our recent additions to discussion threads and their topics. Something else we are now adding to our subreddit are occasional posts regarding historic or interesting events involving the stock market, investing, or the economy. I won\u2019t be doing these super often, mostly due to time constraints and because of the limitations of finding events that we feel are noteworthy enough. I also had a little bit of trouble coming up with a good name for these posts. For now, I\u2019ll be calling them \u201cThis Point in History\u201d but if anyone has a better or catchier name, I\u2019m all ears. I would also like to give a moment to give credit to the handful of history websites out there that helped with finding these topics.\n\nThe goal of these posts is to generate some discussion and educate readers about events that we feel were important and historic in nature. My idea is to present a topic/event, provide a brief description of it, and then turn the discussion to you guys. If anyone has any ideas or thoughts for upcoming events they would like to be discussed, again feel free to comment or message me as I\u2019m all ears. So, without further ado, let\u2019s go back to early November in the year 1907.\n\nThe US was a few weeks into an event which would later be called \u201cThe Great Panic 1907\u201d in which investor confidence sank deeply in the US banking system, economy, and stock market. The average American was skeptical on all fronts and a huge sense of distrust developed in these industries, the government, and amongst major businesses. Various stretches of \u201cbank runs\u201d occurred where people ran to withdraw their money from their local banks in fear of losing it or seeing its value further plummet. Americans called for stricter and tighter regulations on these banks and companies as stock manipulations schemes appeared more frequent than many initially thought. The New York Stock Exchange had fallen over 50% from its all-time highs in 1906. The third largest trust in the US, The Knickerbocker Trust, would fall by late October. Most of this stuff occurred in early fall but by early November things were looking particularly dire for the US.\n\nSeventy old banker John Pierpont Morgan (better known today as JP Morgan and for his company) stepped up to the plate to restore consumer confidence in early November 1907 by issuing money and cutting deals, both things aiding in the liquidity crisis that struck the US. Morgan was joined by other groups and wealthy individuals such John D. Rockefeller to find a way out of this crisis. If not for people like Morgan, Rockefeller, and others then things could have potentially turned much worse. To help prevent such future events, the Federal Reserve would be established only a few years later in 1913 and regulations were somewhat tighter than what they were less than a decade ago.\n\nJust over a hundred years later the world would face the Great Financial Crisis and while it appeared that we had learned from some of our mistakes of 1907, it was evident the system we had in place was far from perfect. Weak banking regulations are probably one of the first things that come to mind when comparing both events. While not quite the same, both events were fixed in part with the help of bailouts. Is the US in better shape today to prevent another event like 2008 or 1907 or is history doomed to repeat itself under a slightly different manner? What ways or actions can we take to prevent events like these occurring?  \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 293094, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Point in History", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uoo27/this_point_in_history/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "MonstaStocks", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_20pmciaw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541515854, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uoxmc/pyramidion_technology_group_inc_otc_pytg_exhibits/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9uoxmc", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9uoxmc/pyramidion_technology_group_inc_otc_pytg_exhibits/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1541515856, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 293096, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc.

To me this is lacking in most CBD companies but not LeafyWell. This came from their blog [https://www.leafywell.com/blogs/news](https://www.leafywell.com/blogs/news)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Leafywell - Your one stop shop for CBD needs!\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nWhat comes to your mind when I say Blueberry, Salted Cr\u00e8me Brulee, Watermelon and Monk Fruit?\n\nNaaah...We are not joking!\n\nBlueberry and Watermelon flavoured CBD oils are one of the many products available on [leafywell.com](https://www.leafywell.com/products/cbg-500mg-watermelon-flavor)\u00a0that are 100% natural, sugar-free and incredibly tasty!\n\n## Why Leafywell?\n\nLeafywell\u2019s slogan of *\u201cNature has a remedy\u201d*\u00a0translates to a high quality range of holistic medicine to cure myriad illnesses and disorders such as pain, anxiety, [insomnia](https://www.leafywell.com/blogs/news/cbd-oil-a-boon-for-insomnia)\u00a0etc. These vast arrays of products have minimal side effects as compared to traditional pharmaceutical medications.\n\nLeafywell believes in the natural healing and restorative powers of CBD, a compound found in the cannabis plant, which is now being hailed as the future of alternative medicine. Cannabinoids (CBD), one of the 85 ingredients found in the cannabis plant, has proven anti-inflammatory, antipsychotic, neuroprotective and analgesic properties.\n\n### Aren\u2019t all CBD products and companies the same?\n\nThough [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569602/)\u00a0show that CBD is safe and does not cause any adverse reactions prompting many users to switch from addictive and habit \u2013forming pharmaceutical options to CBD, a major area of concern is the quality of CBD being offered.\n\nThe rising popularity of CBD has seen dime a dozen retail and online stores mushrooming to make a quick buck at the cost of public health.\n\nOne major concern for a person using CBD for the first time is whether the quality and potency of the product being sold is true to its claim. A [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569)\u00a0that was conducted on 84 CBD based products that were purchased online from 31 companies reveals some startling information. The products were sent to a third party independent lab for blind testing, and out of the total sample, 26% had less CBD than advertised on the label(Over-labelled) and 42% had more CBD than advertised (Under-labelled).\n\nOnly 31% of the products had accurately reported the CBD content. While under labelling may not be problematic as CBD even in high doses does not produce a high or addiction and has minimal chance of abuse, Over-labelling may result in ineffective treatment as the required dosage for seeing positive results may be difficult to calculate because of the inaccuracy in labelling.\n\nThis shows the need for a more stringent regulatory framework for monitoring and testing cannabis based medicinal products.\n\n### How to choose the best quality CBD?\n\nThe first step to choose the highest quality CBD product is to check for the **process of extraction.**\u00a0There are mainly three ways in which CBD oil can be extracted namely\n\n* Low-priced methods of extraction which involve the use of toxic solvent like propane and butane which are extremely dangerous for your health.\n* Ethanol-based extraction, which is considered safe and reliable as it removes toxins from the plant and gives the highest yield.\n* Supercritical CO2-based extractions that yield the purest form of CBD oil and are the most advanced form of extraction which means you get the highest quality CBD product.\n\n***At Leafywell, we take pride in obtaining our CBD through supercritical CO2-based extraction ensuring that you get the best product that your money can buy.***\n\nThe quality of CBD is also directly dependant on the **quality of hemp**\u00a0being harvested. Hemp is known\u00a0as a \u201chyper accumulator\u201d, it essentially means that it absorbs everything in its surrounding and from the soil in which it is grown.\u00a0 If the soil is rich in pesticides or herbicides, mercury or lead then it can lead to the oils being contaminated with all the above.\n\n***Leafywell not only ensures that its entire hemp crop is devoid of any pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides but also that it is tested at each step of production right from sourcing to extraction to make sure that its potency information is accurate.***\n\nAnother test to make sure that you are buying a safe product is to check for **THC content**.\u00a0 Do check the labels or ask for lab testing certificates before deciding on one. ***Leafy well contains natural*** [***CBD hemp oil***](https://www.leafywell.com/search?q=CBD+hemp+oil)***, having a THC content of less than 0.3%, making it a reliable source for all your*** [***CBD needs.***](https://www.leafywell.com/blogs/news/cannabidiol-a-miracle-drug)\n\nChoose a product that is **full spectrum**\u00a0or made from the whole cannabis plant to maximize the \u201centourage\u201d effect and not just CBD isolates. ***Leafywell\u2019s products are all full spectrum ensuring that you get the full synergistic advantage of terpenes, flavonoids etc.***\n\nFinally a third-party lab testing report goes a long way to show that a company has nothing to hide and is committed to providing quality products. Most companies which make dubious claims do not have reports to back up their tall claims. Before deciding on a product, ask for the lab report to make an informed decision.\n\n***Leafywell has*** [***Certificate of Authentication (COA)***](https://www.leafywell.com/pages/coa-lab-results)\u00a0***obtained by independent third-party testing for its products readily available on its website if you wish to peruse them.***\n\n#### Different strokes for different folks!\n\nNot all of us like our martini shaken not stirred or our coffee black.\n\nLeafywell fully understands that the way one chooses to use CBD may differ from person to person, and so we have a variety of products and flavours to suit your needs.\n\nWe have products that can be applied externally or ingested such as\n\n* [Vape Pods](https://www.leafywell.com/search?q=vape)\u2013 Looking for a fast-acting solution? We have a range of plain and flavoured Vape pods that are JUUL compatible.\n* [CBD Oils](https://www.leafywell.com/search?q=CBD+oil)\u2013 Our array of full spectrum oils come in Plain, Blueberry and Watermelon flavours and have a range of add-ons like terpenes and natural flavouring agents to give you a well \u2013 rounded and delicious tasting product.\n* [Capsules](https://www.leafywell.com/products/hot-new-product-25mg-full-spectrum-cbd-capsules)\\- Enjoy the goodness of CBD in an easily ingestible form.\n* [Topical Balms](https://www.leafywell.com/search?q=balm)\u2013 A concoction made of Natural Hemp Seed oil, Avocado oil, Shea Butter and other essential oils it works like a charm when applied to the affected areas by reducing inflammation and pain.\n* [Bath Bombs](https://www.leafywell.com/search?q=bath+bombs)\u2013 The high absorption rate combined with relaxation and relief makes it an ideal choice for your bath at the end of a tiring day! Choose from a range of defence, tranquil, sensual, and utopian and recovery bath bombs to make your bath time a rejuvenating experience.\n* [Edible Gummies](https://www.leafywell.com/search?q=gummies)\\- CBD in edible form that comes in a plain and flavoured variant.\n\nSo go ahead enjoy the benefits of nature working its magic of healing on your body.\n\nThe key to having a positive CBD experience is to use highest quality products and we at leafywell are committed to providing you with just that!\n\nDo visit [leafywell.com](https://www.leafywell.com/)\u00a0for more information on products, flavours and offers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 293082, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Companies that use blogs to speak to customers improving sales and investor confidence.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uo1zp/companies_that_use_blogs_to_speak_to_customers/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "ElzaHovh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_157iya", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541509719, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uo5e1/help_with_investment/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9uo5e1", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9uo5e1/help_with_investment/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1541509720, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 293086, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help with investment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uo5e1/help_with_investment/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"author": "ElzaHovh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_157iya", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541510360, "domain": "self.stocks", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uo82e/help_with_investment/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9uo82e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/9uo82e/help_with_investment/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1541510361, "score": 1, "selftext": " Hi all,I want to start investing in stocks.

The report was very clear. Apple has built a business that has so much going for it now and focusing on how many new phones they sold is missing the point. I think they knew eventually the smart phone market was going to cool honestly because they have perfected it to the point that upgrading is not really as necessary as it used to be. I have the Iphone XS and it can do pretty much everything you could possibly want it to. Its fast, its well designed, it's durable, the camera is awesome, face id is seamless, the apps can literally recognize things that they need to do before you even think of doing it yourself. It's just....hard to really imagine needing something better, Thats why their customers will pay a premium to upgrade , but really it is what the customer does with the phone after that apple sees as a much bigger opportunity. The apps, the music subscription, apple pay, icloud, the camera, messaging, streaming, you name it. all of that can be monetized and it is not as cyclical and iphone sales so theyd be stupid not to make that part of their business the focus. people use the phone everyday, they will only shop for the phone what once every two years? Why is that 1 transaction so much more important than the other 600 days the user spends on the device. It's like judging the profitability of facebook by how many people downloaded the app on a particular day.  Anyone that thinks the iphone slowing has anything to do with the actual profitability of the company is clueless and cook even said if the unit number was significant in some way he would mention it so it's not about transparency really. I think it was just something to nitpick at and distract from the fact that services, the watch, the laptop, music, pay and everything else was so strong that it can carry the business. The guidance really wasnt that bad either. They are expecting to hit new record profits and continue to introduce a bunch of new products to their customers. Thought they killed it but the stock is selling off like they did something wrong. I'd be a buyer here for sure. The analyst community knows it was a great quarter and they saw a chance to get it for cheap. Cook I guess could have been an ass like Musk and told them to stop asking dumb questions but he actually answered questions about it multiple times. He argued that if 1 unit generates more revenue than 100 used to why does it matter? It has always been a number used by the analysts to burry the company  and that is probably something Cook just doesnt want to deal with anymore. Who cares? The company will buyback the panic any way and beat estimates again so why are people selling the stock based on one very small part of the report?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

However a lot of users downvote because they disagree with the title or OP.\n\nFor example [\"Please convince me that 2019 DJIA will be up 20% or more\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9t6bgz/please_convince_me_that_2019_djia_will_be_up_20/) gets downvoted (0 points, 25% upvoted, 1.4k views), which is unfortunate because OP put in a decent amount of effort.  The comment replies were pretty good, it's a good read overall (post &amp; comments).\n\nWhile a relatively low quality post received 129 points [Dividend people!!!](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9tr1kh/dividend_people/)  The mods missed out on removing it before a flood of comments came in.  Sometimes we won't remove low quality posts because users already put in effort into their comments.\n\nBut the point here is that the 2nd OP didn't put in effort and it got upvoted triple digits, while the 1st OP did put in effort and his post got 0 points.\n\n-----\nfrom Reddit's own [reddiquette page:](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)\n\n&gt; * Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.\n\n&gt; * {don't} Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.\n\n&gt; * {don't} Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.\n\n&gt; * {don't} Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source. Quality of content is more important than who created it.\n\n&gt; * {don't} Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.\n\n&gt; * {don't} Report posts just because you do not like them. You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules.\n-----\n\ntl;dr  Upvote posts that add value to r/stocks even if you disagree with OP, downvote posts that don't add value even if you agree w/ OP, **or else** you're just gonna get a bunch of low quality posts.  **If you don't want to see a post, just click/tap hide**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 293053, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "the voting system &amp;
