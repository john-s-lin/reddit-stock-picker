I believe they will have a great quarter with beats across the board. If you don't want to read this block of text and prefer watching in video format, that is available here: https://youtu.be/Kyh1H33NFJM\n\nI'm expecting this year to be one of Apple's best years ever, especially since they just released the iPhone X, consumer spending was at an all time high, and because their services business is exploding.\n\nWhat I did for some research was to go on Amazon.com Best Sellers list, and checked to see how Apple-related products did in the Cellphone &amp; Accessories department.\n\nSo looking at Top 20:\n\n* -12/20 were products specifically for Apple - they claimed spots 2,3,5,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18\n\n* -Out of these 12 spots, 2 were iPhone X: #8 and #13\n\n\nLooking at Top 50:\n\n* -26/50 were specifically for Apple\n\n* -rank 32 and 38 were again specifically for iPhone X\n\nThis gives us a good idea as to how we can expect iPhone sales to be, because if people are purchasing new accessories (especially ones specifically for iPhone X), that means they also purchased a new iPhone X, and/or someone they know purchased an iPhone X. Note Apple doesn't earn revenue from these accessories, but again, it's indicative of what phones consumers are purchasing. Google's Pixel 2 was released around the same time, but you don't see any accessories (like cases, screen protectors, etc.) for this phone in the top 20 (or 50?).\n\nNext I look at other products by Apple or for Apple products at the best sellers in overall Electronics:\n\n* -#46 spot is Apple 4K TV\n\n* -#57,59,64,65,69,75 were also Apple or apple released\n\nNo doubt that Apple will beat numbers on their Apple 4K TV as sales have been strong here, and most were not expecting this.\n\nAdditionally, Apple sells iPads, Apple Music, Apple Watch, Macs desktops and Macbooks. Numbers from last quarter were outstanding across the board, and I don't think this quarter will be any different especially since this was a record year for the holiday season like I mentioned. \n\nI also want to address the App store. Revenue from App Purchases rose 35% in 2017 and Apple reportedly keeps 15% of this revenue. As a reference, from December 24 - December 31, 890M in app purchases were made, and on New Years Day alone (which won't be part of the upcoming earnings report), there was another 300M in sales. This shows that the Apple ecosystem is stronger than ever.\n\nFinally, I want to address Apples Services business. Their revenue for last quarter was 8.5B vs 6.32B expected - which is a 34.5% beat. For a company of Apples size, to beat by this much is just mind blowing and its important to note that services is very profitable for Apple, so they are collecting a lot of the revenue from this which just adds to their 260B+ cash balance.\n\nSo to close off, this is what analysis expect for this quarter: EPS 3.75 vs EPS 3.36 from the same quarter last year. Apple themselves in the last earnings call has said that they expect 84-87B in revenue. \n\nSo we'll find out in a few weeks if Apple can beat these numbers and send the stock in an upward momentum to $200/share and if they will become the worlds first 1 TRILLON dollar company.\n\n\n#Apple reports their quarter results on February 1, 2018.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "stocks", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjfk", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should you buy Apple before ER?
